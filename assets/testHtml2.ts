<p dir="ltr">Ferdinand held Rozemyne as she poured mana into the branch from Erwaermen, her breathing slowing and her strength waning. With great effort, she removed her hand from the feystone holding the branch and pulled something from her belt, pressing it into his palm. His mana was pulled into the object, and he looked down to see his name stone. Shock, confusion, anger, and pain shot through him. The reason she'd held it was so he could be near her while she still had the gods' mana, and the second it was depleted, she'd given it back to him. How eagerly had she been waiting fot his moment? How much did she detest his ultimate symbol of loyalty?</p><p dir="ltr">With his name stone safely out of her possession, she put her hand back on the feystone and pushed out the last of the gods' mana still within her. He quickly cast Flutrane’s healing before laying her down and placing the mind-reading magic tool on her head. Once he secured the one for himself, he poured his jureve in her mouth. It trickled out from her pale lips, and the first pang of worry struck him. Eventually, he managed to get enough of it down her throat to perform the mind-reading.</p><p dir="ltr">Once they were connected, he called out to her, but he received no response. Again and again, he called, his heart speeding up each time he received no answer. She hadn’t been silent this long even when she was in Mestionora’s library. Reluctantly, he reached towards her mind only to find memories that were blurred and fragmented, just like the criminals who’d died before being captured.</p><p dir="ltr">The wild emotions swirling in him severed the connection. Once he came back to himself, he checked Rozemyne’s neck for a pulse and felt his blood run cold. He was unable to sense any mana flowing in her, nor could he feel her breath against his hand. In desperation, he pressed his ear to her chest to listen for a heartbeat only for her melt away in his arms. The cold tinkle of her feystone clattering against the floor deafened him as Schneeahst's ice washed over him.</p><p dir="ltr">He stared at the light yellow feystone, waiting for the nightmarish vision to end. “No,” he breathed, brushing his fingers against its smooth surface. Hot tears filled his vision and streamed down his cheeks as a pain more intense than anything he’d experienced before pressed down on him. The weight finally broke him, wrenching bitter sobs from his crumpled form. He'd been too late. He'd let her pour out too much. He'd failed her, as she had known he would. That was why she had given back his name stone.</p><p dir="ltr">When he could breathe again, he gasped, “This was supposed to… They said…”</p><p dir="ltr">The weight on him cracked as fury burst through him. He’d make them pay. Every last one of those gods who’d poured their mana into her would feel his wrath - and he’d start with that damned tree.</p><p dir="ltr">He scooped up her feystone and stormed out of the supply chamber.</p><p dir="ltr">Her aides turned to him, panic in their eyes. “Lord Ferdinand!” Angelica called. “Lady Rozemyne is…?”</p><p dir="ltr">One look at him confirmed all their fears, and Lieseleta collapsed, her hands covering her mouth. “So it’s true. When Gretia fell–”</p><p dir="ltr">Ferdinand didn’t hear the rest as he continued his march out the room and down the hall. Justus eventually caught up to him as he reached the chamber with the transportation circle to the Royal Academy. “My Lord! What happened? Where are you going?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Stay here,” he commanded as he stepped onto the circle.</p><p dir="ltr">Justus paled, but his face became serious. “And if you don’t come back?”</p><p dir="ltr">The look in his attendant’s eye said he knew Ferdinand wasn’t planning on returning. With the Zent now dead and the only one with Wisdom likely soon to follow, it didn’t really matter what they did. The country was doomed to fall either way. Still, he would extend one last comfort to the man who’d dedicated his name to him all those years ago - a ray of hope to keep his mind off the inevitable. “Have Charlotte dye the foundation.” With that, he activated the circle.</p><p dir="ltr">When the gold and black swirling mana faded, he stood in the Alexandria dorms. They were deserted, given they were between the winter term and Archduke Conference. Between the lack of personnel and the sudden death of the new Zent distracting what remained, he had little difficulty reaching the stage for the dedication whirl. He loathed the idea of giving anything more to the gods who’d taken Rozemyne from him, but he danced nevertheless until the statues of the gods moved and the path opened.</p><p dir="ltr">“[Water gun],” he chanted as he entered the Garden of Beginnings. He fired the moment he stepped over the threshold, but his arrows dissipated against a yellow shield surrounding Erwaermen.</p><p dir="ltr">“Verfuhremeer,” the former god called, looking upward, “your assistance, please.”</p><p dir="ltr">An unnatural calm settled over Ferdinand, smothering even his desire to fight against it.</p><p dir="ltr">“Quinta, Mestionora has informed me of what transpired, and she’s been negotiating with the other gods on your behalf.”</p><p dir="ltr">Ferdinand’s brows rose. “To what end? Will she speak with Ewigeliebe and have Rozemyne brought back?”</p><p dir="ltr">Erwaermen shook his head. “You know she can’t meet with him. However, she has invoked the help of Dregarnuhr who wishes to see this weave corrected. Myne’s thread was not meant to snap here.”</p><p dir="ltr">He froze as he sped through several mental calculations. “You’re planning to unravel the weave?”</p><p dir="ltr">“Dregarnuhr will send you back to an earlier point in your thread, hopefully one far enough back to prevent Myne’s being cut too short while preserving as much of the weave as possible, but you two must still complete your Wisdom. Without a true Zent, my garden will perish, and you’ve already made your position clear on your acceptance of the role.”</p><p dir="ltr">Anger flashed through Ferdinand. “Do you plan to try to force Rozemyne–”</p><p dir="ltr">“No,” Erwaermen cut him off. “You can install a temporary Zent as you did this time, but you must still provide us with true Zent candidates.”</p><p dir="ltr">Ferdinand tapped his temple as he thought through all those who would meet the qualifications. “Easier said than done. Few people gain all seven colors before obtaining their schtappes, especially since students now obtain them their first year. I won’t have the power to change that policy.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Your children should have the colors, should they not?” Erwaremen asked. “Do not you and Myne both have the protection of the divine couple and the eternal five?”</p><p dir="ltr">“You assume we’ll marry.”  It didn't matter that they were technically already engaged in the weave. She hadn't truly accepted, and the events that allowed him to manipulate her into the position might not reoccur in the next weave.</p><p dir="ltr">“Is she not already dyed in your colors?”</p><p dir="ltr">Ferdinand glared at him. “<em>Was</em>. And that wasn't-”</p><p dir="ltr">“That is no matter. You will be reunited with her soon. Now, Dregarn–”</p><p dir="ltr">“Wait,” he said, holding up a hand. “I have conditions.”</p><p dir="ltr">Erwaermen studied him for a long moment and then asked, “They are?”</p><p dir="ltr">“First, I demand to know when I’ll be sent back to.”</p><p dir="ltr">The former god looked up for a moment then back to Ferdinand. “About a year after her baptism.”</p><p dir="ltr">That was before her coma. In that case… “Second, give Rozemyne a healthy body and help her grow so she looks her age.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Anwachs? Very well. As he’s done this for her before, he shall do it again.”</p><p dir="ltr">“Third, I’ll need all the materials I’ve gathered in this weave, including those branches we used to restore Alexandria.”</p><p dir="ltr">Erwaermen looked up again and spoke with the ceiling for a while before sighing with a nod. “Very well, but that is the last concession you will be given. Now, prepare yourself. Dregarnuhr will wait no longer.”</p><p dir="ltr">As a sickening sensation washed over him, Ferdinand grasped Rozemyne’s feystone to his breast, trying to take comfort in the warm mana within it.</p><p dir="ltr">He’d be with his family again soon.</p>

<p>Papery leaves rusted in the wind, punctuated by the cries of scampering animals fleeing through the night. The smell of blood and rinsham filled Ferdinand’s nose as he became aware of a gentle weight against him. He looked down to see a small, unresponsive Rozemyne in his arms. Seeing her limp, cold body nearly drove him into the same despair that’d threatened to crush him only a bell ago, but his rational memory took over before his emotions could. This was the night Rozemyne was poisoned. She was still alive.</p><p>He tucked the cloth wrapped around her tighter and rested her head against his shoulder, trying to give her enough space to breathe and make her as comfortable as possible, knowing she was somewhat aware of her surroundings, even if she couldn’t so much as open her eyes.</p><p>Why would the gods send him to this moment when he was already powerless to do anything? Hadn’t they agreed to give her a healthy body? Why wait until it was too late to prevent the damage that put her to sleep for two years? For that matter, in what world was this a year after her baptism? They were two whole seasons past the promised point.</p><p>Then again, these were the gods they were talking about. When twenty years was an imminent deadline, two seasons was a blink of an eye.</p><p>“Ferdinand, wait!” Bonifatius’ loud, commanding voice boomed from right next to him. “I’ll look after her in my estate!”</p><p>His heated gaze snapped up as he held Rozemyne tighter, all noble politeness falling away as he felt the life leaving her for a second time in so many bells. “I am the only one who can save Rozemyne right now! <em>Do not interfere!</em>”</p><p>As he prepared to pull out his highbeast, Cornelius’ shockingly high-pitched voice called out, “Grandfather, please leave Rozemyne to Lord Ferdinand.” He came barreling out of the woods, holding out his hand. “Lord Ferdinand, take this! It’s Rozemyne’s feystone.” Once he reached them, he pulled open the cage at her hip and dropped the stone inside.</p><p>As the boy began offering his apologies to her, Ferdinand barked, “If you’re truly sorry, go capture the ones who harmed her. That worm Bonifatius crushed was just a servant. And Bonifatius, if you can’t capture them alive, at least leave their heads intact so we can view their memories.” This time, he <em>would</em> get the evidence he needed against Gerlach, and even if he didn’t, there were many other ways he could trap the serpent now that he knew what to look for.</p><p>Cornelius and Bonifatius ran off in the direction the boy had heard hoofbeats. Once Ferdinand was on his highbeast streaking towards the temple, he leaned down and whispered, “Rozemyne, I will save you no matter what.” His voice caught in his throat, but he swallowed the lump back down and begged, “So please, fight the poison as long as you can.” The quick bobbing of his highbeast caused her to slip a little down his shoulder, so he readjusted her and gently tucked the loose strands of night-blue hair back into the cloth wrapping, silently cursing the gods for throwing him from one of the worst nights in his life to the other. Was this Mestionora’s revenge for attacking Erwaermen? Were the first twenty-one years of his life not filled with enough suffering to entertain them?</p><p>Rather than voicing his outrage, he bit his tongue and tried to check his anger. It would do no good to offend those he still gained to profit from.</p><p>Once he arrived at the temple, he all but ran down the halls until he reached the High Bishop’s chambers. “Open it!” he called, unable to reach the door handle with Rozemyne in his arms.</p><p>Fran wrenched it open with a gasp. “High Priest, what bri– Lady Rozemyne?!”</p><p>“She was poisoned. I am going to fetch the antidote. Change her into something white while I go to my workshop. Do not remove the cloth from her mouth.”</p><p>“Understood.”</p><p>He forced his grip to relax enough to allow Fran to take Rozemyne’s frail form from his arms. His irrational instincts cried out at the loss he felt as she slipped from his grasp, feeling his control of the situation follow in her wake. While he wanted to take her with him to his workshop to get the antidote in her that much sooner, she needed to get into her jureve more, and they couldn’t afford to delay long enough to accommodate the detour.</p><p>Instead, he raced out of the room the moment she was securely in Fran’s arms and into his own chambers. He burst into his workshop and panicked as his eyes scanned through the mess. It’d been years since he’d last seen it in this state, and for a moment, he felt lost as he stared at the piles of papers and haphazard stacks of materials. In the middle of the floor, a pile of teardrop-shaped rainbow feystones, white branches, and various other materials he’d gathered since this point took up most of the available walking space. Did Mestionora’s rage extend so far as to harass him at a time like this?</p><p>With no small degree of effort, he refocused his mind and recalled that he always kept antidotes in the same place so he could reach them no matter his state of mind. Grabbing the necessary potion and dropper from the appropriate drawer, he slammed both his workshop and chamber doors shut and sped into Rozemyne’s rooms.</p><p>When he entered, her attendants had just slipped her dress off, her limp form suspended in the air by a trembling Fran. “Leave her in her underclothes.” He almost commanded them to bring her to them as she was, but the chill in the air would do her more harm than the time it would take to protect her from it. “Wrap her in a blanket for warmth and bring her to me.” At the wide-eyed stare he received from the female attendants, he barked, “We do not have any time to waste, and she will be using her jureve after the antidote is applied regardless.” They would only waste more time stripping her down again if they decided to dress her now. Once Monika had wrapped her in the blanket, Ferdinand sat down and held out his hands. “Fran, give her to me.” His eyes all but yelled, <em>Now!</em></p><p>Once she was safe in his arms again, he stuck the dropper full of potion in her mouth and slowly dripped it down her throat. His hand trembled as flashes of red liquid trickling from the corner of her mouth invaded his mind, but he shook visions away. Once he finished giving her the appropriate dose, he checked her pulse and sighed, nearly collapsing with the relief of feeling the heartbeat beneath his fingertips. “I wasn’t too late this time.”</p><p>“This time…?” Nicola asked only to be censured by Fran.</p><p>“High Priest,” he said as he approached, “I will take her now so you can prepare her jureve.”</p><p>“Very well. Make sure you hold her like this and mind the position of her tongue so it doesn’t prevent her breathing.” He stood to let Fran sit, and only once the attendant was positioned to his liking did he hand Rozemyne over.</p><p>After ensuring she was being held properly, he went into her hidden room and got to work preparing her jureve. First, he poured some of the potion into a cup. Then, he set up all the magic circles necessary for this process, from the one resting at the bottom of the soaking tub to the ones that connected the cauldron full of jureve and the pitcher he’d use to transfer it. “Fran,” he called, opening the door to the room. “Bring her.” He wouldn’t wait until she was able to move enough to reach out to the feystone lock herself. Her mana was hardening, and time was of the essence.</p><p>“Fran,” Rozeymne mumbled, “please deliver the letter to Lutz. Handle temple affairs as you would if I were in the castle. All my attendants are very skilled, so I imagine things will continue to run smoothly. Please do your best. And Ferdinand–”</p><p>“Here, drink this,” he said, holding the cup up to her lips. Fran moved to take it, but when Ferdinand refused to relinquish it, he instead went back to simply holding her. Rozemyne reached weak, trembling hands up to hold the cup, and Ferdinand supported her by the elbow while chiding her, “Fool, don’t try to hold it yourself when you can barely move.”</p><p>Her muddy gaze sharpened in a glare, and he couldn’t stop the smirk it brought to his face. It was such a relief to see even a fraction of her stupidly honest expressions again. He nodded to Fran to help her finish before turning to fill the tub.</p><p>“Wow,” she said, “it’s almost like the pitcher and the cauldron are connected…”</p><p>He’d almost forgotten how amazed even these basic magic circles had made her before she’d gone to the academy. “They are,” he said. “Now Rozemyne, you’re going to sleep for some time.”</p><p>“Right, about my personnel back at the castle…”</p><p>“I’ll bring them back to the temple.”</p><p>She graced him with a warm, heart-rending smile. “I thank you ever so…much.” Her words trailed off into a yawn. “I’m feeling sleepy.”</p><p>“That would be the potion,” he said, setting down the pitcher. “That should be enough. Here.” Fran handed her over at his prompting, and he slowly lowered her into the jureve. Her mana lines lit up red along her body, and while his checks showed her mana wasn’t quite as bad as he recalled in the first weave, it didn’t seem improved enough to reduce her slumber by any significant amount. “Rozemyne, I shall eliminate all those who threaten you, and I will protect those important to you. You may now fall asleep here.”</p><p>Again, she turned that sweet smile on him. “I will entrust everything to you, then.” Her eyes then clouded with worry as she asked, “Will you be here when I wake up?”</p><p>Had she shown this much neediness during her first slumber? He didn’t think so. She’d been much more challant about it. Perhaps putting her in the jureve sooner allowed her to show more of her emotions this time. He leaned down and said, “Of course I will. Rest well, Rozemyne.”</p><p>Her eyes drifted shut, and he lay her back, watching as she sank deep into the potion.</p><p>“Fran.”</p><p>“Yes, High Priest?”</p><p>“Go get her chambers in order, and sort through her documents. Make sure you find all the instructions she left behind and prepare them to be sent tomorrow. You will need to inform the rest of her attendants of this tomorrow as well.”</p><p>“Yes, High Priest.”</p><p>Once Fran left, Ferdinand gripped the side of the ivory tub and glared up at the ceiling. “This isn’t what we agreed upon.” Naturally, no answer came, not that he expected one. The gods had gotten what they wanted from him, and they knew he wouldn’t allow a world where Rozemyne lived to crumble to sand. Just when did she become such a glaring weakness for him?</p><p>As he watched her small, childish form floating in the jureve, he finally paused long enough to evaluate his feelings towards her. Her adult form had been so ethereally beautiful that he’d thought her divine. Combine that with her being not only the one person who truly cared about him in a way he’d never thought possible but also the only woman he’d been able to sense after reaching his autumn - save that one exception he wouldn’t devote any mental faculties to - and it was no wonder he’d wanted her as Ewigeliebe wanted Geduldh. While those feelings stirred in him when he remembered her as she was, her childhood visage only stoked the protectiveness of Erwachlerhren, much to his relief. He could imagine few things worse than becoming <em>that</em> sort of man.</p><p>That said, he couldn’t allow her to languish under a forced engagement with Wilfried a second time. Not only did it end up making everyone involved miserable, it didn’t even serve to protect her from that which they feared most - the Sovereignty stealing her away. He couldn’t guarantee they’d experience the same sequence of events that led to her second engagement’s dissolution, either, especially when he had no way to predict how the gods would move. Naturally, his preferred solution was to have her engaged to himself, and though he would have liked for that to happen closer to her autumn than not, he knew circumstances wouldn’t allow for that. It was going to be a headache to plan. He’d need to simultaneously convince Sylvester to give up on Wilfried succeeding him, ensure neither Ferdinand himself nor Rozemyne could inherit the position, and somehow contain the Liesegangs once their engagement was announced.</p><p>Well, he’d have to dwell on it later. For now, he needed to head to the castle.</p>

<p>Ferdinand needed to decide what to do about Giebe Gerlach. If he didn’t handle this carefully, all of Rozemyne’s Former-Veronica-Faction name sworn would be killed. He had enough information that he was certain he could trap Gerlach when they interrogated him the next day, but then their entire family would be executed, costing Rozemyne one of her most loyal knights. Plus, as much as he wanted the man dead, Gerlach would be much more useful as a tool to lure out Georgine.</p><p>When the ordonnanz came announcing they’d captured the culprit, Ferdinand went to the castle and waited for Bonifatius to drag in Viscount Joisontak. The questioning proceeded much like it had before, with Joisontak confessing to his moronic plan and that he’d obtained the devouring soldiers that had launched an attack in the hall from Gerlach. Once Sylvester had Joisontak taken away, Ferdinand said, “Bonifatius, when you scanned the grand hall after Wilfried’s guard knights reported the attack, did you see Giebe Gerlach among the attendants?”</p><p>Bonifatius frowned as he crossed his arms and closed his eyes. “It’s hard to say, but no, I don’t recall seeing him in particular.”</p><p>“And was he among those who were in the restroom when the room was sealed?”</p><p>One of the guard knights spoke up. “No, Lord Ferdinand. He wasn’t.”</p><p>Sylvester leaned forward. “What are you implying? The room was sealed, and he was there when we released everyone. He couldn’t have gotten out.”</p><p>Ferdinand cast his eyes down and said, “Have the room cleared.”</p><p>Once everyone save for the archducal family and Karstedt left, Ferdinand asked, “Were the servants’ entrances also sealed?”</p><p>“Of course,” Karstedt replied.</p><p>“And is there no other passage, perhaps known to only the archducal family or the archduke himself?”</p><p>Sylvester’s face became blank and Bonifatius raised a brow at him as tension filled the air. He would need to tread carefully here.</p><p>“I ask not for such information to be revealed to those gathered here. I only ask if there is a possibility that Gerlach might have found a way to slip out undetected.”</p><p>“If such a passageway existed,” Sylvester said, “how would he know of it if even you don’t?”</p><p>“You were not always the archduke candidate favored to inherit the duchy.”</p><p>Bonifatius’ eyes widened before they met Sylvester’s and darted to the supply room entrance. While the two of them discussed matters within, Karstedt asked, “How long will Rozemyne be asleep?”</p><p>“At least a year or more,” Ferdinand replied, hoping the gods would do something beneficial for a change and shorten her time in the jureve.</p><p>“What?” he gasped. “You can’t be serious.”</p><p>“Unfortunately, I am,” he sighed. “The poison hardened a significant amount of her mana. It is a wonder she is still alive.”</p><p>Karstedt held his head in his hands. “She’s only eight, and she’s already lost so much. Her health, her family, and now a year of her life… It’s unreasonable how many trials Glucklitat forces on her.”</p><p>“Glucklitat cares nothing for age or circumstance,” he spat bitterly, causing Karstedt to snap his gaze to him in shock before looking away again.</p><p>Eventually, Bonifatius and Sylvester returned, the latter pale and grimacing. “It seems Georgine went to Giebe Gerlach’s estate for tea during her visit. I’ll summon him for questioning tomorrow. In the meantime, we should read Joisontak’s memories to see if we can determine how he was manipulated into attacking tonight. Hopefully, between that and the interrogation tomorrow, we’ll have enough evidence to take Gerlach down.”</p><p>“Wait, Sylvester,” Ferdinand said. “Unless Gerlach is an utter fool who incriminates himself tomorrow, we should let him go.”</p><p>“What?” he snapped, his face flushing red with rage, just as Bonifatius let out a loud, “What are you saying!?”</p><p>Sylvester pounded the table, shocking even Bonifatius to silence. “The man attacked my children! <em>My children!</em> Charlotte got kidnapped, and Rozemyne nearly died! You expect me to let the man responsible walk away? Are you telling me that you, Rozemyne’s guardian, don’t even care about what happened to her?”</p><p>Ferdinand let his mana drain into the charms hidden on his person as fire fueled his glare. “I care a great deal, which is why I want to catch everyone involved, including the person pulling Gerlach’s strings. If we let him go, he’ll go scampering back to his master, leading us right to her. We can use him to gather enough information to take all of our enemies down in one fell swoop. While there are obviously other nobles in the Georgine faction, we don’t know which ones are in direct contact with her - save for Gerlach.”</p><p>“You think Georgine ordered this?” Sylvester asked, his brows raised. “Why?”</p><p>“For a myriad of reasons, but chiefly to hurt you, the person who took the seat of aub away from her and to hurt Rozemyne, the person responsible for her dear uncle’s death. You say she tormented you up until the point she left the duchy. Surely you know, then, how vindictive she is.”</p><p>The color drained from Sylvester’s face as he slumped back in his chair. In a small voice, he said, “She’s going to kill my adoptive daughter, isn’t she?”</p><p>“SHE’S NOT LAYING A HAND ON MY GRANDDAUGHTER!” Bonifatius punched the air several times, releasing some of his built-up energy.</p><p>Karstedt nodded. “We’ll need to increase the number of Rozemyne’s guard knights.”</p><p>“Charlotte’s, too,” Sylvester said. After a moment, he ran a hand down his face and muttered, “We don’t have enough personnel to cover three children of the archduke, and things will only get worse when Melchior’s baptized. We can’t pick guard knights from the Veronica Faction, either, since we don’t know for certain who’s siding with Georgine.”</p><p>“It’ll be more difficult to get retainers for Rozemyne,” Karstedt sighed. “With her being in her jureve for at least a year, most in the playroom will–”</p><p>“WHAAAAT? A YEAR? WHAT DO YOU MEAN A YEAR? FERDINAND! EXPLAIN YOURSELF!”</p><p>Ferdinand rubbed his temples and glared at Bonifatius. He felt a migraine coming on, and these unnecessary shouts weren’t helping matters. This was going to be a long night.</p><p> </p><p>Joisontak’s memories revealed that Gerlach entrusted the devouring soldiers to him during the summer roughly a fortnight after Georgine’s visit. More disturbing, however, was how fragmented and distorted some of his memories were. All Karstedt could say for sure was he had spoken with Gerlach recently. It was impossible to determine exactly when or what was said, though all present in the archduke’s chambers could guess.</p><p>That was alarming news. Ferdinand hadn’t expected they were using trug this early, nor that they would employ it on a throw-away like Joinsontak. Gerlach was nothing if not careful.</p><p>While Karstedt was searching Joisontak’s memories, Bonifatius and Sylvester were conducting their own investigation. Though neither said anything, it was obvious they had gone to check the secret passage, and their pallor when they returned proved it’d been used.</p><p>“The evidence suggests, then, that Georgine gave orders to capture Rozemyne, and Gerlach manipulated Joinsontak into getting her out of the castle,” Ferdinand said. “He likely told that fool about the shack in the woods to direct him to where he could take possession of her without being detected.”</p><p>“How do you figure they were trying to capture her instead of kill her?” Sylvester asked. “Didn’t they poison her?”</p><p>Ferdinand shook his head. “That poison is typically used to incapacitate. However, a normal dose is lethal to someone Rozemyne’s size.” Careful as he was, Gerlach had forgotten to account for that small detail, which meant he was likely to make other mistakes that would leave holes to exploit.</p><p>“You said he probably wanted to capture her for my sister, right?” Sylvester asked. “How were they planning to get her across the border? There’s no way I wouldn’t be alerted to someone with as much mana as Rozemyne crossing over.”</p><p>That was what he was wondering as well. Had they already obtained the silver cloth from Lanzenave? He was certain they’d received those from the envoy after he’d been moved to Ahrensbach. “It could be they planned to hold her until next summer and have her cross over with Georgine. Would you be able to tell if they took Rozemyne with them, given all the archnobles she’d have with her?”</p><p>Sylvester grimaced. “Probably not.” A violent shudder ran over him as he held his stomach. “Just thinking about what they might have done to her makes me sick.”</p><p>Bonifatius growled, “I’ll crush his skull with my own hands. How dare he plan to do such things to my only granddaughter!”</p><p>“Father, please, calm yourself,” Karstedt said. “We won’t be able to get any evidence from him if you do that.”</p><p>“We need concrete enough proof of his involvement to justify reading his memories,” Ferdinand said, tapping his temple. Even so, he imagined Georgine had used trug any time she discussed these sorts of matters with her underlings. Rather than pursue this particular incident, it would likely prove more fruitful to expose Gerlach as name sworn to the first wife of Ahrensbach, marking him the traitor he was.</p><p>The questioning of Gerlach proceeded much the same way as before. He claimed he was but an innocent victim in all this, having given Joinsontak the devouring soldiers - that he of course had never officially owned - to reduce the financial burden on his house. He only had them because Bindewald couldn’t bring so many soldiers with him into the city, and he had supposedly been allowed to enter at the time.</p><p>And there it was - the little detail Gerlach missed. There was no way he wouldn’t have known that no permits were being issued to foreign nobles at the time. Since Bezewanst didn’t participate in noble social gatherings, he hadn’t heard, and while Veronica had known better, she’d been so drunk on power that she saw no issue forging documents for her dear little brother. Gerlach, too, had been informed, but he had obviously forgotten that small detail from over a year ago. It was always the small things with him.</p><p>Still, Ferdinand kept his peace. While he could use that glaring hole in Gerlach’s testimony to have him immediately imprisoned, searched, and executed, keeping him alive would better serve his purposes. He had several things he wanted to happen again in this weave, such as forming Alexandria, as well as those he wanted to avoid repeating, namely getting engaged to Detlinde. If he managed to dodge being forced into Ahrensbach, he’d need a different reason for Rozemyne to steal their foundation, and Gerlach was going to help provide it when the time was right.</p>

<p>Once Giebe Gerlach was dismissed, Ferdinand requested to speak with Sylvester alone. After pouring vize for the two of them, he picked up his glass and leaned back in his chair. “So, what is it?”</p><p>“Vize this early?” Ferdinand asked.</p><p>“I haven’t slept since yesterday. Let me have this.”</p><p>With a sigh, Ferdinand tapped his finger against the table and said, “Rozemyne’s absence leaves us with several holes to fill, not least of which is her mana. You know how important it is for Spring Prayer.”</p><p>Sylvester nodded. “Yeah, the central districts will barely scrape by without it.”</p><p>“As I will be taking on all of her temple work as well as managing the orphanage and at least a portion of the printing industry, not to mention keeping an eye on Rozemyne, I will not be able to visit all of her districts as well as my own. Charlotte and Wilfried will need to participate.”</p><p>“But they’re so young!” he balked. “Charlotte was just baptized! She can’t control her mana that well.”</p><p>“Rozemyne is young, too, lest you forget,” Ferdinand snapped. “Or are you saying it’s acceptable for her to do all the tasks you’ve piled on her shoulders, but it’s too arduous for your own children to do even a portion of it?”</p><p>Sylvester frowned into his cup for several moments before shaking his head. “That’s not what I meant. She’s just so exceptional that sometimes it’s hard to forget she’s actually just a little kid, you know? She’s just like you in that way.”</p><p>“We are nothing alike. I have an actual work ethic. She must be plied with books.” <em>And hugs,</em> he added mentally with a grimace. Gods help him if anyone ever found out about that.</p><p>“And like Dunklefelger didn’t play you like a harspiel by dangling research materials in front of you every time they wanted to ditter.”</p><p>If it weren’t for Veronica, he would have been able to afford many of those materials with the budget owed to an archduke candidate. Between suffering under her neglect and trying to help fund Hirschur’s lab after she’d been cut off, he’d had little choice but to jump at any opportunity to get what he needed.</p><p>“That is neither here nor there,” Ferdinand said, waving off the comment. “I’m proposing that you allow me to educate both Charlotte and Wilfried in magic.”</p><p>“You’re kind of a tough teacher, aren’t you?”</p><p>Tapping a finger against his temple, Ferdinand sighed and shot his older brother a glare. “Sylvester, did you or did you not cut your own support base out from under you last year?”</p><p>His face sobered up. “Yeah, I did.”</p><p>“Has that or has that not stirred up the Liesegangs, who now have a princess to rally behind?”</p><p>“Yeah, it did. What’s your point?”</p><p>“As much as you may not want to, you need to honestly compare Rozemyne to your two baptized children because the rest of the duchy certainly is. She’s so far ahead of them that they have no hope of catching up if things remain as they are, even if she sleeps until the very day before she enters the Royal Academy. While you may view me as harsh, they would suffer infinitely less under my tutelage than they would under the Liesegangs’ scrutiny. Or do you want to make Rozemyne the archduchess?”</p><p>Sylvester blinked at him and then looked up as he pondered the question. “Maybe we should go ahead and engage her to Wilfried, then?”</p><p>“No,” Ferdinand snapped, only to wince at Sylvester’s surprised look. “Think about it. She already has more mana than you. Do you really think Wilfried has any hope of matching her? Even if you aren’t concerned about denying her children in the future - children she <em>might</em> be able to have after healing her body in the jureve - do you think the Liesegangs will suffer their princess being a second or even third wife?”</p><p>“That’s easy enough. We’ll make her first wife.”</p><p>“And how would you then obtain any other wives for him? No other duchy will send their daughter to a middle-ranked one as a second wife, much less a third. First wives are meant to be taken from other duchies so they can negotiate with them at archduke conferences. At best, you might find someone desperate enough to marry under those conditions who could produce children with Wilfried, but that would undermine Rozemyne’s position and anger the Liesegangs - the very core of what would be his support base. At worst, you doom your line in a short-sighted attempt to favor your unexceptional firstborn.”</p><p>Shaking his head, Sylvester leaned forward on his elbows and pointed a finger from the hand holding his goblet at him. “You’re getting really stirred up about this. You’re more attached to her than I thought.”</p><p>“It has nothing to do with attachment,” he sighed. “I’m simply fed up with your allowing the feud with Georgine to keep you from seeing your children as they actually are. Stop projecting your issues on them and take an honest look at them. Compare Charlotte, who was baptized the same day she debuted to Wilfried who had two entire seasons before he did. Surely you can see that even with hard work, he’ll never catch up to her, not when she’s always taken her studies seriously. He’s simply too far behind at this point, not to mention the Tower incident staining his reputation.”</p><p>A long, tense silence stretched between them as they glared at each other. Eventually, Sylvester took a sip of his vize, maintaining eye contact all the while, and asked, “What would you have me do, then, Brother?”</p><p>“Do not name an official heir. Allow them to compete fairly. If things turn sour, name either Charlotte or Melchior your successor and have done with it. We can easily rally the duchy around either one of them.”</p><p>“And what of Wilfried?”</p><p>“Is it not obvious?” Ferdinand scoffed. “The boy loves to run around and play with his wooden sword more than anything. Have him take both the archduke and knight courses. He’s not suited to paperwork regardless, and he’d be happier as a guard knight for one of his siblings than chained to his desk.” With a shrug, he added, “Perhaps, though, he’ll prove me wrong, and the spirit of competition will spur him to greater heights, as Rozemyne is always professing. In the meantime, though, you should let me train them to help fill the void your adoptive daughter has left behind.”</p><p>“Fine,” Sylvester conceded, draining his glass. After a moment, a wicked smile stretched across his face. “But only if you can convince them.”</p><p>Ferdinand snorted. “You seem sure of yourself.”</p><p>“Only a child like Rozemyne is crazy enough to <em>want</em> to spend time with the Lord of Evil.”</p><p>It was an easy enough bet to win. He had to but pull on Charlotte’s heartstrings, asking her to help the sister who had risked everything to save her, which goaded Wilfried into offering his support so as not to fall behind. Rozemyne was correct - the spirit of competition truly was an amazing motivator. Their training would begin once winter socializing came to an end.</p><p>In the meantime, he met with Elvira to enlist her help with the printing industry. Since he was the one proposing it, he had more control over the timeline, allowing him to protect Rozemyne’s lowercity associates from overwork. He also convinced her to print only a portion of the massive novel she wanted to distribute over winter socializing, instead convincing her to add a few pictures drawn by Wilma with promises of future parts to come to increase interest and keep the momentum flowing while they waited for the printing press in Haldenzel to be established. She seemed far, far too excited about the prospect of including art, but he trusted her with her noble character and top-notch scholarly skills to handle the process.</p><p> </p><p>Every day when feasible, Ferdinand would check on Rozemyne, changing out the feystones when necessary. It felt as though she were filling them up faster than before. Perhaps getting her in the jureve sooner had prevented enough of her mana from hardening to speed up the process a marginal amount. He could only hope so.</p><p>Towards the end of winter, as he was changing out Rozemyne’s feystones, he paused long enough to let the liquid settle and then called out, “Fran?”</p><p>“Yes, High Priest?”</p><p>“Do her clothes not seem tighter than when she was first placed in the potion?”</p><p>Fran leaned over the edge of the tub, scrutinizing her clothing. After a moment, his eyes widened. “Yes, it appears she has grown some.”</p><p>“That shouldn’t be possible.”</p><p>“Is something wrong?” Fran asked, his brows knitting together with worry.</p><p>“No, it’s just… She should be in a half-dead state. Her body shouldn’t be growing.” Was this how the gods planned to keep their word? How was he going to explain this to everyone?</p><p>“She truly is beloved by the gods,” Fran sighed.</p><p>Well, that explanation seemed as good as any.</p><p>He summoned Elvira to come to the temple, and three days later, he showed her into Rozemyne’s hidden room. “Elvira, as you can see, her current attire will not fit her for very long. I ask that you have more made. I don’t know how much she’ll grow or for how long, so we may need to repeat this process several times. The difficulty, of course, is that she cannot be measured as she is, so I must defer to your expertise.”</p><p>She nodded, her noble smile brightening a touch. “My, my, my. She’ll be delighted, won’t she? It was so obvious how much she wanted Charlotte to look up to her. It would have bruised her pride to wake up to find her little sister taller than she was. It’s good to see her doing so well after everything.” After taking out her diptych and writing down a few notes, she said, “Didn’t the Gilberta company have a novel way of making dresses so that they could easily be altered to accommodate growth?”</p><p>“Yes,” Ferdinand nodded. “They’re preparing to alter Rozemyne’s ceremonial robes to fit Charlotte and Wilfried now.”</p><p>“Then I shall place the order with them posthaste.”</p><p>As she prepared to leave, he raised a hand. “Elvira, might I ask a favor of you?”</p><p>Her eyes sparkled as she replied, “But of course. I’d be delighted to help in any way I can.”</p><p>“Rozemyne will have missed at least a year of dearly-needed education when she wakes. While I am more than capable of teaching her all the material needed at the Royal Academy, I know nothing of women’s society, and I could not help but notice how quickly you trained her to demonstrate proper etiquette for her baptism. Can I ask you to continue her noble education once she awakens?”</p><p>She brought a hand to her lips and stared at him for several long moments. Finally, she asked with a troubled smile, “Would Florencia not be the one to handle this as her adoptive mother?”</p><p>One would think, but not only did she not teach Rozemyne to handle noble society in the slightest, she hadn’t prepared the proper clothing expected of a ten-year-old even after it became obvious her measurement would remain largely the same. Whether this was a misunderstanding between Elvira and Florencia regarding who was responsible or something more malicious, he didn’t know nor care. What mattered was preparing her to navigate noble society to the best of their ability. He’d been so focused on having her pass her classes in the first weave that he’d failed to realize how lacking her social education was until it was too late.</p><p>He doubted it would change her direct nature, but hopefully it would save them at least a few headaches.</p><p>“Ordinarily, you’d be correct,” Ferdinand conceded. “However, she would benefit more from a teacher who understood her…unique background.”</p><p>“I see,” she said, dropping her hand as she took on a more serious demeanor. “Very well. I shall ensure she is able to conduct herself with all the grace expected of an archduke candidate. We shall discuss scheduling once she begins to show signs of waking, though might I suggest we plan for me to come to the temple around lunch and train her until fifth bell?”</p><p>What a devious woman, finagling her way into eating Rozemyne’s newest recipes. “Very well, then.”</p><p>With a smile dripping with satisfaction, Elvira gave him a polite bow. “May Dragernuhr’s weaving be swift.”</p>

<p>Over the winter, Charlotte and Wilfried both practiced using mana by filling the foundation with feystones from Rozemyne’s jureve. Therefore, when they came to the temple once socializing was over, neither had any great difficulty offering their mana to the divine instruments. Ferdinand had Charlotte focus on the God of Darkness’ cloak and Ewigeliebe’s sword to help her gain the elements she was missing in the first weave when she got her divine will. He allowed Wilfried to offer his mana to whichever instruments he wanted as he didn’t care about the quality of the boy’s schtappe. He had chosen the sword, spear, and shield, which would likely end up making him an omni-elemental regardless.</p><p>During Spring Prayer, he split Rozemyne’s districts between the children and supplied them with feystones filled with her mana. Fran once again was instrumental in spreading the tale of Saint Charlotte, making her take another step along her road to aub. Both she and Wilfried ended up using slightly fewer potions than in the previous weave, which he attributed to their increased mana control.</p><p>The downside of this was that Wilfried’s unremarkable growth kept fanning the dying kindles of Sylvester’s hope for the boy to succeed him one day. To circumvent this, Ferdinand asked Wilfried during one of their lessons, “How would you like to train with the knights?” It took all of two bells for him to declare his intention to become Knight Commander. Unfortunately for him, that caught Bonifatius’ attention, but that was of no concern to Ferdinand. He’d get used to the grueling training regimen. Probably.</p><p>During this time, he had to arrange for grey priests to be swapped out at Hasse when Charlotte went to perform the Spring Prayer. He had Damuel make arrangements for the soldiers to escort them, but while he should have had Fran handle communications, he went to meet with Gunther himself.</p><p>“High Priest!” Gunther said, giving him a surprised salute before bowing. “It is an honor to speak with you. Might I ask how the High Bishop is doing?”</p><p>“She’s doing well,” Ferdinand said in a low voice. “Her health improves by the day, and she continues to grow. She may soon reach the average size of a girl her age.”</p><p>Gunther’s eyes creased with a warm, bittersweet smile. “Thank you for letting me know. Many of the men were worried when they didn’t see her.”</p><p>From the disgruntled looks, it appeared they did indeed miss her, or her bribes, at least. Far be it from him to break tradition at this point. He handed a small bag of coins to Gunther and said, “On behalf of the High Bishop.”</p><p>“Thank you for your generosity. I hope I can thank her in person soon.”</p><p>With a stiff nod, Ferdinand turned on his heel and walked away. <em>I’m sorry, Gunther. I promise, I’ll bring your family back together again.</em></p><p>
<em>And hopefully, you’ll allow me to be a part of it.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>After Spring Prayer, Ferdinand began training Sylvester’s children in magic, using his tutelage as an excuse to refuse the castle work the aub tried to pile on him. He mostly focused on Charlotte’s growth as Wilfried spent four out of seven days with the knights.</p><p>He gave both of them the prayer for Schutzaria’s Shield to memorize. Charlotte was able to manifest the shield a few days later, though it was barely large enough to cover her, and she could only maintain it for a few minutes or through five strikes.</p><p>After being told about the shields Rozemyne could make, she responded, “Of course, I’ll try to get better, Uncle, but surely you wouldn’t ask me to match a goddess?” That had surprised him. He didn’t know Hartmut was in contact with Charlotte.</p><p>Wilfried struggled with the shield until he saw his sister’s success, and he produced it the next day. He was able to maintain it for longer since he had more experience using his mana, but it was nothing exceptional. Still, it did fend off three of Ferdinand’s strikes, so while it was weaker than his sister’s, it wasn’t completely useless.</p><p>They moved on to dying feystones. He had them practice with small ones at first, thinking if they somehow managed to put in too much, he’d at least get some gold powder out of it. This task didn’t take them long at all given they were so used to using feystones already.</p><p>When he asked Sylvester to provide high quality feystones so they could start practicing creating highbeasts, his brother raised his brows and asked, “Already? Don’t they learn that their first year at the Royal Academy?”</p><p>“I see. I shall stop their training, then. I wonder, though, how the other duchies will react when Rozemyne demonstrates how well-versed she is in producing highbeasts while your and Florencia’s children show just how far behind her they are. Will they assume them less capable, or will they assume you abusive to your adoptive daughter?”</p><p>“...You really are the Lord of Evil. You know Rozemyne only has a highbeast because she’s too weak to walk everywhere, but fine, fine. I’ll get you their feystones. On that note, I’d like you to help with–”</p><p>“As much as I would love to assist you with <em>your</em> work, I’m afraid I’m unable to take on any tasks related to the castle without the High Bishop’s express permission. Furthermore, taking on any additional work would only cause the education of our future archduke candidates to suffer. Of course, if you’re fine with having Wilfried and Charlotte fall so far behind Rozemyne that even the Greater Duchies will wonder why you won’t name her your successor and with impeding the investigation into your adoptive daughter’s kidnapping after your daughter’s by blood was already solved, then–”</p><p>“Alright, alright,” Sylvester sighed, raising a hand to cut him off. “I get your point. Sheesh. I feel like I never get to leave my desk lately…”</p><p>“How unfortunate. It must be so burdensome to have no time for pleasure or rest. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to attend to the duties of the High Bishop, orphanage director, forewoman of the Rozemyne Workshop, liaison to the Plantin Company, head of the printing industry, caretaker of your adoptive daughter, and lead investigator of her kidnapping in addition to my own duties as High Priest.”</p><p>Sylvester blinked at him. “But don’t you like work?”</p><p>Ferdinand rubbed his temples with a sigh. How had he survived before Rozemyne came rampaging into his life?</p><p> </p><p>That summer, Giebe Ilgner purchased Volk with the proceeds from his paper-making workshop, and Bridgette left Rozemyne’s service to prepare for her marriage. Hugo, Rozemyne’s chef, requested permission to marry one of her other chefs, and though he knew she would approve, he couldn’t make that decision for her as they did not belong to him.</p><p>Justus had been helping in the orphanage workshop, and he reported that the Gutenburgs had developed special ink that allowed them to make playing cards out of paper instead of wood, which greatly reduced the cost of production.</p><p>Of course, helping in the workshop was only a small part of his duties. With a bit of prompting, Justus had managed to obtain the names of several of the nobles who’d died when Sylvester killed Georgine in the first weave. He also found that Shikza’s mother had been spreading rumors about Rozemyne’s commoner background, though her husband made an effort to censure her. She’d been silent in recent months after she started visiting with Gerlach’s wife on a semi-regular basis.</p><p>Gerlach himself was being extremely cautious ever since his questioning, but it mattered little. He was already in Ferdinand’s trap. The only reason he still breathed was because of Matthias. Soon, though, Gerlach’s son would no longer be an obstacle.</p><p>Regardless, what Ferdinand needed to do at this point was find a way to get Bonifatius off his back. The man fussed at him every time he went to the castle - which he did as little as possible - wanting to know if he’d caught Gerlach yet. He wanted to yell back, “Do I have the man’s head in my hands? No? Then no, he hasn’t been caught yet, fool.” He instead would ignore him and immediately fly back to the temple. He wasn’t fleeing, however. He was simply choosing to prioritize his work over speaking with Rozemyne’s grandfather.</p><p>It was that summer, too, when the Gutenburgs began working to set up a printing workshop in Haldenzel. This time, rather than have them travel for days by carriage and spend longer going from location to location to individually train workers, he helped Benno arrange for those who would be involved in the printing industry to come to Ehrenfest to be trained. Benno and Lutz, his successor, still had to go to Haldenzel to establish the required guilds, but the work seemed to progress at roughly the same speed with half the headaches as before. By autumn, Elvira was preparing the first volume of <em>Royal Academy Love Stories</em> to be printed the following season.</p><p>Throughout all this, Rozemyne continued to grow, necessitating multiple changes of clothes, which her attendants had to handle without removing her from the jureve. She also filled feystones with mana at an alarming rate. Ferdinand could not go even a day without having Fran change them out. Traveling back to the temple every night during the Harvest Festival was going to be a nightmare. There was no way he could avoid relying on potions, and thinking about the complaints Rozemyne would throw at him once she awoke was already giving him a headache. Really, who did she think he was drinking them for?</p><p>Regardless, even though he’d seen it before, he couldn’t believe the amount of mana she had packed in that tiny body of hers. Was it Ewigeliebe’s favor that kept her alive this long?</p><p>Well, he had granted her his protection in the first weave. Perhaps her single-minded obsession with books had resonated with him.</p><p>Sometime before the Harvest Festival, Ferdinand went to check on Rozemyne only to discover Egmont harassing her retainers. <em>Ah, I’d forgotten about this insect. Perhaps I should have let Rozemyne put his head on a pike.</em> Well, he’d provide valuable evidence later, so it was worth keeping him alive for now.</p><p>He, of course, had wanted a new attendant as he with his infinitesimal mana capacity had managed to impregnate another grey shrine maiden. Once again, Ferdinand delighted in sending him away until he made an appointment like a proper blue priest should, this time with a reminder of what happened to insects who disrespected High Bishops, daughters of archdukes, and High Priests with very little patience for incompetent imbeciles.</p><p>Ferdinand would have pushed back the date of their meeting by several days, but Rozemyne wouldn’t want the grey shrine maiden to suffer, so he had Egmont select his new - and willing - flower three days later. Having learned from his previous error, Ferdinand immediately contacted the Plantin Company to enlist their help with the delivery. Tuuli was once again instrumental in ensuring things went smoothly. Her presence throughout the girl’s pregnancy up until her departure to Hasse’s orphanage the following spring gave everyone involved peace of mind. While everyone attended to the heavily pregnant shrine maiden, Ferdinand met with Gunther once again to give him news of Rozemyne’s recovery and pass him the extra funds she always prepared for the soldiers. He also thanked Tuuli for her help, though he wondered why he even bothered after she stared at him with her mouth agape before stammering out some semblance of gratitude.</p><p>Once again, Ferdinand had Charlotte and Wilfried perform Spring Prayer with Rozemyne’s mana, taking the same districts they had the year before. This time, they each had their own set of blue ceremonial robes, each embroidered with Ehrenfest’s crest. At Ferdinand’s insistence, they ordered them through the Gilberta Company since they closely guarded the secret behind making clothes that could be easily altered to accommodate future growth.</p><p>Watching them leave, he wondered if he shouldn’t enlist that zealot’s help with these ceremonies. He certainly had the mana for it, and his devotion to Rozemyne made him so very easy to manipulate. Ottilie and Leberecht would likely object, but he could leave the convincing of them to their son. Such basic manipulation should come naturally to an archscholar of his caliber.</p><p>He decided to hold off until after Rozemyne took him as a retainer. After all, he wouldn’t want to make her feel as though he were forcing the fanatic onto her. Better she realize she did it to herself than be able to blame Ferdinand for her suffering.</p><p>That night, as Fran reached into the jureve to retrieve the filled feystones, Ferdinand stopped him. They both stared into the potion as its surface settled and then gasped at the same time. Her fingers were twitching.</p><p>“High Priest, is this…?” Fran asked, his voice wavering.</p><p>“Yes,” Ferdinand said, dumbfounded. “She’s starting to wake.”</p>

<p>Ferdinand immediately sent word to the Plantin Company to inform them, and by extension her family, of the change in Rozemyne’s condition. He also sent a request to the Gilberta Company to create a hairpin in the divine color of spring. Receiving a gift from Tuuli was sure to lighten Rozemyne’s spirits after discovering she’d been asleep for over a year. After that, he contacted Elvira, who agreed to come to the temple in three days. Then, he began the grueling task of performing Spring Prayer while returning to the temple every single day.</p><p>A couple of days later, Fran presented him with a letter that had been passed to Gil by Lutz. He took it into his hidden room that evening where he was free to complain about the crude penmanship that he barely managed to decipher. Tuuli’s effusive reply was acceptable, but Effa’s was nigh unreadable. Eventually, he managed to tease out from the haphazard scrawling that she was deeply concerned about Rozemyne’s condition and grateful for his part in protecting her and helping her heal. Gunther asked him to keep protecting her in the noble district as he protected her at the gates. A warm feeling spread through his chest, and part of him wondered what he’d done to earn this letter in this weave so that he could do it again.</p><p>Even after he put the letter away, he wasn’t able to remove the smile on his face. Since he couldn’t allow others to see him in such a shameless state, he turned to the pile of materials the gods had carelessly dumped in the middle of his workshop. He’d been far too busy the past year to address it.</p><p>As he began sorting and putting them away, he came across something that immediately wiped the smile from his face.</p><p>Rozemyne’s feystone.</p><p>“Mestionora, you cruel, vindictive goddess.” In what world did this count as a <em>material</em> he’d gathered? Did she just enjoy inflicting pain on him, or was this a warning?</p><p>Either way, he needed to decide what to do with it. He both wanted to treat it with reverence and never see it again. There certainly wasn’t any way he was going to incorporate it into a magic tool, not when merely looking at it made him feel the way her body had dissolved in his arms after he’d failed her.</p><p>Eventually, he decided to keep it hidden away in an ornate silver box tucked away on a high shelf in his workshop. In a few years, maybe he’d find a use for it, but until then, she could watch over him from there.</p><p>Elvira came the next day, along with her personal seamstress and Corinna from the Gilberta Company. Once they got Rozemyne’s measurements, they launched into discussions about what to do for her clothes. She’d grown a significant amount over the past year, and apparently, letting out the hems of her dresses would not suffice.</p><p>Remembering this similar dilemma from the previous weave, Ferdinand asked, “Can you not simply add some extra fabric to the skirt and sleeves?”</p><p>The women exchanged looks before Elvira stepped forward and said, “If she had only grown a little taller, perhaps. However, she is much changed from when she first went in the jureve.” As she and the seamstresses discussed possibly borrowing and altering the dresses of a daughter of a Liesegang archnoble, Ferdinand peered into the soaking tub to see what she meant. His attention was immediately drawn, however, to her blinking eyes.</p><p>“You may need to hasten your plans,” he said. “She may wake within the next few days.” As glad as that made him, he couldn’t help but sigh. She <em>would</em> pick the most inconvenient time to come out of her jureve.</p><p>“My, my, my,” Elvira gasped, equal parts delighted and troubled. “Then I shall depart for the castle to speak with her retainers. Shall I leave her wardrobe to Florencia and stand vigil while you complete your duties for Spring Prayer?”</p><p>That wouldn’t do at all. He couldn’t have anyone else in this room without him, nor was he willing to move her. He would simply have to push through somehow.</p><p>“Oh, my, Lord Ferdinand, could it be you’re planning to rely on potions to both watch over Rozemyne and attend to Spring Prayer?” Elvira asked, an amused twinkle in her eye.</p><p>“…I promised her I’d be here when she woke.”</p><p>The way her eyes sparkled at that unsettled him. “My, my, my, we can’t have you breaking a promise like that. Hmm… I seem to recall my husband telling me of an exasperating blue priest that attended Spring Prayer with you shortly before my daughter was baptized. Perhaps he can assist again, at least for a few days until Rozemyne awakens.”</p><p>Ferdinand tapped his temple as a headache began blooming at the back of his skull. If he made that request of Sylvester now, he’d have mountains of work dumped on him in exchange, which would keep him away from Rozemyne, defeating the purpose.</p><p>Once again, Elvira’s uncanny intuition stepped in to save him. “I’ll speak with Florencia to get her thoughts. I’m sure between the two of us, we’ll have a solution before dinner. If you’ll excuse me.”</p><p>Sure enough, an ordonnanz alighted on his arm just before sixth bell, stating a visiting blue priest would stop by in the morning to offer his assistance in this time of need. Sylvester and Karstedt arrived along side Wilfried and Charlotte the next day. Both of the children were beaming with joy, but Wilfried was practically glowing. He was so excited to be working with his father, even if they were going to separate districts.</p><p>“Thank you for coming, Sylvester.”</p><p>“Yeah, no problem,” he shrugged. “Florencia told me everything. So any day now, huh?”</p><p>“It’ll likely be at least a week, but…”</p><p>Sylvester sighed and scratched the back of his head. “But you want to be here just in case. I get it. We’re all anxious to see her again. Right, kids?”</p><p>“Yeah!” Wilfied said. “She protected me and Charlotte. Now, I’m going to protect her!” He held up a curled arm and slapped his bicep, trying to show off the strength he earned from a year training under Bonifatius. “That’s what knights do, after all!”</p><p>Sylvester grimaced at that but quickly schooled his features as he patted his son on the head.</p><p>Charlotte clenched her folded hands in front of her chest and said, “I’ve been waiting all this time to apologize to her. If I hadn’t gotten kidnapped… If my knights had been able to protect me…”</p><p>“Charlotte,” Ferdinand interrupted her, “we’ve talked about this. There’s no point wasting energy on regretting the past.”</p><p>“‘It’s better spent preparing for the future.’ Yes, I know.”</p><p>“If you know, then stop thinking about if’s and instead focus on your duties for the day.” With that, he provided a map of districts Sylvester would need to visit to Karstedt and sent them all on their way before heading back into the hidden room, bringing his paperwork with him. Once he finished that stack, he took it to Zahm to have either filed or delegated if there was any math that needed to be completed before grabbing another armful.</p><p>He repeated this until late into the evening, only stopping for meals after Zahm threatened to report his eating habits to Rozemyne. He allowed himself a short rest inside the hidden room before repeating the process the next day. This continued for five more days until at last, she began to rise from the potion.</p><p>Ferdinand reached into the liquid and pulled her up. When she began to flounder, he patted her back to knock the rest of the jureve out of her lungs, only for her to complain at him again. This girl…</p><p>He lifted her out of the tub, laid her down on her bench to examine her, then froze. Her wet clothes were clinging to her, revealing the modest signs of early puberty. Before he could think, he covered her mouth and nose and cast waschen on her.</p><p>“What the heck, Ferdinand?!” she spluttered. “A little warning next time! Oh, hey, I’m dry! Oh! OH! I’m… I’m bigger!” Her eyes widened first with surprise then fear. “Ferdinand, how long have I been asleep?”</p><p>“A year,” he said, coming close enough for her to grab his sleeve if she wanted. “We’re wrapping up Spring Prayer right now.”</p><p>“A year?! But you said it’d be a season at most!”</p><p>“That was before you got poisoned.”</p><p>“Ngh…! That grey-eyed man!”</p><p>Ferdinand froze as he processed that. “You remember the face of your kidnapper?” he asked. Why hadn’t she said that before?</p><p>“No, just his eyes and voice. They were…” A shudder ran through her, and she looked away. “You caught him, though, right?”</p><p>It was his turn to look away.</p><p>“You… You didn’t? Is Charlotte safe? Will I be safe? What happened?” she asked, tugging his sleeve.</p><p>He placed a hand over hers and said, “Charlotte’s safe. Your guard knights rescued her. You’re safe, too. I’ve laid a trap for the one responsible, but…” He squeezed his eyes shut and admitted through clenched teeth, “I’m trying to save as many lives as possible. Joisontak, Charlotte’s kidnapper, confessed that night, and his entire family was executed. I… I did not think you would want children too young to attend the Royal Academy executed along with your kidnapper, even if it defies common sense.”</p><p>With great difficulty, she brought her other hand over his and began to gently pat it. “That must have been hard for you. You did a good job. Thank you.”</p><p>What was this warm feeling in his chest? He wasn’t sure he liked it.</p><p>“Hush so I can examine you.” Touching her wrist and neck, he confirmed all her mana clumps were gone. The gods had thus technically kept their end of the bargain.</p><p>“Am I healthy now? Am I a normal girl?”</p><p>“You have not nor will you ever be normal.”</p><p>“I don’t want to hear that from you!”</p><p>“Then you can hear it from anyone else who has met you. They will tell you the same.”</p><p>“You’re so mean, Ferdinand!”</p><p>He smirked at her and then said, “All your mana clumps are gone. You are indeed healthy. For the most part. You did spend a year asleep. On that note, how is your movement? How about your mana flow? How does it compare to before? If you could give that in a percentage, that would be appreciated. Are there any significant changes after increasing the size of your vessel?”</p><p>Rozemyne grimaced at him and said he was in [%#^+ $&amp;=#%] mode, whatever that was. She’d called him that before on more than one occasion, but she’d yet to explain it. Regardless of what it meant, he knew it was an insult. Tapping his temple, he made plans to observe her over the coming days to ascertain the answers to his questions and compare them to the previous weave. How, though, could he differentiate between effects caused by sleeping for one year less and those caused by divine intervention?</p><p>“Ferdinand,” Rozemyne called him, “tell me what I missed.”</p><p>“Before that, are you able to sit up on your own?”</p><p>While she could move a bit better than last time, she still didn’t have the strength to push herself up. He grabbed the enhancement magic tools he’d kept nearby and placed one on each arm, explaining that her attendants would have to put on the ones for her legs since they required skin contact. “They can handle that after your bath. I had one drawn when I noticed you were about to wake.” He went to call on her attendants but paused. “They have been eager for you to wake, Rozemyne.”</p><p>When they came rushing in, he handed her to Fran to be bathed and changed, only for her to grab the front of his robes with the same anxious face she’d had before. He thought he’d done enough to ease her worries this time.</p><p>He knew somewhat how she felt; seeing a grown Rozemyne when a year before she barely looked old enough to enter the Royal Academy had greatly disoriented him. She, however, was the only one who had changed, making it easier for him to adjust. For her, the entire world had left her behind.</p><p>Once again, he covered her hand with his and said, “There is nothing to be afraid of. Remember, they have been eager for you to wake.”</p><p>With a shaky nod, she released him and allowed herself to be carried away. He returned to his chambers to get changed and send out ordonannzes to Sylvester, Bonifatius, and Elvira before composing a letter to the Plantin Company that he would send with Gil later.</p><p>When he entered Rozemyne’s chambers, he found her sitting at her table, staring at her hands as she clenched and unclenched them, a cup of forgotten tea before her. She looked up when she heard him approach, and he froze.</p><p>Oh, this wouldn’t do at all.</p><p>He hadn’t noticed until he saw her properly dressed, but her looks matched her physical age, making her appear to be a child recently returned from her first term at the academy. They could easily pass that off as her being an early bloomer if anyone else made note of it, but more concerning was how much more mature she appeared than when she went in the jureve. While obviously still a child, some of her future ethereal beauty was already peeking through, and that was sure to attract insects that had dismissed her in the previous weave.</p><p>Good gods, if it weren’t for her high mana capacity, she’d turn the academy upside down when her mana sensing developed… which looked like it could occur within the next couple of years. If royalty discovered they could sense her, she’d be snatched away in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“Oh, it looks like Ferdinand is having a processing error.”</p><p>Well, maybe if she opened her mouth first, she’d shoo them away herself.</p><p>He sat with her and discussed the changes she had missed as well as the current state of the investigation. “Therefore, it will be imperative that you monitor children of the Former Veronica Faction this winter to determine if you can win any over to our side. While children are included in the faction of their parents and cannot choose their own until they come of age, there are some ways of…circumventing that issue. It would require them to leave their families, but…”</p><p>Rozemyne nodded, her sad eyes contrasting her noble smile. “But it’s better than dying.”</p><p>A somber mood fell over them for a moment before Ferdinand passed a box over to her. When he nodded at her questioning look, she opened it and gasped, a bright smile lighting up her face.</p><p>She gently removed the hair stick and sighed, “Is there anyone better than my personal hair stick craftswoman? She truly is an angel. She’s improved so much!” She quickly had one of her attendants slide it into place for her and then turned her head. “How does it look?”</p><p>It was a stunning piece with light blue and mint green spring flowers trimmed in warm gold surrounded by deep red seasonal fruits and vibrant green leaves and white bobbles like dew drops cascading down her night blue hair. He didn’t fail to notice how the flowers matched his own hair color. Perhaps it was a small show of gratitude towards him from Tuuli. Regardless, it pleased him to be included in something shared between her family.</p><p>“It’s beautiful.”</p><p>“Right? My craftswoman is the best!”</p><p>“Indeed. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have matters with Spring Prayer to attend to. I’m sure your attendants have many updates for you as well. Fran, perhaps you can start by showing her the new books that Gil brought for her.”</p><p>“New books?!”</p><p>As Rozemyne’s attention snapped to Fran, Ferdinand beat a hasty retreat. That unguarded expression combined with her older appearance was utterly indecent, and he wasn’t confident even Elvira could train her to hide her emotions well enough not to attract the wrong kind of attention. He was going to have to speed up the time table with her, and he wasn’t prepared at all. He needed to plan.</p>

<p>It was decided that Rozemyne would return to the castle in three days and that Elvira would begin tutoring her the following week. Damuel returned to the temple the next day to start guarding her again, and when he saw her, he froze in place. It took several moments before he gathered himself enough to kneel to her and say, “I am so glad to see you well, Lady Rozemyne.”</p><p>“I thank you ever so much, Damuel,” she replied. “You seem to have trained hard since I last saw you.”</p><p>“Yes,” he said, a distant look in his eye. “Lord Bonifatius has taken it upon himself to train all of the knights guarding the archduke family. It’s been…an experience.”</p><p>Ferdinand excused himself to allow them to catch up with each other before her harspiel practice began. At third bell, she and her entourage came to his office to help with paperwork. He allowed her to work through the temple finances in order to refresh her math skills and not at all to use her as a calculator.</p><p>They ate lunch together for the first time in over a year where he tried to tease out answers to his burning research questions without putting her on alert. After they finished their meal, he started training her to use her mana now that her lack of blockages utterly decimated her control. With quantities as high as hers, that was dangerous not only for herself but for everyone near her.</p><p>He started by having her practice putting her mana into small feystones. He let her go through a dozen, scooping the resulting gold powder into a bag, before telling her to remove the enhancement bracelet from one of her arms. Another fifteen feystones exploded before she was able to fill one without breaking it. Once she was able to successfully add and remove her mana from a feystone ten times in a row, he had her dust the remaining shards of the failures.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Ferdinand,” she said. “I didn’t mean to break so many of your precious feystones.”</p><p>“Do not worry,” he replied, grinning as he gathered the last of the gold dust into his leather sack. “This is quite a valuable material.”</p><p>“[%#^+ $&amp;=#%].”</p><p>There was that phrase again. He pinched her cheeks, frowning at how less pliable they were now that she no longer appeared to be around seven years old. Still, it was pleasurable enough squeezing them to relieve some of his annoyance. Once he’d had his fill, he healed her and handed her several boards with history and geography notes. “Memorize these.”</p><p>“Ngh, all these names are so long and hard…”</p><p>“Perhaps you can make a picture book about this content to help those in the winter playroom learn it faster.”</p><p>“Understood! I’ll memorize every last one! Ehehehe!”</p><p>Shameless. No one besides her husband should ever see such a look on her face. He shot a glare at Damuel and all the male attendants in the room, who quickly averted their gazes. Elvira’s training couldn’t come soon enough…</p><p>Each day they spent in the temple, he added more protective charms to her collection, instructing her on how to put them on and warning her not to tell anyone how many she had nor where they were. There were some her attendants would have to put on her, but there were several more he specifically instructed her to put on herself.</p><p>By the time they departed for the castle, she ended up with five more than she’d had in the previous weave when she started at the Royal Academy. With the excess mana she had access to, however, they would only serve to help her keep herself under control.</p><p>Rozemyne met him at the noble gate, and he looked her over with a nod. She was still a little uncertain on her feet, given the extreme height difference, but she’d improved greatly over the past three days. Still, that effort alone wasn’t enough to keep her safe. “Remember that you’re reliant on enhancement magic to move. Do not overexert yourself. Also, remember that you actually look your age now. Social missteps and blundering antics will no longer be excused as they were before. You’re expected to conduct yourself with the dignity and grace of a nine-year-old. It would be better for you to no longer rely on your highbeast, but given the circumstances, it can’t be avoided. Make sure not to leave the sight of your guard knights. Furthermore…” He trailed off as he noticed her shoulders slumping more and more with each word. This fool! How could she be so open with her emotions? Did she not realize how many weaknesses she already had to be exploited? “Just…remember how glad everyone is that you woke up safely.”</p><p>“Right,” she said, giving him a small smile.</p><p>They each formed their highbeats, and after Ferdinand had mounted his, he heard a loud, “Bwuh?!” behind him. He looked back and found Rozemyne rubbing her forehead.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>“I didn’t realize how much taller I’ve gotten, so when I made my pandabus like I always do, I ended up hitting my head on the roof.”</p><p>Of course she did. Ferdinand sighed and rubbed his temples.</p><p>Eventually, they made it to the castle.</p><p>Angelica and Cornelius were kneeling in wait, but when they saw their mistress, their eyes widened, and their jaws dropped. It took a loud cough from Ferdinand for them to return to their noble countenance. Both of them offered apologies for their failure to protect her, but she dismissed them, instead saying they’d obeyed her orders and thus performed their duties flawlessly.</p><p>Once Norbert finished having the servants unload Rozemyne’s ungodly highbeast, she and Ferdinand parted ways. He arrived at his chambers to find Justus and Eckhart waiting for him, the latter asking permission to leave early to prepare for the celebratory dinner that night. Justus, unsurprisingly, peppered him with dozens of questions as he helped him change, but he either deflected or ignored most of them. Eckhart seemed just as curious but held his peace since he would see her later himself.</p><p>Eventually, Rozemyne arrived at his office, and Justus nearly jumped off the wall in his excitement to start questioning her. Ferdinand was eventually forced to toss him out of the room, keeping only Rozemyne’s attendants present. It wasn’t ideal, but he only planned to continue their tutoring session, not serve tea. As they moved from geography to discussing rankings and how the Royal Academy affected them, she said, “I thought the Royal Academy was only for children. You certainly know a lot about it, though, don’t you?”</p><p>“You’re the one who instructed the students to gather information, are you not? Damuel organized their findings into a report and paid them each a flat fee. You are to offer any extra pay based on the value of the information obtained.”</p><p>“Oh!” she said, clapping her hands. “That’s right! How many new stories did they gather?”</p><p>“None. They gathered information, not fanciful tales.”</p><p>She started to pout, but when she saw the look on his face, she quickly schooled her features and covered her cheeks. “I see. I will have to be more precise with my instructions in the future. Will it be fine to take my time reviewing the information and offer payment in the winter?”</p><p>“Yes, that would be ideal,” Ferdinand agreed. “Speaking of winter, you will be expected to select retainers in the playroom this year. Wilfried has already acquired several, so you will mostly be competing with Charlotte. Rihyarda should have a list of students for you to choose from. I suggest reviewing it over the coming months so you will know who to consider and who to avoid.”</p><p>“Hmm… Am I limited to just the people on that list? There’s someone in the Former Veronica Faction I would like to have, too.”</p><p>“Oh? And who would that be?”</p><p>“Roderick. He gave me so many good stories, and he was even able to fill in gaps for ones he couldn’t fully remember. I think I could grow him into a wonderful writer!”</p><p>Ah, he hadn’t realized the boy had caught her eye so early on. “That one might be difficult,” he sighed. “Roderick was the one who tricked Wilfried into entering the White Tower.”</p><p>Rozemyne tilted her head and placed a hand on her cheek. “But didn’t we give Wilfried a second chance after the incident? Isn’t it possible he was just doing as his parents told him without knowing the full implications?”</p><p>“Hmm…” Ferdinand tapped his temple as he recalled exactly how he had come to be in her service. As he recalled, Roderick had wanted to be her retainer from the beginning and asked to give her his name as early as their second year in the academy. After the White Tower incident, his parents had started neglecting and abusing him, so he was eager to leave their house and come under Rozemyne’s guardianship. As a mednoble, he had a bit more mana than the average laynoble, but he doubted even dedicated assistance from Hartmut could get the boy to brew a high-quality name stone in his first year at the academy. It would be another three at least before that could happen. Still, name swearing wasn’t the only solution to this problem. “This may be a valuable learning experience for you. Alright, then, Rozemyne. You are to find a way to prove his trustworthiness, win him to your side, and separate him from his parents. Know that, however, this will isolate him not only from his family and friends in the Former Veronica Faction but also leave him adrift among your retainers since he won’t be a part of the Florencia Faction, either. If you truly want him, it will be your job to find a way to safely integrate him into your service and ensure all your retainers can work together peaceably, regardless of how they feel about each other.” As he knew all too well with Justus and Eckhart…</p><p>Rozemyne’s eyes wavered for a moment before she looked down with a nod. “Very well. If he wants to leave his family, then I’ll help him. I won’t forcibly tear him away from his parents, though.”</p><p>A pang of discomfort shot through him, but he pushed it aside. It would do no good to offer her empty words of comfort when what she wanted was to be held, and he could not do that here under the scrutiny of her retainers. Even once they were back at the temple, he might be able to bring her into his hidden room once or twice, but no one would turn a blind eye to it for long now that she looked her age.</p><p>In the end, the only thing he could do for her right now was prepare her the best he could for the turbulent future she faced.</p><p>They continued reviewing the material she’d missed over the past year until Rihyarda came to retrieve her to prepare for dinner.</p><p> </p><p>Ferdinand went to the dining hall where he found the archducal couple, Bonifatius, and the Linkbergs already waiting. Wilfried and Charlotte were due to come soon.</p><p>“Ferdinand!” Sylvester called out, waving him over. “How is she?”</p><p>“She’s my granddaughter!” Bonifatius boomed. “Of course she’s well! Right?”</p><p>With a reluctant nod, he answered, “Yes, the jureve did what it was supposed to. She’s fully recovered in that regard. However…”</p><p>“What? What is it? What’s wrong with my granddaughter?!”</p><p>“Nothing’s wrong. Everything is fine. <em>Too</em> fine if you ask me. Sylvester, you, Karstedt, and I will need to meet directly after dinner.”</p><p>Sylvester cocked his head to the side while Bonifatius raged about being excluded. “What about?”</p><p>“...You’ll see when she arrives.”</p><p>And see he did. His eyes nearly fell from his head when she entered the room. Everyone took a collective gasp, save Ferdinand and Elvira, though her face lit up with a proud smile when she saw her daughter.</p><p>Wilfried and Charlotte recovered first, rushing forward to greet their sister. Shockingly, Rozemyne was actually a little taller than Wilfried, though he’d likely surpass her before they started at the academy. “You’re so tall now!” he gasped.</p><p>“And beautiful!” Charlotte said.</p><p>Rozemyne’s cheeks flushed as she smiled at her siblings. “Oh, no, it’s you who has gotten more beautiful, my adorable little sister!”</p><p>“Hey, Rozemyne, Rozemyne,” Wilfried said, grabbing for her attention. “I trained really hard with Uncle Bonifatius so that I can protect you! I’m going to be Knight Commander, so I’ll always be able to protect you and Charlotte.”</p><p>“Knight Commander…?” She shot a glance to Sylvester, who gave a defeated nod. “Um, I look forward to seeing how much you’ve improved, then.”</p><p>“Sister, I’ve worked even harder than Wilfried! I wish to protect you, too!”</p><p>“What? No! I’m your older sister! I’m going to protect you!”</p><p>“Oh, my!” Charlotte giggled. “Perhaps we can protect each other, then.”</p><p>Rozemyne nodded and said, “Very well, then. It’s a promise.” Ferdinand walked over and placed a hand on her shoulder, bringing her attention away from her siblings and redirecting it to the adults in the room. After taking a deep breath, she straightened her back and approached the archducal couple.</p><p>Once she bowed and offered her apologies for any worry she might have caused, Sylvester ordered her to stand before he and Florencia both knelt, causing a stir to run through those gathered, save Ferdinand who’d seen this before.</p><p>Sylvester took her hands, pressed his forehead against them, and said, “I’m saying this not as the archduke, but as a father. Thank you for saving my children. Thank you.”</p><p>Rozemyne looked to Ferdinand for help, but he directed her gaze back to the couple. That was when Florencia said, “You have my utmost gratitude. To me, you are more than the Saint of Ehrenfest. In my eyes, you are my savior–the saint of my family.”</p><p>The girl was frozen in terror, her eyes screaming, “No, don’t thank me! I went on an irresponsible rampage!” so loudly that it practically echoed throughout the chamber. Eventually, Karstedt brought the moving moment to an end, and introductions continued. When she presented Bonifatius with a piece of paper folded into that same strange shape from before, she explained that it was a heart that symbolized love and brought her fingers and thumbs together in a similar shape with a disarming smile.</p><p>Ferdinand wondered if they were going to have to prepare a funeral for Bonifatius.</p><p>She went on to explain it was a letter and opened it for him, only for him to frown. Once Elvira stepped in to assure her that the letter was acceptable, she prompted Rozemyne to return it to its original shape, which placated Bonifatius.</p><p>Once she returned the note, Wilfried jumped in. “So you can make shapes like that out of paper? Are there any others you can make?”</p><p>“Oh, yes! I can make a [&amp;$^#], a box, a [@#^@], which is a type of bird, flowers, talfrosches, and boats. I can show you how to make them if you purchase some paper.”</p><p>“What about a sword? Or a shield?”</p><p>“Umm… Maybe? I’d have to play around with it and see.”</p><p>“Can you write me a letter, too?” Charlotte asked. “That heart was so adorable!”</p><p>“Children,” Florencia said, placing a hand on each of their shoulders, “I know you’re excited, but Rozemyne still has yet to greet her parents.”</p><p>“Oh, right. Sorry, Rozemyne.”</p><p>“I apologize, Sister.”</p><p>She nodded to them and turned back to Bonifatius, requesting he teach her enhancement magic.</p><p>“What?” Wilfried blurted. “Do you want to die? I know you’re healthy now, but his training is no joke!”</p><p>Bonifatius waved him off with a guffaw. “Fear not, Rozemyne! I’ll make you the strongest person in all of Ehrenfest!”</p><p>“Oh, but I don’t want to be the strongest,” she said quickly. “I wish to be capable of moving without the assistance of magical tools. Rihyarda assures me that no one knows more about enhancement magic than you, so it was my hope that you could share your knowledge with me.”</p><p>“Capable..of moving…?” he stammered. “Is…Is it really safe for you to train at all?”</p><p>“I simply ask that you do not work me to death.”</p><p>“Right, but how does one train someone to move who cannot move?”</p><p>“Um… That’s quite the philosophical question, Grandfather.”</p><p>Good gods, he’d forgotten how dense the two of them together could be. “Bonifatius, simply have her remove the magic tool from one of her arms and teach her to focus on enhancing that one arm alone. You can then move on from there.”</p><p>“Excellent idea, Ferdinand!” he bellowed. “Right! Rozemyne, I’ll teach you to move one limb at a time!”</p><p>“I thank you ever so much, Grandfather.”</p><p>She finished her greetings to her baptismal family, each of whom expressed their great pleasure at seeing her again, and then they sat down to eat.</p><p>During dinner, everyone gave Rozemyne updates from their perspectives. Wilfried and Charlotte discussed the past two winter playrooms,their work assisting with religious ceremonies, and studying under Ferdinand; Florencia explained the current status of each of the factions along with current trends; Elvira told her about the state of the printing industry in Ehrenfest and Haldenzel; and the Linkberg men detailed the grueling training Bonifatius was putting the archducal knights through.</p><p>“I see,” Rozemyne said. “Perhaps we should consider giving Wilfried’s guard knights my mana compression method as well so they can benefit as much as the rest.”</p><p>As his knights gasped in excited awe, Ferdinand asked, “And Wilfried himself?”</p><p>The boy’s eyes lit up as he gave her a pleading look. She tilted her head and said, “Well, he’ll need to learn how to compress mana at the Royal Academy first, right? I can hold a seminar after we return from our first term, and he can learn it then.”</p><p>“That would be wise if you wish to give him a chance as soon as possible. Wilfried, as a leader of men and a future knight, you must continue to think before you act.”</p><p>“Understood, Uncle,” he nodded, determination steeling his gaze.</p><p> </p><p>After dinner, Ferdinand, Sylvester, and Karstedt gathered in the aub’s office, sending out their attendants after they poured their first glasses of vize and erecting a sound barrier.</p><p>“Just what happened to her in that jureve?” Sylvester asked, holding his head in his hands after downing his entire goblet in one shot.</p><p>“It seems she was blessed by the gods,” Ferdinand shrugged, pouring another glass for his brother. At the incredulous looks he received, he answered, “I’m not speaking facetiously. The body enters a half-dead state when submerged in a jureve. She should not have been able to grow at all.”</p><p>Karstedt shook his head and muttered, “So she would have still looked like a young child when she entered the Royal Academy?”</p><p>“Most likely.”</p><p>“That would have caused some headaches, but it would have saved us from the onslaught of proposals we’ll get her first day there. Gods, even thinking about what that Archduke Conference will be like is giving me a stomach ache.” The second glass went down his throat as fast as the first. Ferdinand would let him refill it himself this time.</p><p>“The situation is far worse than that,” Ferdinand warned. “She already had an abnormally high mana capacity before entering the jureve. Without those blockages impeding her, it’s effectively half again higher.”</p><p>They both stared at him, mouths agape.</p><p>“With her vessel growing, it only stands to reason her capacity will as well. We won’t be able to hide her from the Sovereignty for long. We need to tie her down to Ehrenfest before one of those princes discovers her.”</p><p>Sylvester fell into thought and eventually said, “In terms of mana capacity and the ability to control her, wouldn’t you be the best match for her, Ferdinand?”</p><p>Ferdinand kept his face neutral as he grinned on the inside. “If you were to engage her to me, we’d need to make moves to ensure the Liesegangs don’t rally behind me as the next aub.”</p><p>“Oh?” Karstedt said, raising a brow. “You’re not objecting? You were so adamant about not marrying her before.”</p><p>“We don’t have many options at this point, and it’s true no one else can match her.” He paused to take a sip of vize and then eyed Karstedt. “Do you think Elvira could keep the Liesegangs contained?”</p><p>“For a short time, certainly,” he said. “However, she won’t be able to suppress the current head for long.”</p><p>Sylvester leaned forward. “What are you thinking?”</p><p>“First, appoint Elvira as Rozemyne’s scholar. She has been the acting head of the printing industry for a year now, and having a Liesegang archnoble serving the archduke family should help placate them for now. Then, get the king’s permission at this year’s Archduke Conference for us to be engaged but wait to announce it in Ehrenfest until after Rozemyne returns from her first year at the Royal Academy. That should give me enough time to select a replacement High Priest, though we can expect it to take at least three years to complete a handoff given everything that occurs in the temple now. I can then return to being Knight Commander. Once Karstedt retires and Wilfried comes of age, he can take the post of Vice Commander until either Charlotte or Melchior is confirmed as the next aub. I’ll step down at that point and have Wilfried take my role.”</p><p>“And you think that’ll be enough to convince them that you won’t be the next aub?” he asked.</p><p>“If we announce my intention to return to the Knight’s Order at the same time we announce the engagement, then it should buy us enough time until you decide on your heir. Charlotte is already improving at a rapid pace. If she continues on this trajectory, we might be able to have an archduke candidate from a higher-ranking duchy marry her. If not, we could engage Melchior to a Liesegang archnoble.”</p><p>Sylvester scoffed. “And which higher-ranked duchy would send one of their candidates to Ehrenfest?”</p><p>Ferdinand tapped his temple and replied, “I still have some connections in Dunklefelger and Drewanchel. Once they see the innovations Rozemyne has introduced to our duchy, they’ll want to make strong connections with us. We can likely arrange something with the son of a second or third wife at the very least.” At worst, he could convince Charlotte to propose to the son of Aub Dunklefelger’s second wife at knifepoint.</p><p>“I do not anticipate this will be enough to soothe the ire of the Liesegangs,” he continued. “Most your and Wilfried’s retainers are from the Former Veronica Faction or neutrals, are they not? Replace your incompetent aides with Liesegang archnobles. That should have the added benefit of reducing your workload considerably.”</p><p>Holding his chin, Sylvester murmured, “Hmmm… As much as I don’t like to admit it, you might be right here. We don’t have very many of them in our entourage. I’ll have to speak with Florencia about Wilfred’s attendants and see which of mine I should cut.”</p><p>“While I agree that’s a good idea,” Karstedt said, “I have to ask - will Rozemyne be okay with this? Wasn’t she vehement about not marrying you?”</p><p>Ferdinand waved off the question. “That won’t be an issue.”</p><p>“What?” he balked. “I’m not sure I want to hand my daughter over to someone so dismissive of her wishes.”</p><p>“I’m not being dismissive. I simply know what she wants, and I’m in a position to give it to her.”</p><p>“You know, I know you’re talking about books, but the way you phrased that really makes me want to keep you as far away from my adoptive daughter as possible.”</p><p>Ferdinand glared at Sylvester, who only laughed in response.</p>

<p>After getting approval from Sylvester, Ferdinand sent Lasfam an ordonnanz informing him that he would bring Rozemyne, Charlotte, and Wilfried to his estate in three days for tutoring. It would be their last session before he and Rozemyne returned to the temple. In the meantime, Sylvester formally appointed Elvira to be Rozemyne’s scholar, and he’d identified three of his retainers to remove, though he was waiting to inform them until Elvira could provide a list of suitable replacements. Florencia was likewise reviewing Wilfried’s retainers, and Ferdinand suspected Oswald would be one of the first cut. Ever since his charge had stated his intentions to become Knight Commander, his service had been less than stellar.</p><p>When the day came, the children traveled to his estate by carriage, and Lasfam welcomed them inside. Like a proper host, Ferdinand greeted them and invited them to tea. After Ferdinand took the first demonstrative bite, Wilfried practically attacked the cookies. He consumed nearly a dozen before he even finished his first cup of tea. Training with Bonifatius had greatly increased his appetite.</p><p>Rozemyne, too, ate more than she normally did. Her training appeared less arduous from the outside, but it required just as much effort, and she was at the beginning of her summer. She would be growing quickly, which gave him a strange sense of melancholy. She was about to enter the parts of summer Anwachs had deprived her of in the first weave, making him feel like this was a different person from the Rozemyne he’d loved. His Rozemyne was gone, even as she sat before him.</p><p>“Ferdinand?” she asked, tilting her head.</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>Her mouth was pulled down into a slight frown as she studied him, and as she opened it to say something, her eyes darted to her siblings before she closed it again. <em>I can’t talk about it with them here, but I know there’s something on your mind,</em> her gaze seemed to say.</p><p>Just how long had she been able to read him so clearly? Had she always been able to see past the carefully crafted exterior, or had he simply let his guard down too much once he’d separated her from her family? Perhaps his insurmountable guilt and desire to comfort her had made him more vulnerable to her the moment she signed that contract.</p><p>Chasing the errant thoughts from his mind, he had Lasfam clear the table and then began instructing them in magic. While the children worked on the various tasks he gave them, he probed Rozemyne about her mana levels, trying to determine how much her vessel had grown, how much space she now had, and how much she was able to compress. It didn’t take long for her to catch on, however, and she started reversing his questions on him. Of course, he refused to answer them. It would profit him nothing to offer such information for free. Armed with her complete compression method, any answer he gave would soon be false, anyway.</p><p>In fact, he’d been employing her compression method whenever he had the chance since returning. He felt an immense pressure to increase his mana as much as possible, knowing that Rozemyne had only been able to sense the king of Lanzenave once she had an adult body. And with Anwachs seeing to her physical growth, she would have no reason in this weave to stop compressing, either. He needed to ensure they would still match once her growth period ended.</p><p>Eventually, he announced they would review history and geography in his library. Rozemyne’s eyes lit up like full moons, and he admonished her for getting too excited. In the previous weave, she would still faint even after having her clumps dissolved, and he wasn’t sure if that would still be true after the gods’ intervention or not. Better not to risk it either way.</p><p>“How can I <em>not</em> get excited?!” she gushed. “It’s a library! A library! A personal library!”</p><p>He wanted to ban her from seeing it until she could comport herself like a noble, but that would ruin his plans. Instead, he settled for glaring at her before leading the three children into his workshop. Once inside, Rozemyne gasped and darted to one of the shelves, gazing at the spines, running her fingers over the bindings and… Good gods, was she <em>smelling</em> his books?</p><p>“Rozemyne!”</p><p>“Ahhh, the smell of old ink and parchment… The beautiful leather covers… The sheer quantity of reading material… Just how many books do you have, Ferdinand? How are they organized? Are they all about magic? Did you write any yourself, or were they all transcribed by someone else? Where did you get them? Are they original works? Copied from the castle? The Royal Academy?”</p><p>As her litany of questions continued, he rubbed his temples and wondered if this was how she felt when he started asking her research-related questions.</p><p>“Uncle, you really only have yourself to blame,” Wilfried sighed. “You brought her into a room full of books. You should have known this is what would happen.”</p><p>Charlotte watched her sister in a state of disconcerted awe. “Sh-she truly adores books, doesn’t she?”</p><p>“Oh, you haven’t seen one of her rampages before, have you?” Wilfried asked. “Cornelius told me she passed out when he took her to their estate’s bookroom. Whenever she goes to the castle bookroom, Rihyarda has to physically rip whatever Rozemyne’s reading out of her hands to get her to go eat dinner.”</p><p>“Oh… Oh, my…”</p><p>“Rozemyne, you’re scaring your sister. Now come over here.”</p><p>“What?! You can’t show me this magnificent sight and not allow me to read! How cruel!”</p><p>Ferdinand crossed his arms and sighed. “I’ll let you spend an entire day reading in here if you memorize all the history and geography content.”</p><p>“A WHOLE DAY?” she cried, and before he could stop her, she threw her arms into the air and yelled, “Praise be to the gods!” An irrationally large blessing shot from her outstretched hands and shimmered down over them.</p><p>Groaning, Ferdinand rubbed his temples as a headache started pounding at the inside of his skull. Just how much havoc was she going to wreak with those blessings of hers? He had half a mind to have her complete her divine protection ceremony now before she got her schtappe, but that would change events that needed to happen. It was the initial confusion over the number of protections she, Wilfried, and Roderick received and the resulting hypothesis that participating in religious ceremonies increased one’s protections that led to the joint research with Dunklefelger, the results of which were seen by the leaders of all the duchies. This was valuable information they needed to disseminate to the entire country to increase the number of Zent candidates going forward. The entire process was also an important learning experience for Rozemyne. He didn’t want to do anything that would take such opportunities away from her.</p><p>Aside from that, doing it now wouldn’t prevent the blessings she showered left and right during her first year at the Royal Academy. In fact, it might make the first couple worse since she wouldn’t have a schtappe to help control her mana yet.</p><p>Putting off the divine protection ceremony would leave her with an inadequate schtappe again, but he had a plan for that.</p><p>Rozemyne drew his attention back to the present as she held her hands out to him, demanding he hand over the materials she needed to memorize. “Nothing is going to stand between me and my day of paradise!”</p><p>“Uncle?” Wilfried asked, eyeing her warily. “Are you sure about this?”</p><p>No, he wasn’t, but it was too late to walk it back now. So as Rozemyne furiously reviewed the royal family tree, he went over recent history with Wilfried and Charlotte, detailing for them the events leading up to and following the civil war, the implications of the drastic actions taken, the participation of each duchy, and the results of that participation. This led to a lecture on the members of each archduke family they were likely to meet when they started attending the Royal Academy and what to watch out for, such as avoiding ditter challenges with Dunklefelger. While he was at it, he explained how the different types of ditter worked, specifically the bride-taking and bride-stealing varieties.</p><p>“So if I were already engaged to someone from another duchy,” Charlotte asked, “they could challenge us to a ditter to take me instead?”</p><p>“In theory, yes.”</p><p>“And that’s allowed?” Wilfried asked. “Even if the king has already approved the engagement?”</p><p>That served as the perfect segue into discussing how certain laws superseded royal decrees.</p><p>Rozemyne, who was surprisingly somehow still paying attention while studying the family tree, asked if the Zent’s third wife had used ditter to secure her engagement, which led to an explanation of Dunklefelger-style proposals. He failed to mention that it was his own engagement that was broken off as a result of Magdelena’s desperation. While he cared nothing for the woman, he had felt bitter at the time for losing his escape route out of Ehrenfest.</p><p>Now, he couldn’t have been more thankful. He would much rather tie his stars to the only woman who had ever truly cared about him.</p><p>Even if she did smell his books.</p><p> </p><p>That evening after they had dinner at the castle, Rozemyne was summoned to the aub’s private room along with Karstedt and Ferdinand. After clearing the room and putting up a sound barrier, Sylvester slumped back in his chair and said, “Rozemyne, we need to discuss your engagement.”</p><p>“Engagement?” she asked, tilting her head. “Aren’t I a bit young for that?”</p><p>Karstedt shook his head. “Age has nothing to do with it.”</p><p>“But why so soon?” she asked. “Is this a ploy to ensure Wilfried becomes aub? I thought he wanted to be Knight Commander.”</p><p>Sylvester waved away the question. “I’m not engaging you to my son. That’d be an utter disaster. He couldn’t even hope to hold your reins.”</p><p>“Hey, I’m not a wild horse, you know!”</p><p>“Yeah? Tell that to all the victims of your rampages!”</p><p>She glared at him and puffed out her cheeks, unable to argue back.</p><p>Sylvester grinned triumphantly for a moment before donning a serious expression. “To answer your question, your mana capacity is high enough that we’re afraid you’ll draw the attention of the Greater Duchies or the Sovereignty. It would be hard, if not impossible, to refuse any marriage requests from them unless we already had you engaged to someone else.”</p><p>“Ah,” she said, “so this is to keep me in Ehrenfest. Really, though, is this an actual concern? As you pointed out with Wilfried, I’m not exactly a desirable bride. I don’t have any girl power.”</p><p>“Girl power…? You know what? I’m not even going to ask,” Sylvester sighed, shaking his head. “But yes, you’d absolutely be a desirable candidate for first or second wife. Aside from your mana capacity - which is more important for the mother than the father - there are all of the industries you’ve started here in Ehrenfest, and I know you’ve got more ideas knocking around in that crazy brain of yours.”</p><p>She grimaced as he pointed a finger at her, looking away from him.</p><p>“Ha! I knew it! What else do you have up there? Huh?”</p><p>“Sylvester,” Karstedt warned, motioning for him to sit back down.</p><p>He plopped back into his chair with a heavy sigh. “Right, right. Anyway, the Saint-of-Ehrenfest story’s been around for a couple of years, meaning it’s likely spread at the Royal Academy.” She grimaced at that, but Sylvester continued, unperturbed, “We want to get your engagement approved before anyone too powerful starts getting curious, and as I’m sure you’re aware, your options here are really limited if you want to be able to have children. And when I say ‘really limited,’ I mean <em>’really</em> limited.’”</p><p>“Because of my mana?”</p><p>Sylvester nodded. “Because of your mana.”</p><p>She tilted her head again, a hand resting on her cheek. “Are we even sure I can have children?”</p><p>“Do you not want them?” Karstedt asked, worry wrinkling his brow.</p><p>“Oh, don’t get me wrong, I would love to have children. I would make them toys and read picture books to them and make them into proper bookworms!”</p><p>Ferdinand turned away from the looks of pity he was receiving. “As your doctor,” he said, “I don’t currently see a reason why you shouldn’t be able to have children, so long as you have a partner that can match your capacity.”</p><p>“Wait, weren’t you just yelling at me earlier to calm down because I might still pass out if I get too excited?”</p><p>“It’s still a possibility,” he acknowledged, “but your health is far from grave enough to prevent your having children if you desire it.”</p><p>Rozemyne nodded and looked back to Sylvester. “Since my options are limited, I assume you’ve already picked my partner?”</p><p>“Yeah,” he nodded. “Ferdinand.”</p><p>She turned to him as if expecting an answer to her question. As the silence stretched, her eyes slowly lit with recognition. “Wait! <em>Ferdinand?!</em>”</p><p>Karstedt chuckled and said, “He truly is the only person in Ehrenfest who can match you.”</p><p>“And hold your leash,” Sylvester added.</p><p>Her eyes darted around the room for several frantic moments before they met his. Her face flushed the color of Geduldh, and she quickly snapped her gaze back to Sylvester.</p><p>Just what was she thinking in that head of hers? She seemed more embarrassed than disturbed, and that confused him. From her perspective, it hadn’t been that long ago when Sylvester had teased them, saying they should get married, and she had responded that she didn’t want to be tied to a… What was it she called him? Ah, yes, a “perpetually unhappy lecture factory.”</p><p>He knew what had changed his mind from that night - her threatening to take over the entire country for him, her bursting into the supply room after stealing Ahrensbach’s foundation to save him, her calling him family.</p><p>What had changed hers? She hadn’t shared those moments with him. The vast majority of her memories with him likely centered around his perpetually unhappy lectures. Yes, he had saved her when she was poisoned, but that hardly compared to what she’d done for him. He’d performed his role as a guardian. She had conquered a Greater Duchy.</p><p>While he searched for answers in her open expression, he realized what had her so flustered.</p><p>They had just been talking about having children.</p><p>She was thinking about–</p><p><em>This shameless little…!</em> A glance as Sylvester confirmed he’d come to the same conclusion.</p><p>He was going to pinch the cheeks right off of her face.</p><p>“So,” Sylvester said, a wry grin on his face, “I take you find the arrangement amenable?”</p><p>If Ferdinand’s ears got any hotter, they were going to set fire to his hair.</p><p>The question pulled Rozemyne out of the unspeakable thoughts she was entertaining, and she straightened her back, her expression serious. “So in order to prevent me from being taken by one of the Greater Duchies or Sovereignty, you wish to have me marry my guardian.”</p><p>That shot a pang through him. Had she always seen him as nothing more than her Erwachlehren, even after saving him? Could he never be her Dark God?</p><p>Before Sylvester could respond, she continued, “I’ve learned that the Greater Duchies have far more resources than Ehrenfest, even considering the extra land they have to supply. I imagine such resources could vastly increase the printing industry beyond anything Ehrenfest could handle.”</p><p>Ferdinand began to panic. What good was a library when she could print hundreds of books in the time it would take to transcribe ten? He’d been too arrogant. She hadn’t acted differently from the night of the Starbinding because her opinion of him had ameliorated; she’d simply been embarrassed by the topic.</p><p>“What are you trying to say?” Sylvester asked, slipping into his aub persona.</p><p>“That I’m potentially giving up quite a lot for your gain. I think it’s only fair to ask for some form of compensation.”</p><p>…Was she treating him like Sigiswald? Just how low was her opinion of him? “Well?” he asked, masking his disappointment. “What is it you want?”</p><p>Her eyes lit up, though she made a visible effort to show no emotion. “Your library.”</p><p>He…should have seen that coming. “Very well. Once our stars are tied, it will be yours.”</p><p>“And…”</p><p>There was more?!</p><p>She paused for a bit then said, “I don’t want to be trained as anyone’s right-hand man. Of course, I will support the future aub, but whoever it is, they should be able to fulfill the responsibilities of the role without me covering for their incompetence, don’t you think?”</p><p>“Rozemyne,” Ferdinand admonished her, “think before you speak. Do you know what your words just implied?”</p><p>Sylvester certainly did from the dark look on his face.</p><p>With a shake of her head, she said, “I only refer to your own admission that you were training me to cover for Wilfried’s many weaknesses as you did not think him capable of even performing the most basic of duties at the time.”</p><p>Now Sylvester’s dark look was pointed at him. Rubbing his brow, Ferdinand said, “That was when he was struggling to pass his winter debut. At any rate, even you have to admit he’s better suited to being Knight Commander, and he seems happier pursuing that role than he ever did aub.”</p><p>“Fine,” Sylvester said, waving a hand through the air. “It’s not like training you for that purpose was ever my idea to begin with. Anything else?”</p><p>She gave a short nod and said, “Yes, but I would like to discuss it with Ferdinand alone, please.”</p><p>Sylvester and Karstedt exchanged a look before they turned to him, their eyes saying, “You better behave yourself!” and “Don’t mess this up!” He glared back at them until finally Sylvester conceded to Rozemyne’s wish.</p><p>“Alright, Rozemyne,” Sylvester said, “but keep in mind we’re making an exception here.”</p><p>She tilted her head at that, causing Ferdinand’s stomach to tense. He prayed to any god that would still listen to him that she would keep her mouth shut about her many trips to his hidden room. Otherwise, he didn’t know which would kill him first - Karstedt’s wrath or Sylvester’s teasing.</p><p>Once they left, he allowed himself to relax a little. “Well?”</p><p>“I want the right to demand hugs whenever I need them, and you can’t say no!” she said, looking like a smug little gremlin.</p><p>“Rozemyne,” he sighed as he rubbed his temples, “you’re getting older, and it’s…not exactly appropriate for us to go into a hidden room alone. We avoided ill rumors before since you looked so young, but…”</p><p>His words trailed off as her face became ashen. Her hands shook as she asked in a small, trembling voice, “S-so no more hugs?”</p><p>The look in her eyes pierced him like Leidenschaft’s Spear. Those four words tore his heart and stole the breath from his lungs. She was so small, so vulnerable, so <em>alone</em>. There was nowhere in noble society to get the physical comfort she so desperately needed and nowhere he was allowed to give it to her. At least, not here in Ehrenfest while their stars were still unbound. In the previous weave, they still met in private for one reason or another, but he didn’t think things would be so simple once they were engaged.</p><p>He might be able to keep pulling her into his hidden room until Cornelius came of age, but it would take a single slip of the tongue from one of the priests to destroy her reputation. She was already “raised in the temple.” He didn’t want to have her labeled a flower as well.</p><p>She had had longer in the previous weave to get physical affection from Lutz in her hidden room, but now that she looked her age, he could only justify giving her two or three visits to get her affairs in order. After being kidnapped, poisoned, nearly killed, and put to sleep for over a year only to wake up to a different body and a world that had moved on without her, she needed comfort now more than ever.</p><p>And it killed him to be unable to give it to her.</p><p>“Rozemyne, it’s…” He sighed as he searched for words. “We can’t for now.”</p><p>She gave a sad nod, her entire body trembling, her mind likely filled with the affectionate family she’d left behind and the loss of the small comfort of his reluctant embrace.</p><p>Ferdinand reached for her but caught himself, leaving his hand hovering in the air just short of touching her. He needed to put an end to this. If he gave in, he would continue to find excuses to keep hugging her whenever she needed it, even if it hurt her in the long run.</p><p>He heard a quiet sniffle, and the next thing he knew, she was in his arms. She stood stiff in his embrace, obviously as shocked by his shameless behavior as he was. After a moment, she relaxed, bringing him out of his blank reverie.</p><p>“Rozemyne,” he whispered, “this will be the last time until–” He cut himself off, having come dangerously close to mentioning the supply room in Alexandria. Instead, he finished with, “until you’re older.” He felt her nod against his shoulder. “This is all I can offer you. I’m sorry.”</p><p>She wrapped her arms around him and clenched his robes in her trembling fists as she sobbed into his chest. Rubbing her back and stroking her soft hair, he remembered the last time she had cried in his arms like this. It was in his hidden room before he left for Ahrensbach. She had cried for him, expressing the pain that he could not.</p><p>Because he was her family.</p><p>
<em>Do you consider me your family, Rozemyne?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Am I part of your Geduldh?</em>

<p>Rozemyne’s tears eventually dried, but she continued to hold on to him. In the past, he would have shoved her away at this point, but now he couldn’t bear the thought of letting her go while she still clung to him.</p><p>“Ferdinand,” she called, her voice hoarse with spent emotion, “are you okay with this?”</p><p>A bit late for that, wasn’t it, given she’d already bargained with Aub Ehrenfest for their engagement? “Given the other options, I think this will work out the best for you. You’ll still be in the same duchy as your downtown family, so you’ll still be able to see Gunther and Tuuli on occasion and exchange letters when possible. Even if you brought them with you to a Greater Duchy or the Sovereignty, there is no guarantee you would be able to see or communicate with them. It would be difficult, too, for you to bring your laynoble retainers, such as Damuel, as they may struggle significantly more in those places.”</p><p>She pushed against his chest until she had him at arm’s length and glared at him. “I didn’t ask how this would benefit me. I asked if you’re okay with this!”</p><p>So she had cared about his feelings this early. Just what had he done to earn that consideration? It defied all logic. “Yes,” he eventually said, “I am okay with it.”</p><p>“You’re not just saying that?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Sylvester didn’t put you up to this?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>She searched his eyes for several moments before understanding dawned on her face. “That’s why you showed me your library today, isn’t it?!” she cried, making him wince. She’d seen right through him. “I thought it was strange that you decided to bring us to your estate instead of tutoring us in the castle like always, especially since there didn’t seem to be any real reason for it. I don’t know if I feel tricked or elated.”</p><p>Before he could respond, she scoffed and said, “Aw, who am I kidding? Of course I’m elated! So many books! Truly, there is no better, more romantic gesture than gifting your bride a personal library! Any marriage built on such a foundation would surely be greatly blessed by the Supreme Couple! Oh, I can’t wait until I can spend an entire day basking in the wondrous smell of books and indulging in magnificent, uninterrupted reading time!”</p><p>“Not ‘uninterrupted,’” he corrected her. “You will still need to take breaks for meals.”</p><p>“Who needs food when you have books to sustain you?”</p><p>“I see. Then, I, too, shall enjoy an entire day of uninterrupted research.”</p><p>“Ngh…!” She grimaced at him for a moment before finally nodding. “Fine, but we have to eat together!”</p><p>He easily agreed since they would be taking their meals together that day regardless. “Rozemyne,” he said, shifting uncomfortably, “are you agreeable to this?”</p><p>“Yes,” she answered immediately. His heart leapt. “I knew when I was adopted that I’d be used in a political marriage.” His heart plummeted. “To be honest,” she continued, “I thought I’d be engaged to Wilfried, but this is a much happier turn of events. I didn’t really care who I had to marry so long as I could still be surrounded by books, but I knew if I married him I’d be stuck doing his work all the time like you do with Sylvester, so I probably wouldn’t have gotten much reading time. On top of that, he doesn’t even <em>like</em> reading! How terrible! What an absolute waste to have access to a bookroom your entire life and not even visit it! Really, I think this is a much better deal. No one could possibly compare to your quality as a fiance.”</p><p>“Oh?” he asked, quirking a brow.</p><p>She puffed out her chest and said, “Is there anyone else in Yurgenschmidt who would give me an entire library? Truly, there isn’t anyone else who can match my lust for books!”</p><p>Ferdinand frowned and flicked her forehead. “Don’t lump me in with you, bookfiend! No one is as bizarrely obsessed with books as you!”</p><p>Rubbing her forehead with tearful eyes, she shot back, “Why do you have the largest private book collection in the country, then, if you’re not a bookworm in your heart of hearts?”</p><p>“<em>One</em> of the largest,” he corrected. There was likely someone in Drewanchel with more.</p><p>An evil grin spread across her face. “It’ll be the largest by the time I’m done with it! Ehehehe!”</p><p>“Good grief…” He covered his eyes and tried to find some hidden energy reserve to deal with this book gremlin. “Are there any other conditions?”</p><p>She tilted her head for a moment before her eyes widened slightly. Had this fool already forgotten why they were alone in the aub’s office?</p><p>“No,” she said, “not right now.”</p><p>“So you’ll be getting engaged to me, your guardian, in exchange for my private book collection. Sounds like I’m giving up quite a lot for your gain,” he said with a smirk. “I think it’s only fair to ask for some form of compensation.” There was no harm in adding some beneficial conditions of his own. As Benno had taught her, “When you get the chance to earn money, take it and profit as much as you can,” though he’d be gaining something far more valuable than gold.</p><p>As his grin deepened, her back straightened. Perfect, he had her on the defensive. “What do you want?” she asked.</p><p>“You get my books for free, I get your recipes for free. You also have your personal chef train mine in how to make them.”</p><p>“That seems like a strange deal,” she said, tilting her head with faked innocence. “I won’t get the library until after we marry, and since our chefs will be sharing the same kitchen, they’ll naturally learn the recipes then, would they not?” Then, with a wicked grin, she said, “I could, of course, trade you one recipe for each book you allow me to read before our Starbind Ceremony.”</p><p>He quickly ran through some calculations, determining how many recipes he could reasonably obtain while still holding enough books back to use as leverage until they married. “Fine, if you agree to also provide me with one new song a season.”</p><p>“I’ll give you a song for each day you let me read.”</p><p>“Half day, but again, only once a season.” He wasn’t about to fall into that trap. If he didn’t specify how often she could make that trade, she’d have a hundred songs ready to go by the end of the week.</p><p>“Ngh… Deal!”</p><p>“And…”</p><p>“Huh? There’s more?”</p><p>He smirked at her and said, “You have to assist with my feyplant research in seven years after our Starbind.”</p><p>“It’s only a year earlier than promised, so that’s fair,” she said. “I’ll give you as much of my mana as you want then.”</p><p>The tips of his ears flushed with heat as he covered his face with an exasperated sigh. “Good gods, Elvira’s training can’t come soon enough. Do <em>not</em> speak of giving someone your mana, especially when discussing binding your stars with your betrothed.”</p><p>When she tilted her head, he waved her off, unwilling to elaborate further to a nine-year-old.</p><p>“Fine. So was that everything, Ferdinand?”</p><p>“Yes, those were my only conditions.”</p><p>“Then I accept.”</p><p>“So you agree to marry me upon your coming of age?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>He was not prepared for what that one word did to his heart, nor did she seem prepared for what it did to his expression. She blinked at him in surprise. He quickly got control of himself again, but the damage was done. She’d already seen his shameless display.</p><p>“I think that’s the first time I’ve seen you smile with all of your heart,” she said, warmth radiating from her eyes.</p><p>As his ears burst into flames, he got to his feet and said, “It’s time to call the others back in. There’s more to discuss.”</p><p>Her annoying little giggle almost drove him to pinch her cheeks again, but he restrained himself and instead opened the door.</p><p>Sylvester and Karstedt entered, both eyeing him curiously. “Well?” the former asked as he went to sit behind his desk.</p><p>“We’ve reached an agreement,” Ferdinand said.</p><p>“And how much is it costing me?” Sylvester asked, a weary look in his eyes.</p><p>“You? Nothing.”</p><p>He grinned. “Well, that’s the best news I’ve heard all day! I’ll petition the king at the Archduke Conference, then.”</p><p>Rozemyne’s eyes widened in a panic. “Is there a chance it will be rejected?” she asked. To an outsider, she would appear as a girl deep in spring, worried over a potential obstacle between her and her dark god. However, Ferdinand knew she was more concerned about losing the library than anything else.</p><p>Shaking his head, Sylvester said, “Not likely. It’s a marriage within the duchy, so it really doesn’t require anything but my permission for him to approve. Besides, they have bigger problems than worrying about an engagement in a middle-ranked duchy.”</p><p>She nodded in understanding, Ferdinand’s history lessons having paid off. “So when will we announce this?”</p><p>“Right before you enroll in the Royal Academy,” Sylvester answered, earning a swift glare from Ferdinand. Hadn’t they discussed announcing it after she returned from her first term? His brother ignored him as he continued, “So don’t tell anyone.”</p><p>“Except Elvira,” Karsted put in. “Since she’s leading your ladies’ education, you’ll need to speak with her about matters related to your engagement.”</p><p>“Yes, Father.”</p><p>“Alright,” Sylvester said, waving a hand at her. “That was it. You can go.”</p><p>“May you sleep well with Schlaftraum’s blessing.”</p><p>After Rozemyne left, Ferdinand glared at Sylvester and demanded an explanation. “If you announce it then, winter socializing will be a nightmare.”</p><p>“Hey, the whole point of getting her engaged this early was to ward off high-ranking suitors. If you send her to the academy without a courtship necklace, everyone will assume she’s fair game, which will cause me problems at the interduchy tournament and Archduke Conference. If she goes wearing one and we don’t announce it, word will get back here, and the Liesegangs will practically storm the castle, thinking we’re marrying her off to some other duchy!</p><p>“So no, I’m not going to wait until after she returns. I’m going to announce it right after the gifting ceremony and keep Ehrenfest from burning down around our ears.”</p><p>Ferdinand’s frown deepened as Sylvester leaned back in his chair with a heavy sigh. He thought about what would happen should he not give Rozemyne courtship jewelry before she left for the academy. The boys had been dismissive of her because she looked so young, but if she looked her age, they’d be just as likely to consider her a prospect as any other first year, maybe more so, given her youthful beauty. He wasn’t worried about that Ewigeliebe of a younger prince since he only had eyes for his Geduldh, but what about that insect from Dunklefelger? He’d challenged her to a bride-taking ditter once he and his father had discovered how valuable she was. He doubted Bluanfah had danced for the boy, given Rozemyne’s stunted growth at the time, but Ferdinand had seen that painting he’d done of her. Her blessing from Efflorelume would surely draw his attention again.</p><p>Then there were all those pests at the interduchy tournament who had approached Aub Ehrenfest, seeking a match with her for their sons or grandsons or nephews. A couple had even hinted at taking her as their water goddess themselves, the louts.</p><p>Sylvester was right. He needed to crush those bugs before they even thought of circling her. Surely they wouldn’t be so foolish as to approach a woman covered in another man’s mana.</p><p>“Karstedt,” Sylvester said, bringing Ferdinand back to the present, “I’ll announce Ferdinand’s intent to return to the Knights Order at the same time. Will you be prepared by then?”</p><p>“Yes, it should be no problem.”</p><p>“Good. And Ferdinand?”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“Don’t go overboard.”</p><p>He furrowed his brows. “What do you mean?”</p><p>Sylvester sighed, hanging his head. “I mean your tendency to brute force anything involving magic tools or mana. Don’t cover Rozemyne in ice, alright? We don’t need rumors about you inviting winter before autumn. You know what that would do to her reputation.”</p><p>“I’m well aware. I have no intention of becoming Ewigeliebe.”</p><p>…He was going to need a new plan.</p>

<h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
<p>My little brother had often been compared to a statue, but really, he was a fortress. He trusted no one, save me, Karstedt, and his name sworn retainers. No one else could get past his formidable walls.</p><p>Except for the shumil.</p><p>When he first told me about her, he seemed to think of her as nothing more than a resource. By the time I met her myself, however, they’d become attached to each other. He could deny it all he wanted, but whenever she ran to him for protection (which was weird in and of itself), he actually protected her rather than offer her up as a sacrifice to avoid my teasing. I named him her guardian since he was pretty much already doing the job, and he spent more time with her than anyone else since they both stayed at the temple so much.</p><p>The year following her adoption, he had flipped between extremes. One on hand, he helped her gather some of the most powerful ingredients for her jureve, even going so far as to make arrangements for her to take the Lord of Winter’s feystone and bodily throw himself at the mysterious barrier at the Goddess’ Bath. On the other, he forced her to scheme the mayor of Hasse’s demise, causing her to fall ill from the stress. He was never one for half measures, but even I had been shocked by the intensity of his training.</p><p>Everything changed the winter after she made her jureve, however. When Charlotte was kidnapped and Rozemyne was poisoned, no one took it harder than Ferdinand. It was like he became a different person overnight. Suddenly, he went from working her half to death and scolding her all the time (which she deserved, by the way) to keeping her locked away like Ewigeliebe and killing himself trying to look after her alone. He’d only let Elvira see her out of sheer desperation.</p><p>He also started shielding Rozemyne’s lower city associates from the demands of nobility. Ordinarily, he would have kept silent when Elvira wanted to have the printing industry established in Haldenzel and materials for socializing published as soon as possible, if not before. However, he’d convinced her to back down and drafted a more reasonable schedule while arranging to have merchants and craftspeople from Elvira’s home province travel to Ehrenfest rather than the other way around.</p><p>It was around that time, too, he began admonishing me for my treatment of Rozemyne, pointing out how differently I treated her from my other kids. I felt that was unfair. He was responsible for most of her hardships. I had intended to appoint her as a figurehead in the temple to allow her to continue working with her downtown associates and give her some place to at least see her sister since she’d become her personal hairpin designer. I wasn’t expecting Ferdinand to actually have her carry out the High Bishop’s duties at such a young age.</p><p>He was right, though. I couldn’t justify sending her to the temple and letting him train her while keeping Charlotte and Wilfried as far away from the situation as possible. Still, it surprised me that he was willing to not only scold me but also start tutoring Wilfried, a child he saw little to no value in, to relieve some of Rozemyne’s burdens. Running himself to death to look after her I could more or less understand. He’d always taken on more work than was perhaps reasonable. Doing something he thought of as a waste of time like training Wilfried was completely out of character.</p><p>When he refused to help at the castle, I had at first assumed he was just following the precedent Rozemyne had set when she’d refused to let him do anything beyond his temple duties. Combined with the rest of his strange behaviors, however, it became more and more obvious that he was offloading as much work as possible so he could spend more time watching over Rozemyne.</p><p>I had thought guilt had driven Ferdinand’s actions, but his underlying motives became clear after our most recent meeting. When he first brought up training Wilfried and Charlotte after the attack, he’d vehemently opposed the idea of getting my son engaged to Rozemyne. I had thought at the time that he just didn’t want her to marry someone he thought so unexceptional, but after she woke up, I mentioned having him marry her himself again, and he didn’t object. In fact, he started detailing a plan to get them engaged without rousing the Liesegangs.</p><p>A plan he’d obviously been concocting for a while.</p><p>Looking back on it, I could see how he’d carefully lured me into his trap. I’d rationalized his behavior as his overprotectiveness from her near-death rearing its ugly head, but then I saw the look on his face when I mentioned sending her to the academy without any visible proof she was already engaged.</p><p>It was then I began to think I had made a terrible mistake. Again, my little brother did nothing by half measures. I could already see him covering her in so many charms and pieces of jewelry that she’d collapse under the weight. He, of course, was oblivious enough to anything involving romance that he’d fail to understand the implications of such a thing, so I did what I could to shut that nonsense down right then and there.</p><p>I was reasonably certain he’d still find a way to encase her in ice without tipping me off.</p><p>Still, I couldn’t get mad at him. Up until this point, he’d always avoided women to the point that I wondered if his desires lay…elsewhere. Sure, he’d been upset when his engagement had been canceled, but it didn’t take a genius to figure out it had nothing to do with the girl. It was heartwarming to see him finally start opening up to the possibility of spring. Really, I just wanted him to be happy.</p><p>I just really, really hoped his actions weren’t driven by guilt.</p>

<p>Life at the temple resumed. While Rozemyne practiced her harspiel in the morning, Ferdinand attended to the work that had piled up during their absence. She and her retinue came at third bell to assist with paperwork as usual, and once Elvira arrived, they had a pleasant start to lunch.</p><p>After the general greetings and such were done, Rozemyne asked permission to erect a sound barrier. While Ferdinand wished she would wait until she was alone with Elvira to make the announcement, he still called for the tool and activated it. Once everything was in place, Rozemyne said, “Mother, I have some important news that Father asked me to share with you.”</p><p>“Oh, did he now?”</p><p>“Yes, you see, I am to be engaged to Ferdinand.”</p><p>Elvira froze, her wide, sparkling eyes flashing between the two. “Oh, my. Oh, my, my, my, my, my, my!” Her hand discretely dipped below the table into the leather pouch hanging from her belt as a bright yet noble smile graced her lips. “I see. I see. Well, let me be the first to welcome you into our family, Lord Ferdinand.”</p><p>“We are not making it public until winter,” he said, sending a pointed look at Rozemyne. She sent one back that said, <em>I was going to tell her! I hadn’t forgotten!</em></p><p>“Winter, you say?” Elvira placed a delicate hand on her cheek and said, “My, we have much to prepare, then. I’ll have all the necessary tools brought here tomorrow, but may I ask to have my daughter come to our estate for a short stay?”</p><p>“How long, exactly?”</p><p>“Oh, it’s hard to say when it comes to these matters, but I should think two weeks would suffice for now.”</p><p>Two weeks? Ferdinand tapped his temple as he thought through the work they needed to complete as well as the curriculum he’d yet to teach Rozemyne. “Very well. She can go next week.”</p><p>“Mother,” Rozemyne interjected, “what all must be prepared? What will I be learning at the estate?”</p><p>“We’ll discuss that later,” Elvria said. With a mischievous grin, she asked, “Have you informed Eckhart yet?”</p><p>“No,” Ferdinand said. He’d planned to, since he was name sworn, but he hadn’t had the opportunity since the matter was settled the night before.</p><p>That answer seemed to please Elvira. “I see. Well, I shall allow you to be the one to inform him. Now, tell me, how did this come about?”</p><p>Glancing at Rozemyne, Ferdinand frowned slightly and said, “Given the circumstances, it seemed best to have her engaged before she went to the Royal Academy.”</p><p>Nodding briskly, Elvira took out her diptych and scratched down a couple of notes. “Yes, even Verbergen’s shroud cannot hide Efflorelume’s blessing. I imagine Bluanfah will dance abundantly this winter.”</p><p>Rozemyne’s confusion made it all the more apparent why she so desperately needed Elvira’s guidance. Before she could start asking questions, Ferdinand said, “Indeed. We were concerned most about those in the greatest heights, and as no one else in the duchy could match her affinities or capacity, there simply were not any other viable options.”</p><p>Her stylus flew over the diptych, making Ferdinand wonder just what he had said that sounded even remotely romantic. After a moment, he decided it was none of his concern. In order to make the story suitable for one of her novels, she would have to embellish it to the point it would be unrecognizable.</p><p>“Why do you make it sound like marrying me is like drinking one of your awful potions?” Rozemyne pouted. “I know I’m not exactly your ideal partner, but you don’t have to say it like it’s a death sentence.”</p><p>Her words stung, and the desire to correct her misunderstanding burned in his chest, but such was not appropriate, especially in front of others. “I simply stated the facts.”</p><p>“Oh? So if I described it like, ‘There was no one else who could match me, but at least he’s giving me a library,’ that would be fine with you?”</p><p>No, but that wasn’t remotely comparable to what he’d said. Before he could admonish her, however, Elvira said, “Oh, my! An entire library for my book-loving daughter? Lord Ferdinand, I see you are most skilled at enticing Bluanfah. Rozemyne, you must prepare an exceptional gift to match.”</p><p>“Oh?” she asked, placing a hand on that pinchable cheek. “But we’ve already agreed that I would give him recipes and new songs.”</p><p>Elvira was going to melt the wax if she wrote any faster. “And just what kind of songs are you planning to give him?”</p><p>Rozemyne’s eyes wavered for a moment before she said, “I couldn’t possibly say in front of Ferdinand. I would hate to ruin the surprise. Ohohoho~”</p><p>“Rozemyne has simply spent too long working with merchants,” Ferdinand said, trying to correct Elvira’s misconceptions. “She proposed a trade before accepting Aub’s orders.”</p><p>“So she even dared to bargain with the aub to begin building a foundation for what will be a blessed marriage.”</p><p>“Yes!” Rozemyne said. “See? Mother understands! Any marriage built on a library is fated to be blessed by the Supreme Couple!”</p><p>“That is not at all what she said, fool.”.</p><p>Wait, why was Elvira writing down that nonsense?!</p><p>A headache started throbbing at his temples, but thankfully, Rozemyne and Elvira soon left for her chambers to begin her first session in ladies’ education, leaving him in peace.</p><p>The next day when Rozemyne came to help with paperwork, she announced that she would be meeting with the Plantin Company later that week. Ferdinand held back a grimace as he passed her a sound blocking tool. She took it, looking up at him curiously.</p><p>“Rozemyne,” he said, his brows furrowing slightly, “I’m sure you recall our conversation where I explained why we could no longer go into my hidden room.”</p><p>She nodded, her noble facade faltering slightly.</p><p>“That…does not extend to me alone. You will no longer be able to bring merchants into your hidden room, either.”</p><p>Her eyes widened in a tearful panic, causing Ferdinand to leap from his chair and press an empty feystone against her forehead. And another. “Rozemyne!” he barked as he pulled out a third. “Control yourself!”</p><p>His warning did no good as evidenced by the sob she tried fruitlessly to bite back. “Good grief…” Dropping his sound blocking tool, he looked around at the startled, fearful retainers and said, “This is an emergency situation. Her mana is in danger of rampaging.” Explanation given, he took her into his hidden room and pulled her into a tight embrace. Her wildly pulsing mana began to slow as her sobs dissolved into hiccups.</p><p>“I… I thought I could still meet with them,” she whimpered, “since Damuel and Gil would be there.”</p><p>“No, it’s not appropriate to go into a hidden room with unrelated men.” He patted her back through the next bout of crying, waiting for her to calm down again. Once she was back to gentle hiccupping, he said, “I can give you until the start of summer. I know it’s not long, but even that much poses a threat to you. You already have so many weaknesses to exploit.”</p><p>“Since I have so many, what does it matter if we add another?”</p><p>“Fool! Do you not understand the danger you would put yourself in should you continue to meet with them in your hidden room? Your reputation would never recover. Even after the purge when every blue priest and shrine maiden with enough mana to wield a schtappe was taken from the temple, there were shrine maidens who were refused because of their rumored promiscuity. ”</p><p>She nodded. “I understand. I do, but…”</p><p>Her words caught in her throat as she began crying in earnest again, and he held her until she was ready to face the world outside his hidden room once more, even knowing it made him himself the biggest threat to her honor.</p><p> </p><p>Before Rozemyne left for the Linkbergs’, Ferdinand requested a meeting with Elvira. Once he activated the sound blocking tool, he said, “There are a few matters I must discuss with you.”</p><p>“How may I be of assistance, Lord Ferdiand?”</p><p>“It’s regarding Rozemyne.” The way her eyes lit up disquieted him, but he chose to ignore it. “First, I would like you to help her start gathering her retainers. We discussed possible candidates in the past, and I know Ottilie’s son is in the capital.</p><p>“She will also need at least one adult female knight, if not more, though I understand the difficulty of finding one willing to come to the temple.”</p><p>Elvira nodded as she made a note in her diptych. “I will discuss this with her while she is at our estate.”</p><p>And now he would have access to Hartmut, one of Rozemyne’s most talented, loyal, and easily manipulated retainers. He needed to meet with the boy as soon as possible.</p><p>Ferdinand coughed and said, “My other concern is…a bit more sensitive.” Elvira perked up. “You are aware of her true background. What you might not be aware of is how…physically affectionate commoners are.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Ferdinand tapped his temple as he thought of how to explain this. “Rozemyne grew up in a family that frequently hugged each other, held hands, and performed other such acts. They even all shared a bed. Her mood regularly plummets from lack of physical affection, and though I hate to ask this of you, I would appreciate it if you would fulfill that need for her.”</p><p>Elvira blinked at him for several moments before she brought her hand to her mouth. “Oh, I see. Lord Ferdinand, I assure you, this is not a burden at all. I know you would have no way to know this, but even we noble mothers show such signs of affection to our children, though often behind closed doors as they get older.”</p><p>That…shocked him. There were many parts of women’s society he knew little of, but this turned everything he believed on its head. If only he had known this in the previous weave, he would have been able to spare Rozemyne untold amounts of suffering. While rationally he understood that he had no way of knowing this before now, he still ached for what his ignorance had forced her to endure.</p><p>He tried to console himself, knowing that things would be different in this weave. However, it didn’t erase his Rozemyne’s pain. Perhaps he could ignore it if her feystone had not been sent back with him, but it was a constant reminder that she had existed, that she was real, that he had failed her, and now that he had subjected her to suffering she’d never had to experience.</p><p>If only he had spoken to Elvira…</p><p>Swallowing his guilt for now, he gave a brisk nod and said, “I see. Then I will entrust this matter to you.”</p><p> </p><p>During Rozemyne’s absence, Ferdinand had Charlotte, Wilfried, and their adult retainers - including Oswald’s replacement - come to the temple. As always, he trained the children in magic and helped them review other subjects before enlisting their and their retainers’ help with paperwork. The benefit was threefold: Wilfriend and Charlotte would improve their math and written skills, their retainers would cease to be utterly useless, and he’d have less work to do himself in the long run.</p><p>He only had two weeks to devote his entire focus to this and increase their mediocre skills to acceptable levels, so he was perhaps a bit harsher with the adult retainers than he normally was. Even so, he didn’t understand how adults who served the archduke family could have their spirits broken so easily. He wasn’t sure he had ever seen a grown man cry, save for Gunther when he was separated from Myne, but he came close to reliving the uncomfortable experience at least three times.</p><p>Really, how could they call themselves archnobles when Damuel, a laynoble, regularly completed the tasks assigned to him both faster and more accurately? Perhaps he needed to have another conversation with the archduke couple about the quality of their children’s retainers.</p><p> </p><p>At the end of Rozemyne’s stay with the Linkbergs, Ferdinand went to meet her at the castle. In just that short time period, she showed a marked improvement in how she comported herself, though for some reason, it bothered him how much less open her expression was.</p><p>Well, it was better than her showing her true emotions around a swarm of pests. He did want to keep her safe, after all. No reason to give them an opening.</p><p>Cornelius, however, could have learned from his little sister’s example, His displeasure at losing Rozemyne’s chef was all too apparent.</p><p>She had a meeting with Ottilie and Hartmut scheduled for that afternoon, and as expected, he eagerly agreed to be her scholar. The next day, Ferdinand met with the boy, claiming that as Rozemyne’s guardian, he needed to test his skill. He performed admirably, but as hoped, he wasn’t quite up to the standard of Charlotte’s or Wilfried’s arch scholars after their intensive training.</p><p>Using this, he made an appointment to speak with Rozemyne’s mothers. After the polite chit chat was out of the way, he broached the subject. “As I’m sure you’re aware, Rozemyne has very few retainers compared to her siblings. It’s only to be expected, of course, given her long absence, but as her duties require her to visit the temple, it’s difficult to find more willing to serve her, is it not?”</p><p>Florencia gave a troubled sigh and nodded. “Yes, even though my children, too, visit the temple, most of their adult retainers were appointed before they started attending regularly for training. As such, we have not struggled with them as we have with Rozemyne.”</p><p>“Father-in-law is ready to force someone to be Rozemyne’s guard knight,” Elvira said, “but we’ve managed to keep him contained by reminding him that anyone serving her unwillingly will not put her safety above all else.”</p><p>Ferdinand nodded. “Yes, I fear we may need to rely on appointing underaged knights to her service so they have time to come to terms with what serving their mistress will entail upon their coming of age. Perhaps by then the regular visits by the archducal children will improve noble society’s impression of the temple.</p><p>“However, until that comes to pass, I feel it is necessary to focus on the quality of the few retainers she has. To that end, I would like to train Hartmut to ensure he is able to bear the burden of serving an archduke candidate with so little support.”</p><p>“My,” Floriencia said, wrapping a hand around her teacup, “I certainly understand the reasoning, but…”</p><p>Elvira nodded. “Convincing Ottilie and Leberecht to allow him to enter the temple while underage might prove challenging.”</p><p>“That is why I have come seeking your assistance,” he said, spreading his hands in a slightly helpless gesture. “Perhaps when they hear of the vast improvement Charlotte’s and Wilfried’s retainers showed after a mere two weeks, they will be more amenable to the idea.”</p><p>“Well,” Florencia said, placing a hand on her cheek, “if he will be under your direct care, and it’s to better serve Rozemyne…”</p><p>“I’ll speak with Ottilie,” Elvira said. “As I have been to the temple myself, I can attest to its cleanliness.”</p><p>Ferdinand suppressed a grin. Any request from Florencia to Leberecht would be no less than a direct order, and Elvira’s testimony about her own visits would be nearly impossible to dismiss.</p>

<p>Ferdinand agreed to start training Hartmut during the Archduke Conference when he would already be at the castle to help with replenishment. The concession seemed more about Ottilie wanting to keep an eye on her fanatic son since he’d just entered Rozemyne’s service than any negative feelings regarding the temple.</p><p>Before the archducal couple left, Ferdinand passed a letter for Hirschur to Sylvester. “Do I even want to know what this is about?”</p><p>Ferdinand shrugged. “I’ve invited her to come to Ehrenfest to have any of her broken magical tools repaired.”</p><p>“Okay, but why?”</p><p>“Because I would like her to have every tool at her disposal when she starts educating our archduke candidates.”</p><p>Sylvester narrowed his eyes at him as he passed the letter off to his attendant. “You know, she likely doesn’t know any more than you do about hidden charms and such.”</p><p>“I don’t know what you’re referring to.”</p><p>“Uh huh. Sure you don’t.” Sylvester shook his head and sighed. “I’ll make sure she gets it, but I wouldn’t get my hopes up if I were you. You know she hasn’t come back in years.”</p><p>“Be sure to give it to her on the last day.”</p><p>“Fine, fine.” With that, he and Florencia said goodbye to all three children and teleported to the academy.</p><p>As everyone began filtering out of the teleportation room, Ferdinand had Hartmut follow him to his office. Rozemyne wouldn’t need a scholar for her joint harspiel practice with her siblings, so it was the perfect opportunity to meet with him alone. After Justus served tea, Ferdinand had him activate a sound blocking barrier and step out of range.</p><p>“Hartmut,” Ferdinand said after taking a demonstrative sip of tea and a bite of pound cake, “you are aware of the attack that left Rozemyne comatose for a year, are you not?”</p><p>“Of course, Lord Ferdinand,” he replied, his eyes burning behind his calm smile.</p><p>“And I trust you are aware of who the prime suspect is?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Ferdinand glanced at Justus and said, “I have tasked my attendant with gathering information related to the incident and all suspects involved. While he is exceptional at what he does, there are simply places he cannot enter. However, you are uniquely positioned to make contact with several people who can infiltrate our enemies’ private residences.”</p><p>Hartmut’s eyes widened just a fraction before a dark look of pleasure filled them, though his smile remained unfazed. “I see. I would be more than happy to serve the Saint of Ehrenfest in this matter. Simply tell me what you would like me to do.”</p><p>Ferdinand grinned as he began laying out the relevant parts of his plan.</p><p> </p><p>Once Sylvester and Florencia returned, the archduke family was called into the aub’s office for a meeting. “First thing’s first,” Sylvester said. “Ehrenfest is now ranked thirteenth thanks to improved grades and a slightly better performance in ditter overall. I expect our rank will rise higher this coming year with two archduke candidates starting this winter, Rozemyne and Wilfried spreading new trends, and new study materials raising grades further. The year after next, it may go up even more after Rozemyne gives that seminar on her compression method when she returns.”</p><p>Sylvester sighed as he shifted the topic to one less enjoyable. “Georgine tried to force a visit on us, but I was able to put her off by saying Rozemyne was still recovering.” He went on to list several small updates, and then said, “Wilfried, Rozemyne, Frenbeltag asked for chalices again this year, but we turned them down. They’re in a pretty tight spot, so expect your cousin Rudiger to approach you at the Royal Academy. You’ll need to prepare how you’re going to respond if and when he starts asking about getting assistance with mana.”</p><p>Rozemyne and Wilfried exchanged a look and nodded, silently agreeing to meet at some point in the future as their head attendants made notes to check their schedules.</p><p>That settled, he said, “Now, everyone clear the room except Ferdinand and Rozemyne.”</p><p>Wilfried and Charlotte gave their sister a curious look before they followed all of the retainers out the door. Once the room was clear, Sylvester activated a sound-blocking device.</p><p>“First, here,” Sylvester said, passing a letter over to Ferdinand. “From Hirschur.”</p><p>He tucked it away, already certain of what it said. “I assume that wasn’t the only reason you asked to speak with us alone.”</p><p>Sylvester nodded. “Yeah, the king approved your engagement.”</p><p>“As expected.” Ferdinand wasn’t expecting to feel as relieved as he did. Part of him feared Raublut would interfere, but the Sovereign Knight Commander wasn’t aware of his existence yet. He held no illusions that this engagement to Rozemyne would keep him completely safe, but as long as he avoided running into him, he should be fine.</p><p>“As I stated before, though,” Sylvester said, “we’re not announcing it until this winter, so don’t tell anyone.</p><p>“That being said, congratulations, you two.”</p><p>“I thank you ever so much,” Rozemyne replied, a noble smile on her face. Even with the improved facade, Ferdinand could tell she was nervous.</p><p>Once they were released, Ferdinand discretely passed her a sound blocking tool and walked with her towards his office where they would spend half a bell finishing up some work. “What has you so concerned?”</p><p>“Whatever do you mean?”</p><p>He sighed, resisting the urge to tap his temple. “When Sylvester said we had the king’s approval, you tensed up.”</p><p>She was silent for a long moment before she muttered, “I’m… I’m afraid I’m not experienced with this.”</p><p>“With what?”</p><p>“This,” she said, waving a hand between them, like a fool who’d forgotten they were <em>discreetly using sound blocking tools.</em> “Relationships. I never had one before.”</p><p>“Of course not. You’re nine.”</p><p>“I mean ever. Even…before.”</p><p>Hadn’t she been an adult woman when she died? “Did…courtship happen much later in life there?”</p><p>She shrugged. “People didn’t get married until their mid-twenties or so at the earliest, but they started dating much younger.” Her proceeding explanation of “dating” was baffling, but it was far from the most incomprehensible thing he’d witnessed from her previous life.</p><p>“But you never engaged in this…dating?”</p><p>“No, my only love was books. I even put them above my family…” She trailed off, looking forlornly into the distance before she blinked and came back to the present. “I’m worried because… Well, I don’t understand the love between men and women.”</p><p>With another sigh, Ferdinand said, “Again, you’re nine. No one expects you to understand such things.”</p><p>“But what if I never do, just like before?” she asked.</p><p>His chest locked up, but he kept his face blank. “Then you’ll be in good company. Love matches like Sylvester’s are few and far between. There is no reason to pressure yourself to feel things you don’t, and it’s much too soon for you to be concerning yourself with such matters. Focus on your education rather than a relationship that has yet to be made public.”</p><p>As she nodded, looking a little calmer, he tried to lock away his own rising doubts.</p><p>The next day, as predicted, Hirschur came back to Ehrenfest for the first time in possibly decades, along with several boxes of magical tools to be repaired. Ferdinand had them all delivered to his estate before he invited her over for lunch.</p><p>“So,” she said once the meal was served, “what was it that made you lure me into coming back to Ehrenfest? Oh, this is quite tasty. I don’t remember Ehrenfest food being this good.”</p><p>“It’s a recent development,” Ferdinand shrugged. “And I asked you to come to discuss my disciple who will be starting at the Royal Academy this winter.”</p><p>“Oh ho? <em>You</em> took a disciple? They must be extremely talented.”</p><p>“She is,” he agreed. “However, I didn’t call you here to discuss her skill. There are several things you need to be aware of, and I would like to ask you to keep an eye on her.”</p><p>Hirschur raised a brow. “I won’t sacrifice my research to play Erwachlehren, even to the disciple of my disciple.”</p><p>“I’m not asking you to, but…” He told her about Rozemyne’s backstory, how she was raised in the temple, nearly kidnapped by a noble from Ahrensbach, adopted by the archduke, and then poisoned by Ehrenfest nobles, causing her to sleep in a jureve for a year.</p><p>Hirschur blinked in surprise and then gave a dry laugh. “I see why you’re seeking my assistance. Just how far behind is she?”</p><p>“Academically? Not at all. In fact, she’s far ahead of first year coursework. She’s also working diligently to make up for her shortfalls regarding socializing. What I’m concerned about is the instructor from Ahrensbach.”</p><p>At her questioning look, he explained, “The noble who tried to kidnap her was Count Bindewald. The devouring soldiers used in the attack that led to her poisoning were also his, and Fraularm is related to him.”</p><p>“Oh, really?” she asked, her brows shooting up. “I see. Well, I’ll certainly keep an eye out, but in exchange…”</p><p>Ferdinand sighed. “I’ll continue fixing your magical tools. Have Rozemyne send them during the winter, but deliver them yourself otherwise.”</p><p>She shook her head, a wicked smirk on her lips. “No, I want you to assist in my research.”</p><p>He paused, narrowing his eyes at her as he tried to figure out what she was planning. They’d looked at the shumils and some of the mana-saving tools and circles Raymond had devised, but they hadn’t done any joint research in the previous weave after he left the academy. “What research?”</p><p>“Oh, I don’t know yet,” she said, waving a flippant hand. “I don’t need any input on my current project, but knowing I have your promise of assistance in the future will open up new possibilities. I want to be able to call on you when I think of a project that will benefit from your expertise.”</p><p>He didn’t like making open-ended promises like this. It left him too vulnerable and forced him to give up too much control. “One project,” he agreed, “but keep in mind I’m not at your beck and call. I can only participate so much as it does not interfere with my duties here.”</p><p>“That’s all I can ask for. Now, let’s look at these tools.”</p><p>Three days later as Ferdinand was seeing Hirschur off, he felt his stomach sink with dread as he braced himself for Rozemyne’s lecturing once she caught the smell of potions lingering about him.</p><p> </p><p>As Flutrane’s waters gave way to Leidenshaft’s heat, Rozemyne’s mood plummeted, though her training with Elvira helped her hide it admirably. Ferdinand felt he could do nothing for her since he was the cause of her misery, so he instead arranged for her to go to the Linkberg Estate following the Starbind Ceremony where she could receive as many hugs as her and Elvira’s schedules allowed. In the meantime, he had a special project to complete between managing the temple work, training Hartmut, and tutoring Wilfried and Charlotte.</p><p>A couple of weeks after Rozemyne left the temple, Ferdinand received an invitation to celebrate her tenth year.</p><p>Upon being shown to the dining hall at the castle, he found Rozemyne in a shin-length dress, smiling demurely as she greeted him. He offered his congratulations and engaged in idle chatter with the adults as the children talked excitedly amongst themselves.</p><p>After dinner came time for gifts. From all her relatives, she received high-quality fabric, embroidery thread, an ornately crafted ink and pen set, plant paper pressed with summer flowers, an assortment of supplies for the Royal Academy, and books on feyplants, feybeasts, battle strategy, and magic circles.</p><p>Whenever it came time for Ferdinand’s gift, Rozemyne opened it and gasped. Inside the box was a similar hair ornament to the one he made in the previous weave, though this one had seven rainbow feystones hanging from mana chains as well as smaller stones embedded along the metal shaft itself.</p><p>“Each stone has protective magic circles, so you’ll be well-protected whenever you wear it.”</p><p>“It’s beautiful,” she said, picking it up and admiring it. “Rihyarda, please put it on for me.” As she passed it to her attendant, he caught Sylvester’s level stare, but Ferdinand only shrugged. It was just a hairpin.</p><p>Once it was in place, she turned her head and asked, “Does it look good?”</p><p>“Of course it does. I made it.” He knew that response would annoy her, but he didn’t know what else to say in front of all these people.</p><p>Honestly, he expected Rozemyne’s and Elvira’s looks of disappointment, but not Sylvester’s and Florencia’s, too. Karstedt and his sons merely shrugged it off as Bonifatius boomed that the hairpin suited his beautiful granddaughter.</p><p>When the gathering came to an end, Ferdinand went to his workshop at his estate to work on another of his projects and not at all to avoid his older brother.</p>

<p>After Ferdinand and Rozemyne returned to the temple, Elvira flew over for lunch like usual, but when it came time for her and Rozemyne to leave for her ladies’ education, Elvira sent her on, saying she would be along in a moment. Once she and her retainers were gone, she passed a sound-blocking tool to Ferdinand, who took it with trepidation.</p><p>“Lord Ferdinand” she said, her glistening black eyes giving him a sense of foreboding, “with how easily you write lyrics and sing songs that call Bluanfah for any woman graced to hear them, you will surely understand my surprise that you seem so deprived of the blessings of Grammalatur.”</p><p>He furrowed his brows as he recalled the look of disappointment she’d given him at the dinner celebrating Rozemyne’s tenth year. “Would you have me speak of spring to a child?”</p><p>Elvira sighed and lowered her eyes. “No, I would have you praise my daughter. Instead of commenting on Efflorelume’s blessing as she wore your gift, you instead praised your skill in crafting it.”</p><p>“I had no such intent.”</p><p>“You know as well as I that intent means little in communication.”</p><p>Furrowing his brows further, he crossed his arms and said, “Should I have spoken my mind? That it shone like stars against her midnight-blue hair? That I hope it will protect her in my place when I cannot be by her side?”</p><p>Elvira’s eyes sparkled as pink dusted her cheeks. “Yes! That is indeed what you should have said!”</p><p>“She’s a child.”</p><p>“And what is wrong with telling a child she is beautiful and that you wish to keep her safe?”</p><p>She had a point, but just the thought of having said that at dinner made him uncomfortable. Sylvester had already shown his disapproval of the gift itself. He couldn’t imagine what his brother’s reaction would be to such words.</p><p>Even if they had been alone, he didn’t think he could have brought himself to say them. He feared they would sound as if Bluanfah danced for him when he truly only saw her as a child under his protection. Rozemyne had memories of being an adult, and while she didn’t understand romantic love, she understood enough to be disturbed by any romantic overtures from a grown man to a child not yet enrolled in the academy. The last thing he wanted to do was cause her to distance herself from him.</p><p>Still, he did not want to have another of these conversations again. “Very well. I shall…praise her more.”</p><p>“I ask that you do.” With that, Elvira took her leave.</p><p>That afternoon, two of Wilfried’s retainers fled from their training in tears.</p><p> </p><p>That summer, Rozemyne took Lieseleta as an attendant and expressed interest in Leonore, who’d of course been recommended by Cornelius, though she would have to wait for winter socializing to extend the offer. When she mentioned Philine, Ferdinand sent Justus to investigate her simply to say that he did. Two weeks later, he made an appointment to meet with Elvira.</p><p>After the taste-testing and pleasantries were out of the way, he gave her a sound-blocking tool and said, “I need to speak with you about one of Rozemyne’s potential retainers.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>“She’s a laynoble who’s formed a bond with Rozemyne in the winter playroom over a shared interest in stories. I believe she’ll make an excellent, trustworthy scholar for her station, much like Damuel as a knight. However, in my investigations, I discovered something…troubling.”</p><p>“Oh, my. Do we need to separate her from Rozemyne altogether?”</p><p>Ferdinand shook his head. “No, but we discovered that Philine’s father married into the family, and her mother passed, meaning Philine is the rightful heir and will inherit upon her coming of age. However, her father took a second wife who is now bearing Guduldh’s burden, and she has started treating Philine and her unbaptized brother less than favorably.”</p><p>“I see,” Elvira said. “The second wife hopes to make her child the heir even though there are no grounds to take the position from Philine. An untrustworthy water goddess truly does poison the spring.”</p><p>“That is far from my main concern,” Ferdinand stated. “I’m worried about how Rozemyne will approach this. You know how she is with children, and if she were to take Philine as her retainer and hear about the boy’s circumstances…”</p><p>“I understand.” She placed a troubled hand on her cheek and sighed. “I do hate to deprive her of what sounds to be a budding friendship.”</p><p>Ferdinand shook his head. “I do not wish to bar Philine from service. Rather, I would like you to use this as a learning experience for Rozemyne. Guide her in handling the situation as the daughter of the archduke would. She’s likely to hear about the brother’s situation regardless at this point. All we can do now is use it to our advantage and help Rozemyne grow.”</p><p>“Then I shall make the necessary preparations.”</p><p> </p><p>Before the summer Coming-of-Age Ceremony, Ferdinand was called to a meeting with Rozemyne, Sylvester, Florencia, Karstedt, and Elvira. The combination should not have surprised him as much as it did. After all, Elvira was privy to nearly all the most sensitive information regarding Rozemyne, and Florencia had regularly been hosting tea parties for the three of them and Charlotte to further their ladies’ education.</p><p>That was only possible because Rozemnye’s education required her to spend more time at the Linkberg’s and the castle. He realized with some chagrin that Florencia’s absence in her life was largely in part due to his attempt to keep her in the temple where she was most comfortable. While Rozemyne had far fewer chances to relax in the temple this weave, she was becoming more and more comfortable at the Linkberg estate where she could act like family with her brothers and seek out her mother for physical affection. As he was unable to provide that support in this weave, he was both grateful to and strangely jealous of Elvira, only because he wanted to know she thought of him as family.</p><p>Once he arrived, he found Wilfried in attendance as well, sitting alongside Rozemyne. Perhaps the meeting wasn’t going to be as dire as he’d thought.</p><p>“Alright,” Sylvester said, leaning forward on his elbows, “Rozemyne, why don’t you explain why we all needed to gather here?”</p><p>She gave a delicate smile and moved her hand gracefully as she said, “We need to discuss what trends Wilfried and I will spread this winter. Depending on what they are, I will need to send word to my exclusives to begin preparing samples for distribution at the very least.”</p><p>“I see,” he said, leaning back in his chair. “What would you suggest?”</p><p>Rozemyne brought her hand to her chin as she thought the question over. “I believe we should hold back on picture books and karuta. I would like to maintain an edge over the other duchies with our grades.”</p><p>“What about rinsham?” Wilfried asked. “It spread quickly throughout the duchy, and it seems no one can live without it anymore. Plus, it won’t give anyone an advantage over us. It will just increase interest in our exports.”</p><p>Ferdinand narrowed his eyes with surprise. Perhaps all the time he spent tutoring the boy had made a difference in this weave, even if he was more focused on raising Charlotte to be the next archduchess.</p><p>“Yes, I think that’s a good idea,” she said, gracing her brother with a completely undeserved smile. “I imagine someone may discover how to make rinsham from the samples we distribute, but there are parts of the process that will be difficult to reproduce without the right knowledge.”</p><p>“So they may be able to mimic it, but it won’t be the same quality,” Sylvester said.</p><p>Florencia smiled as she brought a hand to her own hair. “I must say, it is an excellent product. I can’t imagine it wouldn’t cause a stir. How quickly can it be manufactured? Would we be able to easily sell it to other duchies this coming spring?”</p><p>Rozemyne tilted her head, causing the feystones on her hairpin to give a pleasant jingle. It truly did pair well with Tuuli’s flower hairpins. “I believe summer would be more feasible as the ingredients are not as readily available in the winter, and we want to ensure we still have enough for our current customers in Ehrenfest. We won’t be able to produce enough to sell to all the duchies, but I imagine we could cater to at least a couple. I would need to speak with my contacts to determine anything further.”</p><p>Sylvester nodded. “Very well, Rozemyne, you’ll spread rinsham to the girls. Wilfried, you can spread it amongst the boys.”</p><p>A disgusted expression flitted across the boy’s face for a brief moment. “Isn’t it more…”</p><p>“Dear brother,” Rozemyne said, turning on him a dangerous smile that he did deserve, “do you not use it yourself? We simply need to have samples with masculine scents prepared.”</p><p>“It’s still kind of embarrassing…”</p><p>Karstedt laughed and said, “True, such a trend is quite different to what you’d expect a future knight commander to spread. What do you suggest, then?”</p><p>Holding his chin in his fist like his father often did, Wilfried closed his eyes as he slipped deep into thought. “We get schtappes our first year, right? Maybe I can teach people how to make it look like a cool sword like Ewigeliebe’s.”</p><p>“Fool, you cannot mimic a divine instrument simply by wishing for it” Ferdinand said. “Besides, you will not learn how to turn it into a weapon until second year. You will only be taught how to turn it into a knife, a brewing stick, and a pen.”</p><p>“Oh,” he said, disappointed. “Well then, how about that game you made with the tiles that flip over? It’s pretty good for thinking about strategy in a different way from gewinnen.”</p><p>“Not bad,” Karstedt said, giving him an approving nod.</p><p>Rozemyne put a troubled hand on her cheek. “While I agree with the premise, I worry that it’s too easy to duplicate. It won’t serve to create an export for Ehrenfest.”</p><p>“Hmm… That’s true,” Wilfried agreed, crossing his arms. Suddenly, his face lit up as he sat forward. “What about sweets? I know they’re your recipes, Rozemyne, but couldn’t you spread your cake and I spread cookies? I think poundcake would work well for girls’ tea parties since all you’re physically doing is sitting there eating and drinking. Cookies would be great, though, when playing gewinnen since you can eat it and play at the same time.”</p><p>“Would that not give me two trends and you only one?” Rozemyne asked.</p><p>He shrugged. “I can still play reversi with people, and if it ends up getting copied, people will still know it originally came from Ehrenfest. Besides, I’m not too worried about how many we each have. I’m not going to be the next aub, anyway, and you said you just want to run the library. I think my time would be better spent worrying about Charlotte and Melchior rather than how much I stand out.”</p><p>Florencia gave him a warm smile as Sylvester’s mouth pulled into a tight line. Even after this long, he still couldn’t let go. “I think that’s very kind of you to think of your younger siblings,” Florencia said. “I also agree that the sweets and the game would be good trends for you to spread during your first year at the academy.”</p><p>“What about the printing industry?” Rozemyne said. “I would not like to tip our hand, but it’s so drastically different from anything else that I think it would be best to start catching people’s interest.”</p><p>“By what means?” Elvira asked, pausing from taking notes as Rozemyne’s head scholar.</p><p>“Well, how about we have students use plant paper? They can pay for it by transcribing and gathering information. We can also lend out the books about knight tales and Mother’s <em>Royal Academy Stories.</em> Oh, but we should only lend out one at a time. If we have multiple in circulation, then people may get together to compare them and realize they’re printed rather than transcribed.”</p><p>As Rozemyne talked about books, her noble facade fell more and more until Elvira politely coughed, bringing her back from the brink of mania. Her mask in place once more, she placed a delicate hand on her cheek and asked, “What do you think, Sylvester?”</p><p>He hummed to himself for a moment before looking to his little brother. “What do you have to say about it, Ferdinand?”</p><p>Ferdinand tapped his temple, recalling how things had transpired in the previous weave. He didn’t remember any issues arising from the use of plant paper or the lending of books in particular, save Rozemyne’s tendency to lose consciousness or act in a manner unbefitting an archduke candidate, but neither of those should pose a problem this time. “I think it’s a good idea.”</p><p>Her face lit up as she beamed at him in the most inappropriate manner. Would this girl ever learn to hide these extreme emotions? He couldn’t imagine what would happen were she to show such a face in front of others once she started tying her hair up.</p><p>“Very well, then,” Sylvester said. “Rozemyne, I trust you’ll handle placing the orders for everything?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Wilfried sat forward. “I know Rozemyne’s the one who has to do that, but shouldn’t I be doing something, too? It’s not fair to pile everything on her.”</p><p>Florencia, Sylvester, and Ferdinand all blinked at him in surprise, though for different reasons. Had this useless waste of mana ever actively sought out work on his own or offered to take some of Rozemyne’s burden without being prompted or manipulated?</p><p>“Well, uh…” Sylvester trailed off, unable to think of a task for the boy.</p><p>“Rozemyne will be returning for the Dedication Ceremony during the term. You can handle the distribution of products and socializing while she’s gone.”</p><p>Wilfried’s eyes widened. “Wait, can’t I participate, too?”</p><p>“Oh, but…” Rozemyne gave him a troubled look befitting a noble of her station. “You see, you have to be ordained as a priest to be able to take part in the Dedication Ceremony. There’s a magical barrier that prevents anyone else from entering the room to protect the chalices.”</p><p>“Then ordain me,” he said, causing everyone to freeze in shock. “I already do the spring and autumn ceremonies. I can help with the winter one, too.”</p><p>Sylvester leaned forward. “Now hold on a minute here. Do you know what you’re saying?”</p><p>Wilfried nodded. “I’m saying I, as an archduke candidate, should help supply the duchy with mana. Have you been to the temple, Father? There are very few blue-robed priests, and they don’t have much mana at all. That means Rozemyne and Uncle Ferdinand are providing the majority of the mana. I think I should help, too.”</p><p>Just where was this sudden sense of responsibility coming from? It couldn’t have been his tutoring alone. Did working with the Knights’ Order with the intent to become Knight Commander instill that strong of a sense of duty in him? Was he just overly protective of his siblings now after spending so much time training under Bonifatius?</p><p>Maybe this was simply what Wilfried could have been had he been given a decent head attendant rather than Oswald.</p><p>“While I would welcome the assistance,” Ferdinand said, “would it not be better to have at least one archduke candidate present in the dormitory?” He didn’t bother to mention he’d need to finish his coursework before the dedication ceremony. He’d done so with admirable grades in the previous weave. Under Ferdinand’s tutelage, he was bound to do the same this time as well.</p><p>“I could come back on days when we don’t have any socializing scheduled,” he said. “Or we could simply schedule tea parties and the like for after the Dedication Ceremony. There would still be plenty of time to socialize before and after, and I could always go back in the case of an emergency. Besides, our other students can help spread trends, too, after Rozemyne and I get them established, so it’s not like everything will come to a standstill while we’re gone.”</p><p>“It’s admirable that you want to help,” Florencia said, “but will you not be troubling your retainers by leaving all the work to them? They may not be finished with their own coursework by the time you would need to leave, making the burden of your absence that much greater.”</p><p>Wilfried looked pained as he sat back in his chair, deflated.</p><p>“What if you came for a week?” Rozemyne offered. “Even that much would be a great help, and I’m sure our retainers could handle the dormitory for that long. After all, Hartmut is being trained by Ferdinand himself, so he’s more than capable of leading the dorm in our absence.”</p><p>Ferdinand’s chest swelled with pride at her confidence in him, though it was to be expected. He didn’t suffer fools or wastrels. “I believe that would be a fair compromise.”</p><p>With a wide grin, Wilfried turned to his parents. While Sylvester seemed to be fighting a headache, Florencia smiled and said, “Yes, that should be fine.”</p><p>“And next year,” the boy said, getting so excited that he bounced in his chair, “Charlotte and I can trade off!”</p><p>“Wait, you want Charlotte to become a shrine maiden, too?” Sylvester asked.</p><p>Karsted shrugged. “Why not? My daughter was one before she became High Bishop.”</p><p>“Ngh… That’s true. It’s just…” Sylvester sighed, scratching his head. “It’s going to be hard to find marriage partners for them while they’re part of the temple.”</p><p>Slightly scrunching his face in confusion, Wilfried said, “But you appointed Rozemyne High Bishop. Wouldn’t it be just as hard for her?”</p><p>Sylvester laughed, waving the question off. “Nah, not with all her recipes and inventions. We’ll be chasing the suitors off if anything.”</p><p>And she was already engaged, of course.</p><p>“I guess that’s true,” Wilfried said. “That just means me and Charlotte will have to step up our game! I’m not going to let anyone look down on us!” He puffed out his chest with pride, which prompted Rozemyne and Karstedt to offer him compliments.</p><p>Compliments he didn’t deserve, of course. Anyone could state lofty intentions. None of what he said would matter until he proved he could follow through with his promises.</p><p>When they were dismissed, Elvira shot Ferdinand a look, and he sighed inwardly. As they stepped out of the office, he said, “Rozemyne…”</p><p>“Yes, Ferdinand?” she replied, looking up at him with those large, moon-like eyes, her hairstick tinkling as she moved.</p><p>“You…you did well. Good job.”</p><p>Her face lit up as she broke into a silly grin. “I got a Good Job from Ferdinand! Ehehehe!”</p><p>Elvira’s warm smile quickly died as he said, “Fool! Don’t show such a shameless face in front of others.”</p>

<p>Right before the Coming-of-Age ceremony during one of their regular lunches, Rozemyne called Fran over and announced, “Ferdinand, I have a gift for you per our agreement if you would be so kind as to accept.”</p><p>Elvira gave her a nod of approval as Fran passed some documents to Gido, Ferdinand’s attendant in the temple, who inspected them and then presented them to Ferdinand. He looked at the top page and found it to be sheet music for a song with a simple arrangement. Rozemyne likely wanted to leave him room to modify it further. He hummed a few bars to himself before nodding. “Is this your summer song?”</p><p>“Yes, in honor of Anwachs who blessed me while I slept.”</p><p>“I see,” he murmured, flipping the page to find the lyrics. It was a good piece overall, and he was excited to start working on it. “As per our agreement, then, you’ve earned half a day in my library.”</p><p>She’d already taken the full day she was rewarded for memorizing the geography and history content before the meeting discussing trends. Since he needed to be present when allowing visitors into his home, he’d spent that day in his workroom off to the side, creating items he’d need for future projects.</p><p>“I thank you ever so much. Fran, please check my schedule to see when I’ll next be available to go to the library.”</p><p>It was decided that she would come the Fruitday after the Autumn Baptism.</p><p>The ceremony came and went, and soon enough, Rozemyne was at his door directly after breakfast, her eyes alight and fingers twitching with the urge to no doubt pour out blessings.</p><p>They exchanged greetings before her attendants and guard knights followed her into the library, where she promptly took a book from the end of the first row and began to read.</p><p>Just like last time, he went into the workshop and closed the door behind him. Sitting down at his desk, he grabbed the red thread from one of the nearby boxes and started to dye it. When he finished, he placed it with the white thread he’d completed during Rozemyne’s last library trip. He then grabbed the wooden stick he’d discreetly purchased from the Gilberta Company and carved magic circles into it before hiding them with a decorative design.</p><p>The circles did nothing impressive; they would simply compare the mana of any man who touched the ornament to that in the thread used for the flower decorations. If they didn’t match, the offender would receive a rather uncomfortable jolt, similar to the defenses worked into the library shumils. He never expected it would ever be activated, but if she were ever attacked, it might buy her some more time.</p><p>That completed, he put the stick in the box with the thread and had it prepared to be delivered to Tuuli, who was waiting to craft the hairpin.</p><p>He debated whether he should add small feystones she could use to simulate dew like he’d seen on some of her designs in the previous weave, but he ultimately decided against it. Sylvester would undoubtedly disprove.</p><p>Truly, ensuring Rozemyne’s protection was becoming a challenge with all the restrictions he was made to suffer.</p><p>Lasfam called him to lunch, startling him out of his reverie. He ate with Rozemyne where they chatted about what she’d read, which happened to be some of Heidimarie’s books on feyplants. None of the ones she read about had been among the ones she’d promised to help him research, which only intrigued him more. Yet another reason to greatly anticipate her coming of age.</p><p>Once they finished their meal, they started their tutoring session. What began with customs of other duchies naturally led to ditter, which led Eckhart and Justus to step forward and start telling tales of his past games. While he wanted to order them into silence, Rozemyne’s face was lit with an eager interest as she asked more and more questions about the strategies he’d used and the social outcomes of his exploits.</p><p>Well, he didn’t see the harm in allowing her a little diversion.</p><p> </p><p>“And that is how Lord Ferdinand won his blue cape!” Eckhart said.</p><p>“Oh, so that was the story! Mother had told me that he’d won it during his time at the Royal Academy, but I never learned exactly how.</p><p>“Still, I find it a little difficult to picture some of these stories since I have no frame of reference for them.”</p><p>Ferdinand tapped his temple for a moment before he pulled some parchment from one of his shelves, spreading it out to reveal his ditter map. “This is the Royal Academy.”</p><p>“Ah, this map brings back memories,” Eckhart said with a nostalgic smile.</p><p>“Where’s the library?!”</p><p>Ferdinand pointed it out and then showed her where Ehrenfest’s dormitory was.</p><p>Eckhart pointed to a small circle in the forest and said, “This is a shrine that Grandfather broke during one of his ditter games when he was young.”</p><p>Rozemyne blinked at him. “Did they fix it?”</p><p>“Yes,” Ferdinand answered.</p><p>“So are all four of these little circles shrines?”</p><p>“Yes, though…” At his prompting, Justus produced a pen and jar of ink, allowing Ferdinand to mark the locations of the other two shrines. “These are shrines to each of the seven gods?”</p><p>“But there are only six.”</p><p>Ferdinand placed a finger on one of the circles. “Ewigeliebe’s shrine also holds Geduldh’s within.”</p><p>“Wow, whoever made them really went for biblical accuracy,” she said, leaning over the map. “Is this drawn to scale?”</p><p>“Yes. Why?”</p><p>“It’s just that they’re placed in a perfect circle around the Academy with equal distance between them. It’s almost like they planned all of it around the gods rather than school.”</p><p>Justus nodded. “There is a chapel there as well, so perhaps they did.”</p><p>“Hmm… So I guess it got repurposed at some point. Anyway, who are the other shrines dedicated to?”</p><p>Ferdinand listed them out, and then when her questions slowed, Eckhart stepped forward again and used the map to explain the strategies to her once again. Judging by the looks on their faces, it was an excellent bonding moment between the two. He was glad his guard knight had accepted her as his little sister, even despite knowing the truth. It gave Ferdinand some sense of relief that he could trust him to protect her not just as a part of his duty but as family.</p><p>The following day, Wilfried and Charlotte came to the temple to be ordained as a priest and shrine maiden, respectively, and Rozemyne beamed with pride all the while. They all had lunch together where Rozemyne introduced “mousse,” a strange, fluffy dessert that left an unpleasant coating on the tongue, though the children seemed to like it. He tried to hide his distaste for it, but as always, his betrothed saw right through him, the slight pout at the corner of her lips indicating her disappointment.</p><p>Wilfried and Charlotte left with their attendants to get changed out of their ceremonial robes before heading back to the castle, leaving behind their scholars to help with paperwork. This left Ferdinand and Rozemyne more or less alone since Elvira didn’t teach her on Earthdays.</p><p>“Ferdinand,” she said, bringing a hand to her cheek as she looked at him with a mixture of worry and shyness, “might I speak with you privately?”</p><p>Fran indicated that he would be present as well, so Ferdinand brought along Gido and met with her in the High Bishop’s chambers.</p><p>She began by apologizing that the dessert was not to his taste, but he waved it off. “I’m not one for sweets, as you know. Don’t feel discouraged by my particular palate.”</p><p>Somehow, that did not alleviate any of her concern.</p><p>At a loss for what to do, he decided to change the subject. “What did you wish to discuss?”</p><p>“I-I have a gift for you,” she stammered, waving a graceful hand at Fran, who passed a box to Gido. His attendant did the customary checks for poison before he passed it to his master.</p><p>Ferdinand opened the flat box and froze. Inside was a handkerchief, the fabric of which was the same color as his hair. His name was embroidered in midnight blue on one of the corners, and the edges were done in golden filigree. In the center was an impressive magic circle done in a mixture of the blue and gold. Running his mana through it proved it to be fully functional.</p><p>It was a circle that called for Schlaftraum’s blessing along with a simple protection spell. She had gifted him the ability to have a safe, peaceful night’s sleep.</p><p>“Very fine,” he said, a smile on his face.</p><p>Rozemyne sighed with relief and then flushed with pleasure as she giggled, “I got a Very Fine! The highest form of praise!” When he glanced at her, she quickly tried to school her features, though she couldn’t entirely erase the grin. He wished she’d let that dazzling joy stay a little longer as they were effectively alone, their attendants politely looking away.</p><p>“Um, Mother’s been teaching me embroidery, and I went through several handkerchiefs before I had one good enough to give you. She and Hartmut helped design the magic circle, so I can’t take full credit for it, but I’m glad you like it. I worked really, really hard on it.”</p><p>His heart pounded as he realized just how much reading time she’d sacrificed for this. He folded it and tucked it away in his robes, fully intent on using it when he retired for the evening. “I’ve never received something so fine,” he admitted, feeling his ears warm.</p><p>She reached up and touched her hair ornament with a sweet smile on her face, silently returning his words to him.</p><p>He was going to have to make her something truly phenomenal in return.</p><p> </p><p>All too soon, the Harvest Festival came. Things moved much faster with four members of the archducal family involved. Wilfried was still largely confined to riding carriages since his lion-shaped highbeast was perfectly normal, but Charlotte had modeled hers after her sister’s, though thankfully it was a shumil instead of a grun. Since she was able to ferry all the grey-robed attendants with her, she was given some of the more remote areas of the central district to visit while Rozemyne handled the area surrounding Hasse. Ferdinand went with her as his district happened to be just beyond hers, and she would need to pass the chalice to him, anyway. It was simply more efficient.</p><p>He followed her to greet her true father, though she was giving Ferdinand concerned looks all the while. When Gunther saw them, he froze, his jaw dropping as he took in his daughter’s new appearance. After a moment, he along with the rest of the soldiers knelt, and he turned a smile to both of them. “High Bishop, High Priest, we are honored by your presence.”</p><p>“Gunther, I hope you and your family have been well,” Rozemyne said. “Many seasons have passed since I last saw you.”</p><p>“Yes, we’ve been doing fine. I’m happy to see you fully recovered and looking healthy, High Bishop. I know my family will be just as happy when I tell them.” She gave him a warm smile, and then he said, “I must tell you that the High Priest was most diligent in seeing to our needs during your absence.”</p><p>She blinked and turned her gaze up to Ferdinand.</p><p>“He took care of the soldiers and allowed my daughter to go to the orphanage to learn etiquette, which has allowed her to start serving noble customers at the Gilberta Company. You will surely be surprised by her growth the next time you meet.”</p><p>“Yes, I’ll be ordering more hairpins soon, so I will be seeing her before long. As always, please take care of my grey priests, and be safe.” Rozemyne passed him a large silver and gave each of the soldiers accompanying him a small silver.</p><p>As she made her way down the line, Gunther looked at Ferdinand and said, “Thank you for looking after the High Bishop during her recovery. Knowing you were watching over her put all of our hearts at ease.”</p><p>“Think nothing of it,” Ferdinand said. “We will pray for a safe journey. I wish you and your family well.”</p><p>Gunther gave a soldier’s salute, which Ferdinand responded to with a stiff nod. He stood with Rozemyne as they watched the caravan depart.</p><p>As he turned to form his highbeast, Rozemyne grabbed his sleeve and looked up at him. “Thank you.”</p><p>He gave her hand a quick pat. “Of course. I keep my promises.”</p><p>Sometime after they returned to the temple, Rozemyne presented him with a song dedicated to Schutzaria. It was artfully arranged with lyrics that thanked him for protecting those she held dear, though to an outsider it would simply appear to be prayers offered to Schutzaria who protected Geduldh.</p><p>When he thanked her for the piece, she smiled at him and said, “I keep my promises, too.”</p><p> </p><p>All too soon, the autumn Coming-of-Age Ceremony came and with it went the last of their peaceful days together. The commoner Winter Baptism flew by in the blink of an eye, and before he knew it, he was performing the nobles' Winter Baptism without Rozemyne as she would be participating in the gifting ceremony.</p><p>As the day dragged on, he kept stealing glances at Rozemyne, catching her doing the same more than once. She seemed nervous, but that was to be expected. Other than a slightly-higher-than-normal pulse, he was perfectly fine. He had no concerns about the announcement itself since she’d already agreed to the engagement. What caused the dread roiling in his stomach was having to face the aftermath.</p><p>Well, at least he wouldn’t have to “socialize” among the single adults anymore.</p><p>Once the debuts finished, Sylvester started the gifting ceremony, giving each new student a cape and brooch. There weren’t that many, so it seemed no time had passed at all when Sylvester called out, “I have some important announcements to make. First,” he waved to Ferdinand, who met him on stage, “I will be reinstating Ferdinand as Knight Commander once he finishes training his replacement for High Priest.”</p><p>The members of the Knights’ Order cheered louder than was strictly acceptable, drowning out the polite applause from the crowd.</p><p>Sylvester held up a hand to silence everyone. He then gestured towards Rozemyne, who took a steadying breath, put on a noble smile, and walked so gracefully she practically floated up to the stage to stand next to Ferdinand. He scanned the crowd, noticing similar reactions to her engagement in the past weave. Count Leisegang’s eyes widened in excitement then disbelief as he put together why Ferdinand’s return to the Knights’ Order was announced first. Countess Dahldorf eyed the two of them, her hand covering her mouth, while Gerlach actually appeared shocked, though not unhappy.</p><p>Of course, Ferdinand’s departure from the temple meant they were successfully removing an obstacle preventing Georgine from taking the foundation, whether that pawn knew it yet or not. Hopefully, that would keep Ahrensbach from interfering with him, but he wouldn’t rely on it alone. He would need to make other moves to ensure no one separated him from Geduldh.</p><p>Sylvester announced, “The mighty King and Queen of the endless skies, the gods of Dark and Light, have guided Dregarnuhr the Goddess of Time to weave two threads together, here and now. May the meeting of my adopted daughter Rozemyne and my brother Ferdinand be blessed, and may they be graced with divine protection.”</p><p>Just like last time, it was the standard engagement announcement, and once again, buzzing filled the air as the crowd tried to figure out what this meant. One Liesegang elder began yelling that this was a slap to their faces, that he was removing their princess from the running for aub. Another cried out that this guaranteed her position. Someone from the Former Veronica Faction said that Ferdinand was trying to steal the seat of aub, just as Veronica had always warned. Across the room, a man claimed Sylvester was putting the Leisegangs in their place.</p><p>He didn’t hear what other absurd things they shouted as he had quickly escorted Rozemyne out of the hall and followed Justus and Rihyarda into a side room.</p><p>The two of them sat on a small couch against the far wall as Eckhart and Damuel took up positions outside. Justus and Rihyarda, meanwhile, started preparing tea.</p><p>“That was utter chaos,” she groaned, holding her head in her hands. It relieved him to see she was still the same Rozemyne underneath her carefully crafted noble persona and to know she didn’t show this side of herself to just anyone.</p><p>“That much was to be expected,” Ferdinand replied as he waved Justus over. He immediately stopped what he was doing and came to stand beside his lord. “Thankfully, you’ll be in the winter playroom and then the Royal Academy, far away from these foolish adults.”</p><p>She glared up at him, giving him a rare show of her less extreme emotions. “But you won’t be. You’ll have to deal with them alone.”</p><p>“I’m used to it.”</p><p>“But you shouldn’t have to!” she said, turning to fully face him. “I’m officially your fiancé now. I should be facing this with you, but…” Rozemyne bit back her words and looked away. “I’m sorry I can’t help you. I’m sorry you have to do this alone.”</p><p>Ferdinand called her name twice, but she refused to look at him, so he brought his fingers to her chin and made her turn towards him. “You don’t have to be sorry. It’s my duty to protect you. There is nothing to feel guilty about.”</p><p>“We should be protecting each other!” she pouted.</p><p>He smirked at her. “I will look forward to it, then, when you’re older.”</p><p>Her eyes widened as she took in a deep breath to start berating him, but Rihyarda gave a sharp cough, drawing his attention to the fact that he was still touching her face. He immediately dropped his hand and cleared his throat before taking the parcel Justus had been holding. “I had hoped to give you this under happier circumstances, but here.”</p><p>Rozemyne took the box from him, causing her attendant to sigh with resignation as she skipped the typical checks. She took off the lid and gasped.</p><p>Inside was a necklace made with metal forged from his mana, spun into an intricate leaf pattern that surrounded the largest rainbow feystone he owned. Several smaller feystones adorned the chain, each bearing a magic circle. The main feystone itself was engraved with his name and crest, the significance of which she understood thanks to Elvira’s education. Next to it was the hairpin he’d commissioned from Tuuli, made with red and white flowers that would stand out beautifully next to her dark hair.</p><p>“Oh, Ferdinand, this isn’t fair!” she said. “I didn’t know we’d be doing this right now. Rihyarda, please send for it!”</p><p>Her attendant obviously knew what “it” was as she immediately stepped out of the room to send someone for Ottilie before she returned to finish preparing and serving tea.</p><p>While they waited, Rozemyne passed the necklace to him and brushed her hair to the side. “Put it on me, please!”</p><p>“Of course,” he said, slipping it around her neck and closing the clasp. The necklace hung a couple of finger breadths below her collarbone, the perfect height to draw the eye, especially when placed against a black dress. Even her cape wouldn’t cover the stone. “Make sure you wear it outside your clothes,” he said.</p><p>She tilted her head at him. “But I thought…”</p><p>“That won’t be necessary any time soon,” he said. Not that they would ever need to grow used to each other’s mana since she was already dyed in his colors. It was far more important to let everyone know she was already engaged.</p><p>With a nod, she looked down and brushed her fingers over the feystone. “It truly is beautiful. I thank you ever so much, Ferdinand.”</p><p>“Yes, well… You’re welcome.”</p><p>She shot him a knowing grin before having Rihyrada replace her current flower hairpin with the new one. Her attendant raised her brows as she picked it up and glanced at Ferdinand before doing as her mistress asked. He’d have to explain later that the mana she’d felt was merely another protection circle. Truly, he couldn’t be too careful with his fiancé.</p><p>She turn in her seat, showing off the new hair ornament. “How does it look?”</p><p>His heart leapt into his throat as he threw quick glances at the other room’s occupants. Rihyarda was still giving him a look while Justus was covering his mouth as his shoulders shook. Elvira’s harsh words replayed in his mind, but once again, he felt uncertain he should express his true thoughts.</p><p>Unsure what to do, he settled for staying the truth as simply as possible. “Beautiful.”</p><p>He was saved from having to elaborate further by Ottilie knocking on the door and entering with a sizable box.</p><p>“Oh, good! It’s here!” Rozemyne cried, jumping to her feet. Not a moment later, she realized what she’d just done and demurely took her seat again. “Ferdinand, I have a gift for you as well.”</p><p>Ottilie passed the box to Justus who began to give the customary checks but hesitated when he opened it. He bit his lips to fight back his grin as he closed the box and passed it to his lord. With nerves fluttering in his stomach, Ferdinand lifted the lid and gaped at what he saw.</p><p>“Well?” Rozemyne said. “Pull it out and look at it!”</p><p>He did so, letting the ochre cape unfurl, revealing the midnight blue embroidery that trailed along the edges and pooled at the bottom. Intertwined in the decorative design were riesefalke feathers, rairein flowers, ruelle fruits and flowers, and wavy stripes that likely represented the schnesturm they hunted for her winter ingredient. They worked to obscure several protective magic circles of varying strengths. In the center of the cape was his coat of arms embroidered in light blue and gold. Brushing his fingers over the fine stitches, he felt her warm mana gently pulsing through the thread.</p><p>“It’s…it’s not complete,” she said, scratching her cheek. “I plan to add more circles to it, but I want to learn more about them first so I can pick them out myself. That won’t be for a few years, though, so… A-Anyway, I’ll have to ask for it back at some point in the future so I can add to it. I… I hope you’re not disappointed…”</p><p>“No,” he breathed, still staring in awe at the cloak. “I am far from disappointed. This… This truly is…” Words failed him as he continued taking in every detail of the embroidery. How many hours did she forego reading to devote to embroidering his cape?</p><p>This…this surely meant he was part of her Geduldh now, right? She had put this ahead of <em>books</em>. She wouldn’t do that for anyone she didn’t deem family.</p><p>Justus finally stepped forward and offered to help him put it on. Ferdinand immediately got to his feet, feeling the weight of the world fall with the blue cape before Rozemyne’s gentle mana enveloped him in warmth as Justus fastened the new one in place. “Rozemyne, this is… This is very fine indeed.”</p><p>He didn’t chide her for her open, honest smile as he was sure that, just for a moment, he’d shown her one just as shameless.</p>

<h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
<p>I was ecstatic when I was selected to serve the Saint of Ehrenfest. All my patience in waiting for her to wake and my many attempts to have my mother recommend me were finally rewarded. Of course, I would gladly do much, much more to be able to toil on her behalf.</p><p>The training Lord Ferdinand put me through was rigorous but rewarding, knowing that every lesson brought me closer to fulfilling the tasks he laid upon me for her sake. And what a glorious day that would be to see the plots at last come to fruition!</p><p>I had responded to various requests from her, mostly small things like gathering information on potential retainers and helping her design magic circles for Lord Ferdinand’s handkerchief and cloak - not that she told me those were what they were for, but what kind of scholar would I be if I could not piece together the intended recipient of a circle beckoning protection and sleep? There was also only one reason she’d be asking for them before she even started at the academy - she was embroidering something for her yet-unannounced betrothed.</p><p>At first, I wasn’t sure if he was truly deserving of the role, but the more I learned about him, the more convinced I felt that if anyone could stand next to the Saint, it was he. He was the shadow to her light, the vengeance to her mercy, and the only one truly capable of directing her energies where they would be most effective. I would perhaps prefer someone kinder to soothe her fragile heart, but no one was perfect.</p><p>It was early autumn when Lady Rozemyne and Lady Elvira approached me with the beginnings of a plan truly worthy of a saint. My heart was moved when she explained her grief over young Philine’s situation and the treatment of her brother. To think though I had been barred from witnessing the mercy she showed to orphans with my own eyes, I would yet be blessed to see her extend it even to unbaptized laynobles! She stood to gain so little by getting involved; after all, the girl was not yet her retainer, but surely she would fall to her knees in worship of Lady Rozemyne’s magnanimity! I certainly was ready to.</p><p>As we worked out the finer details, I witnessed a cold, calculating side to my mistress that I had never even suspected existed. Whether or not this was an innate sense of judgment or influence from her future god of darkness, I could not say, but I was moved nevertheless.</p><p>The plan began upon her arrival at the winter playroom after the announcement of her and Lord Ferdinand’s engagement. I had sadly missed her triumphant return as I’d stayed behind in the grand hall to observe the ugly chaos and gather information on the movements of our enemies.</p><p>Once I entered the playroom, I found Lady Rozemyne taking her rightful place as she directed the children, forming them into groups based on age and course rather than faction. Truly, even I had missed the sense of camaraderie that had never spread to the academy and faded without her presence. It was as if such pure goodness could not exist without her light.</p><p>“Now, before you begin playing with the new games, karuta, or numbered cards, I would like to give out payments for the information you diligently collected during my absence. Different information was found useful by different leaders in Ehrenfest, and your payment was determined by its value to the purchaser. Now, let’s begin with Brunhilde. Thank you for your information on fashion and trends. My mothers both found the information extremely helpful when designing my wardrobe upon my awakening.” She continued down her list, personally thanking each person and letting them know what made their information valuable where appropriate.</p><p>When she called Roderick’s name, unease settled over the room as the Leisegang and Former Veronica Faction children exchanged tense glances. He timidly stepped forward and upon seeing his payment did a double take. “I-I’m being paid the same as everyone else?” he gasped, astounded by Lady Rozemyne’s unprecedented generosity.</p><p>“Of course,” she said. “Was your information not just as valuable? Was it not for the betterment of Ehrenfest that you so diligently gathered it even when the workings of Chaocipher kept back the blessings of Flutrane? Factions have no relevance in my eyes as we are all children of Ehrenfest.”</p><p>The mercy of the Saint was truly a glorious sight to behold!</p><p>From the corner of my eye, I saw Wilfried cross his arms as he looked on with a furrowed brow, but he and Charlotte had already been made aware of how she planned to distribute payment. It was a valuable lesson for him as he would surely be leading knights of all factions if he ever became Knight Commander.</p><p>Which I doubted would happen since the lord of my lady would soon be filling the role, and anyone worthy to stand next to her would never be usurped by the likes of Wilfried.</p><p>I looked around the room and took in the expressions and body language of the Former Veronica Faction children. Right away, I picked out three that would be easily swayed, but my primary target was cautiously observing, still unwilling to form an opinion either way.</p><p>Once all payments had been delivered, Charlotte called for the return of borrowed materials while Wilfried began explaining the rules of the new history- and geography-based games and my lady introduced the new picture books designed to help with these oft-unstudied subjects. Moritz observed carefully, clearly in awe of her blessings from Mestionora.</p><p>The excited buzz eventually settled down, allowing Lady Rozemyne to take to her corner to read. Before long, Roderick gathered up his courage and approached her. “Um, Lady Rozemyne?”</p><p>“Yes, Roderick?” she asked, gracing him with a saintly smile.</p><p>“Um, I just wanted to say that… I was ever so grateful to see the stories I told you in the collection that was sold while you were sleeping. Seeing them written down and being able to read them again and again gave me much comfort when I needed it.”</p><p>“Oh,” she said, placing a worried hand on her cheek, “I am ever so glad you found joy in reading the book, but I’m worried that you felt a need to seek comfort in those pages. Are you well, Roderick?”</p><p>He blushed in embarrassment and turned his eyes to his feet. “Um, I… I can offer no complaints about the way I’m treated, Lady Rozemyne.”</p><p>Her expression changed just slightly, showing a hint of the pain his words caused her delicate heart. “Roderick, I hope you know that I value your stories greatly and indeed hold high expectations for your future in writing. I would very much like to keep receiving your works in the future.”</p><p>“Y-you truly feel that way, Lady Rozemyne?”</p><p>“But of course,” she said. “If lack of materials is proving to be a barrier, I would happily deduct the cost from the purchase price of your manuscripts. This is a similar system to the one I plan to implement at the Royal Academy.”</p><p>He glanced away again. “That… That would indeed be helpful. I thank you for your kindness.” With that, he left to go join a game with Matthias and Laurenz. They were older than he was, but they’d taken him under their wing, so he often sought them out for protection.</p><p>Just one more light push, and we’d have him.</p><p>Next, Philine made her way over, gushing over the new books and thanking her for preserving her mother’s stories.</p><p>“Of course,” Lady Rozemyne grinned. “Please share with me any other stories you remember.”</p><p>“Well, there are several that I’ve forgotten parts of,” Philine replied, deflating slightly.</p><p>“Then might I suggest collecting stories at the Royal Academy?” When Philine looked up, Lady Rozemyne explained, “I think you’ll find that many tales follow the same story beats, and collecting more may help you recall what you’ve forgotten.” As always, my lady was generous with her ingenious advice.</p><p>She clapped happily. “Oh, what a wonderful idea! I… I couldn’t help but overhear what you said to Roderick. Is it true you’ll be offering to deduct the cost of materials from the payments? Is this offer extended to everyone?”</p><p>“Indeed,” Lady Rozemyne nodded. “Actually, Philine, if you have a moment, I would like to speak with you. I will be gathering others as well, but would you be able to step to the side when Leiseleta calls for you?”</p><p>Philine blushed as all eyes turned on her, their intense stares making her quiver. “Y-y-yes, but of course, Lady Rozemyne.”</p><p>As planned, she’d approached her laynoble first, signaling to any future retainers the value she placed in the girl to prevent them from looking down on her. I’d expect nothing less from my lady!</p><p>Throughout the morning, Lady Rozemyne approached Brunhilde, Leonore, and Judithe as she came into contact with them in the course of her rounds. She gave a meaningful look at Roderick but ultimately did not invite him to the meeting. His honor was preserved, however, since she’d only selected female retainers.</p><p>After lunch, Lady Rozemyne met with each of the girls separately with me attending as her scholar and Rihyarda and Leiseleta as her attendants. Naturally, they all happily accepted her offer. Since she called them by order of rank, Philine was the last one she saw.</p><p>“Before you leave, Philine,” Lady Rozemyne said, “I have a book that I wrote to give to my siblings’ younger brother to enjoy while Wilfried is away. I hear you have a little brother near his age, so I was wondering if you would do me the favor of reading this to him and letting me know his thoughts.”</p><p>Philine’s eyes widened at the weighty responsibility given to her, but she knelt and crossed her arms over her chest. “I would be honored to be trusted with this task, Lady Rozemyne.”</p><p>Good. Good. I had decent material to work with. Between her understanding of my lady’s majesty and her desire to bend to her will, I saw great potential to mold her into a scholar worthy of the Saint of Ehrenfest.</p><p>“Ah, and here,” she said, gesturing to Rihyarda who handed Philine a piece of magic paper and a mana pen. The pen itself was nearly useless to someone with so little mana, but it would serve perfectly for our purposes. “I am giving these to my retainers who do not yet have schtappes. This paper will act as an ordonnanz. Simply write your message on it and fold it closed. It will then fly to me. I ask that you keep these two items hidden on your person at all times when feasible. Not only are they valuable, but I would like to know that if you ever find yourself in a situation where you need to contact me, you’ll be able to do so with the speed of Steifebrise.”</p><p>“I…I thank you ever so much, Lady Rozemyne,” Philine said, tears in her eyes.</p><p>I wondered if she realized she was my lady’s only retainer without a schtappe.</p><p>The next morning, Lady Rozemyne and her siblings arrived in the playroom and immediately got to work organizing the children into their groups for their morning games. As everyone’s attention fell to the cards before them, Lady Rozemyne cast her gaze about the room and said, “Oh, I thought I was mistaken at first, but I do not see Philine among the children. Have I perhaps missed her?”</p><p>“No, my lady,” I said, stepping forward and bowing slightly. “She has not come to the winter playroom this morning.”</p><p>She furrowed her brow and frowned at her head attendant, who briskly came to my lady’s side. “Rihyarda, is it not customary for children to come to the playroom every day?”</p><p>“It is,” she conceded, “though a variety of reasons may keep them away, such as illness or an emergency in the family.”</p><p>“I see. I do hope it’s nothing serious.”</p><p>She moved about the room, occasionally joining in a game when she felt the winners were getting too complacent, and checking on everyone’s progress with Moritz and the harspiel instructors. When winners were announced, she directed Brunhilde, Leiseleta, and Rihyarda to distribute their prizes - the cookies we planned to debut at tea parties in the academy this winter. This allowed even students who had no other means to obtain the cookies to taste them so they would at least be able to answer questions about them. It did not ensure every student was able to try one, but those who won were quick to brag about the flavor and texture, so it was all the same as far as I was concerned. Anyone unable to afford them would not be able to provide them at parties regardless.</p><p>About mid-morning, a white bird flew through the window and settled on the book Lady Rozemyne was reading before dissolving into a folded piece of paper. She blinked in surprise and opened it. As her eyes quickly scanned the contents, her brows slowly came together in concern. “Rihyarda,” she called, passing the letter to her, “please summon Mother and Damuel. I fear I will need them both this morning.”</p><p>“At once, my lady.” She glanced over the letter as she left, her eyes nearly bulging at what she found.</p><p>I fought the urge to smirk.</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne, what’s wrong?” Cornelius asked as he came to stand beside his sister. Truly, life was so unfair. Why would the gods waste their time blessing Cornelius with the same blood that flowed through the Saint of Ehrenfest’s veins if he were going to deny her divinity? How could he be graced with so much time with her and walk away thinking she was only a cute but problematic little sister?</p><p>With a troubled sigh, Lady Rozemyne closed her book and got to her feet. “I will wait for Mother to explain, but I fear I may have to leave the castle for a brief visit elsewhere.”</p><p>“What? But it’s so cold outside! You shouldn’t be out in this weather.”</p><p>Well, at least we could agree on that, but needs must.</p><p>She turned her divine gaze upon her brother and said in a quiet voice only those right next to her could hear, “Yes, I imagine that’s why they made coats, Dear Brother.”</p><p>He gave her a tight grin that promised retribution in the near future, which she met with a sweet-as-honey smile. Truly, her dark god’s influence was becoming ever more pronounced.</p><p>Leonore and Angelica took up posts next to her while we waited. It wasn’t long before Rihyarda returned, leading the entourage into a meeting room where Lady Elvira and Damuel waited.</p><p>“Mother, Damuel, my apologies for calling you so abruptly during winter socializing.”</p><p>“Think nothing of it, dear,” Lady Elvira said, “but do tell, what has caused you to send for us so abruptly?”</p><p>With a troubled hand on her cheek, Lady Rozemyne said, “I fear Ordoschnelli has brought ill tidings this morning. I entrusted to my newest scholar yesterday a book of considerable value in order to obtain an honest opinion on it before it was sent to print. However, a letter I received this morning suggests a Chaocipher within her home has stolen my book and refuses to let my retainer leave in order to serve me as she should.”</p><p>Lady Elvira covered her mouth in a small gasp. “Oh my! That someone would dare to steal from the archduke’s adopted daughter! What would you have us do, my lady?”</p><p>“As you know, I care greatly for my books, and I feel exceedingly uneasy when I fear they have been mistreated. Other than Rihyarda and Hartmut, my retainers have not seen what my book looks like, but even they would not be able to discern at a glance if any pages had been removed or other such damage had occurred. I would like to retrieve it myself, if only to settle any debate over the state of my property upon discovery.”</p><p>With a troubled sigh, Lady Elvira gave a defeated nod. “I see. Then I see no reason to stop you.”</p><p>“Thank you, Mother. Brunhilde, Judithe, Leonore, and Rihyarda, I apologize, but I must ask you to remain here. Rihyarda, I’m trusting the winter playroom to you in my absence.”</p><p>“Yes, my lady,” the four of them said, though the three girls looked slightly disappointed.</p><p>“Damuel, I ask that you ride with me for my protection. Leiseleta and Mother, please also join us in my highbeast since you are not currently wearing riding clothes. Cornelius and Angelica, guard us. We’re going to Philine’s residence.”</p><p>It was only now that I regretted not being born a woman. What I wouldn’t give to ride inside my lady’s magnificent highbeast!</p><p> </p><p>When we arrived, Cornelius knocked on the door, and soon after, Jonsara’s attendant answered. Her eyes bulged at the sight that greeted her, and she managed to stammer something to the effect of, “What can I do for you, my lord?”</p><p>He stepped to the side as Lady Rozemyne strode forward, offering a perfunctory greeting. “I’ve come to speak with Philine. Might I ask as to her whereabouts?”</p><p>“I-I’m afraid sh-she’s indisposed, my lady.”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne gave a small, disappointed sigh, her sad eyes closing as the last hope of extending her mercy died. “Cornelius.”</p><p>On command, he pushed into the house, causing the attendant to screech as she fell back. Damuel entered next, followed by Lady Rozemyne, Lady Elvira, Leiseleta, myself, and Angelica, who kept her hand on Stenluke’s handle as she kicked the door closed behind her.</p><p>“Hartmut. Damuel,” Lady Rozemyne said in her deadly calm voice. “Search the premises.”</p><p>I immediately followed her orders, relishing in witnessing this heretofore unseen side of the Saint of Ehrenfest. She had dropped the veil of mercy and had taken up the sword of justice, ready to cut down any she deemed unworthy.</p><p>The layknight and I glanced into the first room, looking for anything of interest. As we began our search, Jonsara came screeching into the hall, holding her heavily swollen belly. When she saw a knight and archnoble standing before her, she went ghastly pale and ran off. Damuel and I gave chase until at last she came to a stop in what appeared to be her bedroom. Kashick, her worthless husband, came barreling in behind us, ready to visit violence upon the intruders until he got a good look at us.</p><p>While Damuel got to work intimidating answers out of the man, I brushed past the woman and pulled open the dresser drawer she’d been reaching for. As expected, Lady Rozemyne’s book was tucked away within. Sadly, it was in pristine condition, save for some slight indentations where someone’s nails had perhaps dug in. “Damuel, I found Lady Rozemyne’s stolen property.”</p><p>“Wh-what?” Kashick stammered as Jonsara began wailing about her innocence. Thankfully, her unseemly behavior covered the sound of pages tearing.</p><p>As I made my way to the door, Damuel suddenly froze, holding up a hand to silence everyone. His enhanced hearing was obviously picking up something, and he bolted off in the direction of whatever it was. It didn’t matter to me. I’d done what I’d come to do.</p><p>When I came back to the main hall, I held aloft the thread-bound collection of stories. “I have retrieved your book, my lady.”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne thanked me with a cold smile as she took it from my hands. “Where is Damuel?”</p><p>“I’m afraid I cannot say for certain. He seemed to hear something.”</p><p>She raised a hand. “Angelica.”</p><p>“Yes, my lady!”</p><p>The blue-haired dolt leapt into action, sprinting down the hall and disappearing from sight. A cry of disbelief echoed from somewhere deeper in the house. Soon after, Damuel’s voice, deepened by anger, reverberated down the hall as he shouted, “Get out of the way!” There was then a thud, possibly Angelica thinking faster with her hands than her brain.</p><p>Oh, well. Kashick and Jonsara weren’t long for this world, anyway.</p><p>Damuel came barreling into the main hall, Philine in his arms, wrapped in his cloak. Her cheek was heavily bruised. Behind her, Angelica was carrying the little brother, his wide eyes glistening with unshed tears.</p><p>Lady Elvira stepped forward and saw to the children as Lady Rozemyne inspected her book. Her entire body locked up as she stared at the remains of the pages that had unfortunately been torn. “How… How could they…?”</p><p>Hmmm… It seemed I didn’t need to worry too much about her acting. Her despair and rage were all too real. Anyone would be convinced that this was the purpose of her sudden intrusion and the reason behind her next actions.</p><p>“Angelica, let Mother and Leiseleta attend to the child and Philine. Go with Cornelius and bring to me the ones responsible for this crime.”</p><p>Moments later, Kashick and Jonsara were dragged into the room and forced down on their knees. Lady Rozemyne stepped forward, the pendant around her neck taking on a shine as her anger continued to grow. “You have not only stolen from me, but you committed the unforgivable sin of tearing the pages out of one of my books.”</p><p>“No, my lady, I–”</p><p>Cornelius shoved the woman’s head down, growling between clenched teeth, “Lady Rozemyne did not permit you to speak.”</p><p>“I trust you know what the punishment for taking and damaging the property of the archduke’s adopted daughter is.”</p><p>My spine tingled as I watched her magnificent display. To see her so thoroughly destroy her enemies, all for her love of children and books. Truly, my eyes could barely stand to behold the sight! She was no longer merely a saint. No, she was a goddess!</p><p>“Cornelius, remove them.”</p><p>“Wait, Lady Rozemyne!” Philine said. “It was Jonsara who took the book from me, not my father.”</p><p>“Oh?” she asked, turning to look at the girl, searching her grass green eyes for something I couldn’t quite grasp. Perhaps when she looked into a person’s eyes, she was able to see into their soul. I would expect nothing less of my goddess! “Philine, is my understanding correct that this house belonged to your mother, and that your father married into the family?”</p><p>“Yes, my lady.”</p><p>“Are you the rightful heir to this family?”</p><p>“Yes, my lady.”</p><p>“And is it true that, strictly speaking, your father has no legal claim to the house, save that he is acting as your guardian until you come of age?”</p><p>“...Yes, my lady.”</p><p>“Then is it not his responsibility as guardian to protect that within your house? Is he not culpable not only in your mistreatment but in the theft and vandalism of my personal property?”</p><p>Philine glanced over to her father, but whatever she was seeking, she didn’t find it. With the sparks of indignation burning in her determined glare, she said, “Yes, my lady.”</p><p>“Cornelius, remove them from my sight.”</p><p>Jonsara started pleading, begging for the Saint of Ehrenfest’s mercy for her unborn child, but Lady Rozemyne responded, “If you wish me to consider the fate of your child, you may turn them over to the temple orphanage as I am both the High Bishop and Orphanage Director.”</p><p>That the gods were so good as to allow me to witness this glorious sight! My lady was dazzling both in her grace and her judgment!</p><p>Cornelius hauled the pair outside, sending up a rott to summon assistance with either transporting or executing them. At Philine’s urging, Damuel retrieved the little brother’s magic tool, which was apparently Philine’s mother’s heirloom. I exchanged a look with Lady Elvira. We both knew that if the situation were allowed to fester, Jonsara would have reregistered the tool to the baby she carried.</p><p>Once Philine held the heirloom in her trembling hand, Lady Rozemyne asked, “Philine, do you have any family members on your mother’s side who would be willing and able to act as your guardian until you come of age?”</p><p>She blinked rapidly, trying to keep her tears of joy at bay as she said, “Yes, my mother’s cousin, Isberga. She was going to serve as my attendant at the Royal Academy.”</p><p>“I am ever so relieved to hear it. Now, allow me to offer you this.” She stepped forward and gave both Philine and the brother blessings to heal their wounds before ordering Leiseleta to take them to their bedrooms and help them dress. They would be staying in a room at the Linkberg estate until Isberga could retrieve them.</p><p>Watching the healing filled me simultaneously with awe and a deep, dark envy. I would have to find a way to receive Lady Rozemyne’s blessing for myself.</p><p>When we eventually returned to the castle, I laid eyes on Matthias and prepared to set the next plot into motion.</p>

<p>Ferdinand returned to the grand hall to find it in a state of controlled chaos. The nobles had largely divided themselves by faction where they carried on loud debates over the aub’s intentions.</p><p>On his way to Sylvester, he was stopped by the Leisegang elders. “Lord Ferdinand, do you plan to be the next aub?”</p><p>What fools. “You only need to think of the precedent set by Bonifatius to answer that question.”</p><p>“Then is your plan to make our princess aub?”</p><p>“Is an archduchess not required to marry an archduke candidate because he will need to step in when she is unable to provide mana to the duchy? I don’t know how you would expect someone to fulfill both the roles of Knight Commander and consort at the same time. Imagine the consequences should Geduldh’s burden coincide with the arrival of the Lord of Winter.”</p><p>The thick-headed lord’s face darkened as he said, “So you did intend to remove her from the line of succession.”</p><p>At least in this weave when Rozemyne voiced her support of Charlotte at one of her tea parties with her mothers, she knew what she was saying. “She herself has declared her intention to support Charlotte, or haven’t you heard?” He knew in fact that they had since Elvira, Hartmut, and Leberecht had ensured the information was spread throughout the Liesegang faction. To say otherwise was to admit their information gathering skills were so poor they didn’t even know what was being said among members of their own family.</p><p>Ferdinand said no more on the subject, and as he moved towards the far end of the hall, he gave more or less the same answers to those brave enough to stop him. Giebe Gerlach and Viscountess Dahldolf watched him from the edges of the room, their eyes calculating.</p><p>Would they put off the plan to steal the key to the bible until he left the temple? Or would they still implement it when everyone was gone? Would Georgine still push for the marriage of two of their nobles into Ehrenfest now that he would no longer be blocking the path to the foundation?</p><p>He worried that they would use trug to convince the zent to force him into Ahrensbach anyway just to remove him from the equation all together. Even with his plan to return to the Knights’ Order and Rozemyne’s public support of Charlotte, their right to the seat of aub remained, meaning Georgine might see him as a threat no matter what he did.</p><p>His knowledge of the previous weave would only help him marginally in this. So many variables had changed that it was highly unlikely any of what he remembered would occur again. Even the part that affected him most had been catalyzed by an ill-timed visit to the Royal Academy Library, and he had no intention of repeating that mistake.</p><p>Sylvester sighed as Ferdinand finally reached him. “Well, this is a mess.”</p><p>“We knew it would be.”</p><p>“Doesn’t make it fun to deal with.”</p><p>“So now you have an idea what it’s like for me to clean up after you.”</p><p>Sylvester scowled at him and took a deep draw from his goblet. “Well, I suppose I’ll make my rounds. Hopefully, things will settle down once the shock has worn off.”</p><p>Karstedt followed the aub as he mingled with the crowd while Ferdinand stayed with Eckhart at the far end of the hall. It didn’t take long for off-duty members of the Knights’ Order to swarm him, offering congratulations and celebrating his return by telling him stories of his exploits before he went to the temple as though he hadn’t experienced them himself. Eventually, they moved on to theorizing how future trombe and feybeast hunts would differ with his return as if he didn’t still participate in them. They then started bemoaning the fact that the difficulty of their training would increase by at least ten fold, which only annoyed him. Had Karstedt slacked off that much? Perhaps that was why their apprentice knights had lacked any form of coordination before Rozemyne got involved.</p><p>Dealing with the rowdy men was tedious, but at least they served to keep the other nobles at bay. Many threw him furtive glances, but none dared approach.</p><p>The next day, he was once again surrounded by knights, though a different set than before as they’d switched shifts. Their shielding was not as necessary this time as this room of fools had finally grasped that Charlotte was now the one most likely to inherit her father’s title. While she would never surpass Rozemyne, her participation in religious rituals, command of a malleable highbeast, and ability to call forth Schutzaria’s Shield a full year before her debut at the Royal Academy forced everyone to acknowledge her skill. Had Rozemyne not entered noble society, she would be the hope of Ehrenfest.</p><p>Charlotte’s lack of connection to the Leisegangs would prove to be an issue, however, if Sylvester did nothing to address it. Alas, Brunhilde was far, far away from proposing to his brother, and he’d only accepted out of desperation to control the rampaging faction as Ferdinand recalled. Of course, he hadn’t been present for the event, so he only had second-hand information to extrapolate from.</p><p>Sometime close to midday, Rihyarda entered the hall and quickly made her way to Elvira and Damuel. <em>Ah, so it’s starting,</em> he thought, smirking slightly. Rozemyne was finally learning how to navigate noble society and plot to get what she wanted. Hartmut had worked well with what he was given in the previous weave, but it was still clumsy and heavy-handed.</p><p>The plot she devised this time would serve many purposes. First, she wouldn’t have to separate Philine and her brother. Rozemyne valued family above all else, and while she had saved the boy’s life in the first weave, it had pained her to do to them what Ferdinand had effectively done to her.</p><p>Second, it would signal to noble society that she was no longer the helpless target she had been before the jureve. No one below archnoble status would dare move against her after the story of how she’d had two laynobles executed less than a bell after she discovered their treachery made its rounds. Saint she might be, but weak she was not. Gerlach and his mednoble lot would think twice before launching another attack on her.</p><p>Third, it would show the Former Veronica Faction children that she didn’t hold the crimes of parents against their children and that she would ensure the wellbeing of anyone who came under her merciful wings. He doubted her name sworn retainers would have to be strong armed into swearing fealty to her this time.</p><p>Fourth, and of least concern to him, Jonsara’s infant, whose mana was supposedly higher than Philine’s brother’s, would be joining the temple if she chose to live in captivity until his birth, giving them yet another source of mana, meager as it might be. It would surely be more than what the current blue priests could provide. Ferdinand didn’t know what happened to the boy in the previous weave, but he imagined he died since Philine’s family didn’t have the funds to purchase another tool, and they’d supposedly already sold off anything of value.</p><p>Elvira eventually returned and discreetly passed him a sound blocking tool to deliver a brief report. At the end, she sighed and said, “I never thought I would see such a look in her eyes. To be honest, it made Schneeahst’s ice trail down my back.”</p><p>Ferdinand couldn’t fight the grin that brought to his face.</p><p>Later that evening, as he approached the playroom, one of the guards on duty stepped inside. A moment later, the door opened to reveal Rozemyne, her sparkling eyes showing the joy her polite smile dared not. The courtship necklace glimmered proudly at her breast, its prominence declaring she already belonged to him.</p><p>
<em>Let’s see how that fool boy enjoys her whirling when one of her glowing feystones bears my name.</em>
</p><p>“Ferdinand,” she called, gliding forward. “What has brought you to the playroom this evening?”</p><p>“I came to escort you to dinner.”</p><p>She blinked at him for several moments, her face unchanging, causing him to bite back a sigh. Really, he had gone out of his way to come see her after what was surely a stressful day. In the previous weave, it would have sent her flying into his arms. Had he worried over her for no reason?</p><p>“I am honored,” she said at last, stepping forward and placing her hand in his. It was only his second time escorting her in this weave, and it was obvious she was still unaccustomed to it. Admittedly, it had been much easier for her when she was grown. It would likely take a few more years before she grew enough to compensate for the height difference.</p><p>As they walked, he slipped a sound blocking tool between their hands, holding the other in the hand resting on his belt. “I heard about how you executed your plot this morning. You did well.”</p><p>Her grin broadened, causing him to admonish her. “It’s your fault,” she said, not changing her face in the slightest. “You’re the one who praised me in public.”</p><p>“Oh? Then as we are unable to be alone, I shall refrain from offering any more praise.”</p><p>“No! Praise me! Praise me more!” Though she spoke like her true self, she only showed a slight frown. Elvira’s training had worked wonders.</p><p>“How are you feeling? Today must have been hard on you.”</p><p>“They tore my book.”</p><p>“And you would have them executed for it? You truly lose all restraint when books are involved.”</p><p>Rozemyne came to a sudden halt in the hall, startling everyone. Several of her retainers called out to her, but she didn’t respond. Instead, she stared at Ferdinand, her face drained of color, her mouth agape. “Executed?”</p><p>“...Of course. What did you suppose the punishment is for fools who steal from the archducal family?”</p><p>“I-I-I thought they’d be put in prison or maybe the White Tower, and we’d use their mana or…or…”</p><p>He quickly pulled out a feystone and held it to her forehead. “Calm yourself! Letting your mana run rampant will only hurt your retainers!”</p><p>“I… I… I can’t! Ferdinand!” Tears poured down her cheeks as she reached trembling hands towards him, her eyes wild with panic. The sound blocking tool rolled across the floor, coming to a stop against his foot.</p><p>Rihyarda and Cornelius both reached out to her, their faces pale with shock.</p><p>“No!” Ferdinand barked as he pulled out another feystone. “Stay back!”</p><p>She filled three stones nearly as fast as he could place them on her and still her eyes began to swirl with color. He quickly covered them, placing a hand on the back of her head to keep her from stepping away. “Rihyarda! Ask Elvira to come to Rozemyne’s room!” She gave a quick nod and started rushing down the hall.</p><p>Ferdinand leaned down and spoke into Rozemyne’s ear, telling her to keep her eyes closed, before he swept her up in his arms and spun to march to the nearest window.</p><p>“Wait!” Cornelius called. “You can’t–”</p><p>“Can you not see this is an emergency? Her mana is about to rampage! <em>Stop wasting my time!</em>” When he reached the window, he threw it open and summoned his highbeast as he leapt out. He sped towards her bedroom, holding her as tight as he dared as she sobbed. In the dark, each of the feystones she wore gave a soft glow.</p><p>
<em>What is the point of hiding them if you’re going to reveal them the moment you get too emotional?</em>
</p><p>It only took a few moments to reach her room. He entered through the window, pressed her hand to the feystone of her hidden room, and went inside.</p><p>“Rozemyne, you must control yourself.”</p><p>She shook her head as she gripped his cloak and buried her face in his chest. “You don’t understand!” she cried. “I-I set her father up and then condemned him <em>right in front of her!</em> No, worse than that, I <em>forced her to agree to it!</em> I only thought about saving her and her brother. I didn’t think I was… I was…” The rest of her words were lost to her bitter weeping.</p><p>Ah. This was not the Rozemyne who led an army into another duchy, orchestrated an attack on foreign ships, and stormed the Gerlach mansion, nor was this the Rozemyne who’d chosen to become a tool for the royal family to find Grutrissheit in order to save him from execution by association.</p><p>This was the Rozemyne who had wrapped herself in her father’s cloak after witnessing the deaths of traitors in Hasse, who would nearly break all social decorum to save an unbaptized laynoble she’d never met, and who would fight the aub to save even the children of those who tried to kidnap and poison her. This Rozemyne, who valued family and life to an unmeasurable degree, had just condemned a father to die in front of his children. It did not matter to her that he had allowed his wife to abuse them, nor that he would have let his son suffer an agonizing death.</p><p>How had he deluded himself into believing a couple of seasons of social training would change that?</p><p>…If only she had been there to save <em>him</em> when he was a child.</p><p>He closed his eyes and chased away the useless thought. “Rozemyne,” he said, “I was told that Philine was resolute in agreeing to his punishment. Was she not?”</p><p>“She was, but–”</p><p>“Did she cry or seem melancholy as you took her to the Linkberg estate?”</p><p>“No, but–”</p><p>“If she does not even grieve for her father, why do you? It makes no sense.”</p><p>“Feelings don’t have to make sense!” she yelled, gripping his cloak tighter.</p><p>He sighed, unable to think of how to comfort her as he stroked her head, a gesture he’d heard she offered as a reward to some children. “Rozemyne, even if he had been locked in the White Tower,” which he absolutely wouldn’t have been, “Philine would have never been able to see him again. I fail to see how the result is any different.”</p><p>“It is different! I can’t see my… Tuuli’s mom anymore, but I know she’s alive! I can keep going knowing that she’s alive!”</p><p>The light at the door came on, and Ferdinand stood with Rozemyne in his arms and opened it for Elvira.</p><p>“Oh, my!” she gasped as she slipped into the room and closed the door. She then sat in one of the chairs and held out her arms. “Quick, give her to me.”</p><p>He sat her down on her mother’s lap, but as he went to stand, her grip on his cloak tightened. “Rozemyne, you have to let go.”</p><p>Her eyes, red, swollen, and desperate, bore into his, pleading for something, but he could not fathom what. When Elvira patted her arm, she slowly let go and cast her gaze down as she collapsed into her mother.</p><p>Ferdinand explained what had gotten her into such a state, and she sighed and patted her back. “Oh, my dear, dear girl. This is my fault. I should have made sure you understood when we made this plan so you could prepare your heart.”</p><p>A pang of jealousy cut Ferdinand as he beheld the sight of a loving mother. Really, he was a man long grown. How long would he allow this to continue hurting him?</p><p>Though it was shameless, he waited for Elvira to tell him to leave. Even as she let Rozemyne cry and whispered words of kindness to her, she didn’t dismiss him. At first, he thought she had simply forgotten his presence, but then she looked up at him and gestured for him to take a seat nearby.</p><p>“My dear Rozemyne,” she said, “let’s not waste any more tears on that odious man. Instead, let’s focus on the good. If you had done nothing, what do you suppose would have happened to that boy?”</p><p>“He… He would have been hurt more.”</p><p>“Indeed, he would have. Think of what you saved him from.</p><p>“Did you know that I received word earlier that he was happily eating the recipes you made? He said he’d never had anything so delicious. I honestly can’t wait to hear what he has to say about your sweets!”</p><p>Ferdinand watched in silent awe as Elvira wove her words into the most beautiful lie, letting the fabric of her fable wrap around Rozemyne like a warm embrace.</p><p>Once Rozemyne had calmed, Ferdinand healed her puffy eyes and waschened away the damage her tears had wrought on both of them.</p><p>“Now then,” Elvira said, clapping her hands together, “shall we have dinner brought to us? Rozemyne, be a dear and tell Rihyarda to set a table for three. I shall be along in a moment once I make myself presentable again.”</p><p>“Yes, Mother.”</p><p>Ferdinand followed her out and escorted her to the table. She sent Rihyarda to retrieve their supper and apologized to her guard knights for her unseemly display. Cornelius sighed with relief and left with Leonore to guard the hall while Damuel and Angelica took up posts in the room. Rihyarda had sent Judithe home as she was young and it was getting late.</p><p>As Ferdinand began to move to his seat, Rozemyne reached out and grabbed his sleeve. He looked down to find her gazing up at him, the echoes of grief still in her eyes. Tapping his temple, he sighed as he tried to determine what she wanted from him. She’d already received more than enough hugs.</p><p>Elvira chose that moment to exit the hidden room, causing Rozemyne to release him. They sat around the table, discussing what her first days at the Royal Academy would be like, how many books were in the library, what toppings she planned to serve with the pound cake, and so forth.</p><p>He never did discover what she wanted from him.</p>

<p>It was time for Rozemyne to go to the academy, so Ferdinand escorted her to the transfer room. She and Wilfried had substantially more luggage this time thanks to all the rinsham, reversi boards, plant paper, and time stopping tools filled with pound cake and cookies. Ferdinand was tempted to instruct her not to give anything to Detlinde, but that idiot would likely take care of that for him herself.</p><p>As her turn approached, a sudden anxiety gripped his heart, and he tightened his hold on her hand involuntarily. She turned her confused gaze toward him, and he forced his body to relax and instead turned his attention to giving her last-minute advice.</p><p>“Rozemyne, remember you must pass all your classes as quickly as possible so you can return for the Dedication Ceremony and go to the library. Be mindful of your mana. You have done well in learning to control the excess you acquired from the jureve, but it’s still too much for you to handle delicately without a schtappe. Try not to offend anyone, especially those in higher ranking duchies, and avoid royalty as much as possible. In fact, keep any interactions with the prince as brief as you can while showing the proper respect.</p><p>“Wilfried, you and Rozemyne both be wary of Ahrensbach. No matter what they say or how they act, remember it was an Ahrensbach noble who tried to kidnap your sister before her baptism and his guards who attacked you.”</p><p>What was he forgetting? “Ah, Rozemyne, when you socialize with people from other duchies, the goal is not to make friends but allies. They will surely be thinking of you as the latter, so do not let your kind, selfless nature mislead you into believing the former. Also-“</p><p>“Pardon me, my boy, but it is time for her to leave,” Rihyarda said, stepping forward and placing a hand on Rozemyne’s shoulder.</p><p>She threw a thankful look at her attendant, which irritated him. Just who did she think he was giving these vital warnings for?</p><p>“Ferdinand, I thank you ever so much for your concern, and I will keep your words close to my heart.” When she turned her bright smile from him, she took the light with her. He had the urge to reach for her, to keep her from going where he could not protect her, but he stood still, instead staring at the hairpin and necklace that would protect her in his place. He hoped they would be sufficient.</p><p>When she stepped onto the circle, he called out, “Don’t forget to send regular reports.”</p><p>Her eyes glimmered with amusement. “Of course, Ferdinand. I will see you again when I return for the Dedication Ceremony.”</p><p>She vanished, but not before he saw the look of surprise and nausea on her face. He should have warned her to close her eyes.</p><p>When Wilfried came to him to say his goodbyes, Ferdinand said, “You’ll need to pass your classes as soon as you can, too, if you plan to come back for the Dedication Ceremony.”</p><p>“Yes, Uncle. I’ll be sure to come home.”</p><p>“Don’t prioritize speed over grades.”</p><p>“Yes, Uncle.”</p><p>“…Keep an eye on Rozemyne. She’s so out of standard that I cannot predict what trouble she will cause.”</p><p>Wilfried smirked. “You’re really worried about her, huh? Don’t be. I’ve trained hard to be able to protect my sisters!” As he turned, Ferdinand heard him mutter, “Good grief… Father was right about him and Rozemyne.”</p><p>He shot a glare at Sylvester, causing him to straighten in surprise. What nonsense had that fool been feeding his son? He wasn’t treating Rozemyne any differently in this weave, so what inspired him to lay false accusations against him?</p><p>He would need to have a talk with his brother.</p><p>Once the last of the luggage had been transported and everyone turned to leave, Bonifatius bellowed, “Ah, I won’t be able to see my cute granddaughter for weeks! This is terrible!”</p><p>For once, Ferdinand understood how he felt.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The first reports from Rozemyne, Wilfried, and Hartmut were as expected. She had organized the dorm by grade and course, uniting the children under one faction as they competed for her recipes.</p><p>However, it wasn’t long before they received the first headache-inducing reports. Hartmut’s was the most detailed as Rozemyne’s neglected to mention anything that might get her scolded while Wilfried’s were more general summaries than anything.</p><p>
<em>Lord Ferdinand,</em>
</p><p>
<em>Today was the fellowship gathering. Lady Rozemyne demonstrated her unrivaled ingenuity by having all students - boys and girls - use the rinsham she brought to spread as a trend. She was the very picture of grace as Lord Wilfried escorted her when they offered their greetings. Of course, she drew much attention due to her stunning beauty, her saintly reputation, her remarkable hair ornaments, her glossy midnight-blue hair blessed by the god of darkness himself, and of course her courtship necklace that puts even Ewigeliebe’s ice to shame.</em>
</p><p>
<em>That boorish, vulgar prince thought to slight our goddess. I have recorded below his exact words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Rozemyne, was it? You are the so-called Saint of Ehrenfest? The rumors claimed you have unparalleled beauty and wisdom, enough mana to be adopted by an archduke, and a compassionate heart that moves even the stoniest of men to tears. How laughable. The only claim with even marginal merit is your meager blessing from Efflorelume. Must such reports always be so untrustworthy?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Her exceptional response is recorded below:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“It is my shame to not meet your lofty expectations, Prince Anastasius, but might these rumors stem from Steifebrise overtaking Mestionora in her eagerness to meet Ordoschnelli?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>He scoffed and gave the following response:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Ehrenfest must think highly of you despite your mediocrity. I can imagine no other reason to chain you to ice so heavy as to ensnare Geduldh.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Her response:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Indeed, my future dark god values me as much as I do him. He is to me Erwachlehren who guides me, Schutzaria who shields me, Heilschmerz who heals me, and Verdraeos who saved me. That he would give me such a beautiful gift brings me much joy.”</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand slapped the letter down on the table and covered his face, his ears aflame. Why the hell would that fool speak of him as though she were at her engagement ceremony in front of the prince?! Did Elvira have her use her romance stories as study materials?!</p><p>“Oh ho?” Sylvester said, leaning over the table and reaching for the letter. “What’s got you all flustered?”</p><p>Ferdinand snatched the paper away, holding it beyond his reach. “Nothing that concerns you.”</p><p>Sylvester smirked as he sat back down and held up another letter. “I imagine it’s a more detailed version of this. Let’s see… Wilfried wrote, ‘Rozemyne must really love Uncle. The prince was mocking her necklace, so she went on and on about him, comparing him to just about every god imaginable. I wanted to die of embarrassment. I guess books aren’t the only thing she goes nuts over anymore.’” He could barely contain his laughter long enough to finish reading the ridiculous report.</p><p>As Sylvester guffawed and banged his fist on his desk, Karstedt tried to hide his snorts of laughter behind his fist. “This is your wife’s doing!” Ferdinand yelled at him. “She should be clearer about the difference between what should be said and what should stay in the pages of her books!”</p><p>“I-I must admit,” Karstedt chuckled, “I’m curious about what she said. Will you share it with us?”</p><p>“Please! Please let me read it!” Sylvester begged between his gasps of laughter. “I’ll do anything! Just let me read it!”</p><p>“Be mindful of your words! You’re Aub Ehrenfest! Don’t make such promises!”</p><p>“Oh gods, it has to be good if you didn’t take me up on that offer!”</p><p>Ferdinand turned away from the pair, muttering to himself, “Just what was that fool thinking?”</p><p>With trepidation, he read on.</p><p>
<em>The prince was rather shocked and disturbed by my lady's effervescent praise of you. I am still amazed by her insight and ingenuity! She undoubtedly saw the look of Bluanfah preparing to dance in the unworthy prince’s eyes and found a gracious way to chase the meddling goddess away! Truly, it was a sight to behold! Never did I think to see my lady so thoroughly and effectively reject a member of royalty in such a manner that they had no room to argue! After all, how could anyone speak of taking a girl so deeply in spring from her dark god?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Still, the prince could not accept his defeat without besmirching her in some manner. He said unto our goddess as follows:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“They say you were adopted to bring order to Ehrenfest, yet you were attacked by nobles from your own duchy. Why would they do this to their oh-so-hallowed Saint?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Her response:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“My deepest, most sincere apologies, but as I have not received the blessing of Mestionora’s wisdom, I am unable to answer this question.”</em>
</p><p>“YOU FOOL!!” Ferdinand yelled, crumpling the edges of the paper in his anger. How?! How had she bungled this so much worse than the previous weave despite two seasons of Elvira’s training?!</p><p>Forget royalty stealing her from him. He would be lucky if she escaped execution!</p><p>Sylvester and Karstedt immediately sobered, then looked over Wilfried’s letter together, trying to find what had triggered such a strong reaction.</p><p>“Oh gods…!”</p><p>“No, she couldn’t have… I must be reading this wrong. ‘She said she didn’t have the wisdom to answer his question.’ That…that was surely just a poor choice of word on Wilfried’s part.”</p><p>Karstedt raised a trembling hand to his head. “Wait, wait, even if it wasn’t, perhaps she spoke so generally that it wouldn’t cause offense.”</p><p>“She specifically referenced Mestionora,” Ferdinand growled.</p><p>After much yelling, fist pounding, hair pulling, and drinking, Ferdinand decided to brave the rest.</p><p>The letter continued:</p><p>
<em>It was as if the prince had seen Ewigeliebe shun Geduldh! When he finally came back to himself, he gave her such a look as to burn the soul and freeze the heart, yet my lady did not waver. Her open, beautiful, innocent gaze forced him to back down and simply dismiss us. Only our goddess could stand against those in the highest heavens and come out so thoroughly victorious!</em>
</p><p>
<em>Lady Eglantine of Klassenberg expressed interest in my lady’s hair, and when she promised her a sample of rinsham, she was invited to tea.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Lord Lestilaut of Dunkelfelger had the audacity to ask our goddess to spin for him so that he might inspect her hair ornament and scrutinize her necklace. Lady Hannalore hurriedly put a stop to his insolence and offered her sincerest apologies. The girl was likewise plied with rinsham in exchange for tea, and Lord Lestilaut tried to get a promise of ditter from “The Lord of Evil’s fiancé,” but she deftly avoided it.</em>
</p><p>Thank the gods for small miracles.</p><p>The letter went on to say Rozemyne had secured tea party invitations from other duchies and then detailed their interaction with Ahrensbach.</p><p>
<em>Lady Detlinde would not even acknowledge my lady, even after Lord Wilfried’s gracious attempts to let her rectify her sin, nor would she use his proper title. She waxed poetic about their familial bond then asked after my lady’s health as though she were not right in front of her. She then tried to extract permission to visit Ehrenfest in the summer, which Lord Wilfried tactfully avoided.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She continued to bat her unremarkable eyelashes at him as though she expected her mediocre looks to carry the weight of the conversation. Of course, she has no other choice as she has no brain to assist.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Truly, if she sought to endear herself to Lord Wilfried, she accomplished quite the opposite. Not only did Lord Wilfried alert everyone in attendance of her brainless sin by subtly moving in front of Lady Rozemyne to shield her, he is now on guard against her and will likely find all manner of excuses to avoid socializing with her. </em>
</p><p>At last, some good news. The rest of the letter described how lower duchies hurled veiled insults at them and how Rudiger hinted at wanting to discuss their mana shortage.</p><p>Despite the constant, concerning praise for Rozemyne, Hartmut's letter conveyed important details and gave a thorough accounting of events. Unlinke Rozemyne's. Ferdinand rubbed his temples as he read hers.</p><p>
<em>To my fiancé,</em>
</p><p>
<em>The fellowship ceremony went well. We got everyone to use the rinsham, and it stirred up a lot of interest. I even received invitations to tea from four of the Greater Duchies because of it. I think we’ll be flooded with buyers once we open the market to other duchies. </em>
</p><p>
<em>The prince was terribly rude to me, but I did as you and Mother trained me to do and responded with vague, polite answers.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Lady Detlinde was just awful. She mostly ignored me the whole time and tried to flirt with my brother. It was kind of gross. Also, I thought you said people from upper duchies would run circles around me if I didn’t learn how to socialize, but Lady Detlinde was way worse than I ever was! Is this how you felt when you talked to me before my training?</em>
</p><p>
<em>No wonder you had so many headaches. I will offer you my sincerest apologies when I return.</em>
</p><p>
<em>— Rozemyne</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand could write an entire book on the things she did not mention. He passed her letter off to Sylvester and then discreetly slipped a particular page of Hartmut’s in his robes.</p><p>When the meeting was over, he went straight to his hidden room, sat at his desk, and pulled out the letter, reading Rozemyne’s words over and over again until they echoed in his dreams.</p>

<h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
<p>Thankfully, Wilfried did not make the same critical mistake as in the last weave by telling Rozemyne she couldn’t go to the library until <em>all</em> first years passed their exams. However, through use of her new study materials and promise of sweets recipes, they still all passed on the first day of their first few written exams.</p><p>Their harspiel class went about the same as before, except this time Rozemyne had pulled Wilfried into a meeting room afterwards and complained that he had “ruined her chance to slack off after suffering through Ferdinand’s brutal training.” Wilfried had evidently told the professors that she had composed the songs she played as well as many more that were dedicated to the gods. She was under the delusion that his outburst was the sole reason she’d drawn the attention of all the music professors. The fool never considered her own skill was to blame.</p><p>Hirschur had wormed her way into the highbeast class, so Fraularm was not able to claim Rozemyne had attacked her when she fainted from seeing her strange highbeast fly. They didn’t even reschedule the class. Hirschur had Fraularm taken from the room and carried on teaching in her stead. The girls ended up copying Rozemyne’s design, though once again, they were primarily shumils, like any normal girl’s highbeast would be.</p><p>The fateful day came when Rozemyne took the first years to register at the library. Like before, her devastation at being denied a tour and her elation at gaining permission to enter caused her to send blessings to Mestionra, the goddess of pettiness, which then gave her mastery over Schwartz and Weiss. At least there was no mention of her trying to force the “library committee” onto Professor Solange; this time she had started by arranging a proper tea party.</p><p>There was one significant difference, however. Rozemyne was now able to pick up on subtle clues she had missed before, as demonstrated by the latter part of her letter, which was dotted with her dried tears.</p><p>
<em>And you won’t believe this, Ferdinand! They executed all the librarians except for Professor Solange! All because they were originally from a losing duchy. How could they?! Professor Solange is providing mana to the library all by herself, and she’s a mednoble. How is she supposed to be able to run a library full of magical tools without any archnobles to help? She said they had had three before the purge!</em>
</p><p>The next part made him wish he could make a transportation circle directly to her hidden room.</p><p>
<em>I’m just so upset by this. I’m having to write this letter in my hidden room because I can’t stop crying. Rihyarda’s already called me twice, trying to get me to go to bed, but I can’t show her my face like this.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I wish</em>
</p><p>Several words were heavily crossed out before the letter ended with, <em>I wish I could see you.</em></p><p>He needed to do something to comfort her, and as he searched for ideas, he remembered the sound recording devices they’d used when they were separated in the previous weave. It didn’t take him long to brew one that would record three messages.</p><p>“Rozemyne, listen to your retainers.”</p><p>“You did well today, Rozemyne.”</p><p>“You’ve worked hard, Rozemyne.”</p><p>When he finished, he laid the tool down and said the fourth message he was unable to record. “You are my Geduldh.”</p><p>Placing the recording device in a leather bag, he set a letter atop it instructing her to only listen to it in her hidden room or all the messages would be lost forever…not that it would actually happen, but it should motivate her enough to keep it hidden. He sent the parcel over that night.</p><p>The next morning, Rozemyne sent him another letter.</p><p>
<em>To my fiance,</em>
</p><p>
<em>Ferdinand, your gift was supposed to make me feel better, so why did you record yourself scolding me? At least the other two messages were good. Now, I can have you praise me as often as I want!</em>
</p><p>
<em>Thank you, Ferdinand. I’m going to work really hard today, so please praise me in person, too!</em>
</p><p>
<em>– Rozemyne</em>
</p><p> </p><p>The day before Rozemyne and Wilfried’s schtappe acquisition, Hirschur sent him a letter.</p><p>
<em>Ferdinand,</em>
</p><p>
<em>Remember our agreement this summer? I have a research project I want your help with. Your fiance has somehow managed to become the master of the library’s magic tools. Be prepared to come to the Ehrenfest dormitory on the day they’re to be measured for their new clothes.</em>
</p><p>
<em>– Hirschur</em>
</p><p>Sighing heavily, he rubbed his temples and cursed himself. In trying to solve the minor problem of Fraularm, he’d created this massive one instead. As an adult, he wasn’t supposed to go to the Royal Academy during the school term except under very extraordinary circumstances. What repercussions would his presence during this pivotal moment have? Could he act as though he’d never seen Schwartz and Weiss’ magic circles convincingly enough to fool Hirschur and Rozemyne?</p><p>No, he couldn’t risk it. He would have to decline.</p><p>
<em>Professor Hirschur,</em>
</p><p>
<em>I have not forgotten, but as an adult, I cannot go to the Royal Academy. I shall review your notes during the interduchy tournament.</em>
</p><p>
<em>–Ferdinand</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Ferdinand,</em>
</p><p>
<em>I don’t know who you think you’re trying to fool. Assisting in my research is a perfectly legitimate reason for you to come to the academy. Do not try to go back on your agreement, or do I need to remind you that your fiance’s classes are not over yet?</em>
</p><p>
<em>–Hirschur</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Hirschur,</em>
</p><p>
<em>I’ll come to the academy, but I refuse to leave the dormitory.</em>
</p><p>
<em>–Ferdinand</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rozemyne had nothing remarkable to report about obtaining her schtappe, meaning she at least didn’t collapse in the Farthest Hall this time. The letters about dedication whirl practice, however, were concerning.</p><p>
<em>To my fiance,</em>
</p><p>
<em>We attended dedication whirl practice today. Lady Eglantine was so beautiful! I think my dance skill increased by twenty percent when I tried to emulate her.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Do you find it odd how no one seems to realize religious leaders were once equivalent to royalty? Or at least, even knowing that, they still think so poorly of the temple? Really, they’re saying a prayer straight from the bible, and they’re wearing clothes that look like our ceremonial robes. Maybe they don’t see the connection because they’ve never been to the temple.</em>
</p><p>
<em>During a break, Lady Detlinde came over and bothered Wilfried. She kept trying to praise him for something he didn’t do, and when he tried to correct her, she just talked over him and, unbelievably, she tried to touch his hair! That’s weird, right? The only time someone my age touches me in public is when Wilfried’s escorting me somewhere, and he’s my brother!</em>
</p><p>
<em>She tried to invite him to a “tea party for cousins” and said I couldn’t come because I wasn’t her cousin, which was fine by me. The fewer connections I have with her, the better!</em>
</p><p>
<em>Anyway, that made Wilfried really mad, so he used the Dedication Ritual as an excuse and told her to hold it with Rudiger instead. I told him later that he probably should’ve taken the opportunity to gather information on Ahrensbach, but he said, “As one of the gray priests likes to say, ‘You can’t get water from a dry well.’ If she can’t even follow the basics of socializing, what makes you think she’d know anything of value?” I don’t think I’ve ever been so proud. My brother really has grown, hasn’t he?</em>
</p><p>That gave Ferdinand pause. This Wilfried was so different from the last weave as to be unrecognizable. If he’d been led to becoming Knight Commander and Oswald had been dismissed earlier, would their engagement have succeeded? Would they have been happy together?</p><p>Ferdinand shook his head. What a foolish thought. If he’d been engaged to Rozemyne in this weave, he would have been set to become the next aub again, erasing all the good pursuing Knight Commander had done. He might even resent her for taking that away from him.</p><p>Dismissing those needless worries, he went back to her letter.</p><p>
<em>The prince was in my class, too. He asked me during the break to see my highbeast before allowing me to join the first years for our whirling practice. I passed in one go! Isn’t that amazing? Didn’t I do good?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Oh, and the prince decided after class that he no longer wished to see my highbeast and left to attend to other business.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I couldn’t go to the library, but Rihyarda let me read a book you sent. Thank you ever so much! Please send me more!</em>
</p><p>
<em>– Rozemyne</em>
</p><p>Sadly, Hartmut was not in the class, so he only had Wilfried’s letter to fill in the gaps Rozemyne purposely left in hers.</p><p>
<em>Uncle,</em>
</p><p>
<em>All of the first years finally finished absorbing their divine wills today. Rozemyne finished hers before dinner last night, and I finished mine right before breakfast today. She’s really something, isn’t she?</em>
</p><p>
<em>I have a few things to report about our dedication whirl class today. First, Lady Detlinde of Ahrensbach approached me. Her information gathering skills seem pretty bad. She tried to praise me, but the only thing she knew about was rinsham, so she tried to say something about me getting everyone to use it. Even when I tried to correct her, she just kept talking. Then, she tried to touch me. I don’t know if she was reaching for my face or hair, but it was really weird. I may have messed up, though, because I instinctively stepped back. She looked insulted, but I couldn’t even apologize because I was too shocked to speak. This isn’t going to create some sort of conflict with Ahrensbach, is it?</em>
</p><p>
<em>She tried to invite me to a tea party for cousins, but she purposely left out my sister. When I pointed that out, she said it was only for blood relatives, which luckily gave Rudiger an opening to join in. Thanks to that, I could tell her to plan the party with him instead because I would be returning to Ehrenfest for the Dedication Ritual.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Uncle, I’m really confused. What is Lady Detlinde trying to do? I can’t figure out what her goal is or if she even has one. I don’t know what she’s trying to accomplish by being so openly rude to Rozemyne or acting like she’s a lot closer to me than she is. I could really use your advice so I know how to handle her. At this rate, I’m afraid I’m going to create an interduchy incident by accident by trying to protect myself and Rozemyne.</em>
</p><p>
<em>The other thing I have to report is Prince Anastasius’ contact with Rozemyne. We really could use your advice on this, too. He called her over and demanded to see her highbeast. It put her in a tough spot because the first years were about to start, but no one could tell him to let her get back to class. If he’d held her too long, she wouldn’t have been able to pass, which meant she would have had to delay going to the library. I honestly don’t know what she would have done, but knowing her, she’d probably Crush the prince or something.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She asked if she could show it to him after class instead since his practice was about to start back, too. He said something really weird to her, though. It was something like, “You’ll need more than a strange highbeast to bait me. How does your Ewigeliebe feel about his Geduldh trying to entice other men?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>She told him, “My deepest apologies, but it seems Chaocipher is playing at being Bluanfah. I assure you, Geduldh will only accept Ewigeliebe’s touch.”</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand covered his face as he flushed with fury and embarrassment. That damned prince dared to try to tempt his Geduldh even knowing she was engaged to him! The fool mocked the courtship necklace while simultaneously proving the need for it.</p><p>He made himself stop and take several calming breaths. He needed to think about this objectively. It was far more likely the prince was merely needling her using the easiest target available after she insulted him at the fellowship gathering. He was far too obsessed with Eglantine to even consider courting Rozemyne.</p><p>Ferdinand read through the exchange again and felt his fury flare back to life. Just how foolish could Rozemyne be?! Did she realize what she was insinuating? Perhaps he needed to speak with Elvira. She was still too early in her summer for this sort of education, but it would be far preferable to having a ten-year-old say such things about her grown fiance. She had been an adult woman in her past life, so surely she knew the nature of Beischmacht’s domain. She simply needed to learn the language associated with it to prevent any future blunders like this.</p><p>Also, why did he keep getting compared to Ewigeliebe?!</p><p>Putting that aside, he read the end of Wilfried’s letter.</p><p>
<em>He dismissed her after that, and she joined the rest of us for our practice. We both passed, so I waited with her in the hall because I didn’t want to leave her alone. When Prince Anastasius came out, he said he didn’t want to see the highbeast anymore because he had more important things to do. Rozemyne told him she understood that royalty was really busy.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Could you explain what’s happening here? Neither one of us understands what his goal is. I don’t think she knelt wrong or anything when we greeted him at the fellowship gathering, but he started off by insulting her. I’m not sure why he keeps antagonizing her. Is he just bored, maybe?</em>
</p><p>
<em>–Wilfried</em>
</p><p>Well, that settled matters in his mind. Ferdinand took up his pen and wrote his response.</p><p>
<em>Wilfried,</em>
</p><p>
<em>No, you did not cause any problems with Ahrensbach when you rejected Lady Detlinde’s untoward behavior. Anyone would see she was clearly in the wrong. Avoid her as much as possible and continue rejecting her invitations as you have been.</em>
</p><p>
<em>As for the prince, I cannot say with full certainty, but it appears he is harassing Rozemyne after their conversation at the fellowship gathering. His antagonistic behavior at the beginning was likely due to being intimidated by her reputation as a saint.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Regardless, both of you should avoid him as much as possible. Getting involved with royalty only leads to trouble.</em>
</p><p>
<em>–Ferdinand</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Unfortunately, Rozemyne was unable to heed his warnings through no fault of her own, though it still made him want to pinch her cheeks.</p><p>
<em>To my fiance,</em>
</p><p>
<em>Today, I attended a tea party with the music professors. Lady Eglantine was there, so Prince Anastasius showed up uninvited, causing trouble for everyone. Is royalty not taught social etiquette or something?</em>
</p><p>
<em>The professors had a lot to say about you.</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand groaned and covered his eyes. Those meddlesome women had likely just spurred Rozemyne into gathering information about his academy days. Had his engagement to her coaxed the professors into divulging information best left unsaid?</p><p>
<em>They said you had the most beautiful singing voice when you were a child. I wish I could have heard it. They also said that everyone was so upset when you hit puberty and your voice changed. I think you should play something for them so they can see how wonderfully you sing now. Just don’t do that song about Geduldh. In fact, never sing that song in front of other women again.</em>
</p><p>He couldn’t understand her reasoning. It was a popular song throughout the duchy and one he particularly enjoyed playing. He tapped his temple as he tried to recall anything she might have said or done that would indicate she disliked the song, but then he remembered what she had said the first time she heard him play.</p><p>
<em>“I think no girl would reject you if you sang a song of love to them.”</em>
</p><p><em>Oh, so that’s it, is it?</em> he thought as he smiled to himself.</p><p>Immediately, he dismissed the idea. He knew how she was about her family, remembering how she had toiled to make up for the two years of education she missed so she wouldn’t have to go to the Royal Academy at the same time as Charlotte since it would threaten her position as her older sister. She was likely attempting to protect her position as his fiance in a similar manner.</p><p>Her letter continued.</p><p>
<em>They complimented Rosina a lot! My musician really is amazing! I’m glad she got so much praise. It really made her day! Kind of like how I feel when you praise me.</em>
</p><p>He chuckled, picturing her hopping about like a shumil chirping, “Praise me! Praise me!” What a handful.</p><p>
<em>Anyway, Lady Eglantine was lovely. I can see why everyone compares her to the Goddess of Light. There was such a warm, happy atmosphere as we listened to Rosina play and talked about music, but then Prince Anastasius went and ruined it all.</em>
</p><p>
<em>It started when he called my pound cake a “poverty dish,” but when Lady Eglantine said she liked it, he started eating it. Turns out he really liked the rumtopf, even though he’s from the Sovereignty. Their desserts are so full of sugar it makes my mouth gritty. It was good at least to find out even those used to overly-sweet desserts still like our much milder recipes.</em>
</p><p>She went on about which type of pound cake everyone liked, how well she expected each type to sell, and what plans she needed to make for production. Why was business the only thing she was ever this detailed on?</p><p>
<em>Anyway, when Lady Eglantine complimented my hair saying it was blessed by the God of Darkness himself, I returned it saying hers was blessed by the Goddess of Light. I told her more about rinsham and said it would be sold as a specialty product soon, but that made her sad because it wasn’t for sale yet.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Before I could even tell her that the sample I had promised her would be enough for three to four uses, Prince Anastasius butted in and demanded I sell it to him on the spot! Did he not even think of the business problems that would cause us down the line?</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand could guarantee he had not. No one would have. Only she would have considered such a thing.</p><p>Well, he would now, too, after becoming more involved with her industries during her time in the jureve than he had in the previous weave. He realized her abnormality was starting to influence him, and he found it disturbing.</p><p>
<em>I was able to dodge it by saying only Aub Ehrenfest could grant permission to conduct business deals, which a prince should have known, right? Even Lady Eglantine chastised him, saying these sorts of things could only happen at the Archduke Conference.</em>
</p><p>
<em>He kept pushing, though, saying she surely wanted it before the graduation ceremony. I was able to calm him down at that point by saying I had already promised her a sample and would be sharing it with her during our tea party.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Anyway, you won’t believe what he did next. He demanded I write a song for Lady Eglantine’s graduation dedicated to the Goddess of Light. He even said that as the Saint of Ehrenfest, I should have no problem making a song.</em>
</p><p>
<em>You know, it’s pretty terrifying watching someone go on a rampage when no one’s holding their leash.</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand snorted. At least she was developing some self awareness from this migraine-inducing incident.</p><p>
<em>Anyway, I hummed a melody for Rosina to record, and when Lady Eglantine said she liked it, I said it was inspired by her performance as the Goddess of Light in whirling class.</em>
</p><p>Sighing heavily, he set the paper down for a moment and rubbed his temples. While he understood Rozemyne was merely trying to compliment the girl’s dancing, she had somehow failed to notice she had praised Geduldh before Ewigeliebe. How was her social awareness still so lacking after all that effort Elvira and Florencia put into teaching her?</p><p>
<em>Sadly, it did not meet Prince Anastasius’ expectations. I suppose I shall have to try again since he gave me an order. Would you be able to help me write a better song? He surely can’t be disappointed with anything you help compose!</em>
</p><p>
<em>Oh, and they told me about how Sylvester went crazy over Florencia. I think I’ll use it against him the next time he starts teasing me.</em>
</p><p>
<em>– Rozemyne</em>
</p><p>Holding his head in his hands, he let out an exasperated sigh. Just why had he worked himself half to death in the temple to let her spend time training with Elvira?</p><p>Something had surely gone terribly wrong at the end. She spent too much time highlighting the prince’s faults and then glossed over whatever had occurred when he rejected her song before attempting to distract him with new music.</p><p>Just for that, he wasn’t going to tell her how miserably doomed her plan to defend against Sylvester was.</p>

<p>The day for measuring the library magic tools was set, and Ferdinand once again reminded Hirschur he was not going to leave the dormitory, so he would not be able to go to her lab. That settled, he went to his workshop at his estate and gathered the materials to make an amulet of Verbergen. There was no reason to miss an opportunity to watch Rozemyne’s first ditter game, after all.</p><p>“Gruttrishiet.” He summoned his Book of Mestionora since it would save a significant amount of time to copy and paste the magic circle he needed rather than draw it out himself.</p><p>He thought of what he needed, but the pages did not turn.</p><p>His heart leapt into his throat as he flipped through them himself, and his stomach dropped.</p><p>He was missing roughly 60% of the book. The only contents were those he was originally given when he first received his Wisdom.</p><p>“Wait,” he told himself, getting his breathing back under control. “This isn’t a problem.” He could solve this. He just needed to plot out how to open the way to Erwaermen and receive the rest of his Wisdom. Going during the school term wasn’t feasible, nor would the interduchy tournament provide much opportunity. Maybe he could plan to go to Hirschur’s lab and once it got late enough take a break to go to the statue in the library. Would that run the risk of letting someone in the Sovereign Knights’ Order see him, though? Should he just break in from above again?</p><p>No, wait, he didn’t need to get it yet. He could remember the circle for the amulet. There was no reason to panic. He wouldn’t need Rozemyne to copy her book into his. He had plenty of time to go complete his Wisdom before she would even have access to the underground library.</p><p>After drawing out the circle, he got to work brewing. The familiar flow of preparing ingredients, adding them to the brew, and channeling his mana as he stirred calmed his mind. When at last he held the amulet, only his frustration with the petty goddess remained.</p><p> </p><p>When the time came to leave, Sylvester and Karstedt followed him into the transfer room.</p><p>“Hey, don’t do anything to cause trouble, okay?”</p><p>Ferdinand snorted. “I believe you have me confused with Rozemyne.”</p><p>“No, you’re both a source of stomach aches for me,” Sylvester said. Then, he narrowed his eyes and began looking him over.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>“Making sure you don’t have any more ice to cover my adoptive daughter with.”</p><p>Again with this? “While your concern is admirable, it is misplaced.”</p><p>“Oh, really? You’ve practically got her encased already. Can you blame me for showing a little concern? It can’t be easy for her to have that much foreign mana on her.”</p><p>“You exaggerate. It was just a courtship necklace.”</p><p>“And a hairstick,” Karstedt said.</p><p>“And about five hundred protection charms,” Sylvester added.</p><p>Ferdinand rubbed his temple and took a steadying breath. “Aside from a <em>very small number</em> of protection amulets, none of what you mentioned is touching her skin, so she should not feel my mana from them. Need I remind you that the rest of your family, including yourself, are also wearing charms I made?”</p><p>“So there ARE some that are touching her skin!” Sylvester yelled. “They better not be anywhere inappropriate! You know what? It doesn’t matter where they are. It’s still inappropriate!</p><p>“Look, you’re my little brother. You know I care about you. But good gods, man, I think you have a problem.”</p><p>He couldn’t be serious. A glance at Karstedt’s dark glare, however, showed at least one of them was. “Sylvester, I find it exceedingly disturbing that I have to explain this to a graduate of the Royal Academy, but protection charms tend to be single-use and must be manually refilled before they can be used again.”</p><p>“Uh, yeah, I know.”</p><p>“Then you also know that if Rozemyne had had such charms on her when she was attacked, the criminal would only need to weather one or two counterspells before completing his task. The charms I made Rozemyne will instantly refill on their own after use, so she will always be protected. That is why they must be in contact with her skin.”</p><p>“Won’t that risk draining her of too much mana?” Sylvester asked.</p><p>Ferdinand narrowed his eyes at him. “Do you have any idea how utterly foolish you sound right now?”</p><p>He held his hands up in defeat. “Fine, fine, but you gotta see it from my side, too. I mean, you have to admit that necklace was a bit over the top. Even the prince was teasing her over it. I get you’re just trying to protect her, but think about how it looks to everyone else. What you see as a solid defense, everyone else sees as a grown man marking a first year student as his territory. It’s a classic Ewigeliebe move.”</p><p>Ferdinand winced at the accusation. It wasn’t…completely incorrect.</p><p>Karstedt placed a hand on his shoulder. “We understand you’re feeling overprotective after what happened to her, but you still have to be sensible. She’s surrounded by guard knights who have been training under my father and using her mana compression method for two years now. She’s also already got a schtappe, and next year, she’ll know how to make a shield a lot faster than she does now.”</p><p>“Don’t forget she was training with Bonifatius, too, after she woke up,” Sylvester added.</p><p><em>Yes, I’m sure her intensive training in walking and lifting her arms will serve her well in combat.</em> This conversation was becoming tedious. “Fine, I understand. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to go meet Hirschur.”</p><p>When he arrived at the dormitory, Rozemyne was there to greet him, her face aglow with excitement, along with Wilfried.</p><p>“Welcome, Uncle!”</p><p>“We’re glad to see you, Ferdinand!”</p><p>“Hello, Wilfried. …Hello, Rozemyne,” he said, giving her a cold smile.</p><p>She instantly straightened her back as Wilfried looked at her with a knowing smirk. “Um… I-I passed all my classes so far, even court etiquette! Wilfried was the only other one who passed in one try. Oh, and–”</p><p>Ferdinand pinched both her cheeks, enjoying what remained of their squishy texture. “And you insulted a prince within moments of meeting him! I warned you to be careful around royalty, and what do you do? You mock them for not having Grutrissheit!”</p><p>“I sowwee!! Le gooo!”</p><p>He pulled on her cheeks until he was satisfied and then released her. “Are you even capable of thinking before you speak?”</p><p>Rubbing at her sore face, she glared up at him and said, “What was I supposed to do? I was doing my best even though he kept attacking me, but then he insulted you! Was I supposed to let him talk about my fiancé that way?”</p><p>He froze, his heart skipping a beat. Her words felt like echoes of the ones she'd spoken to him in his hidden room the day she'd claimed him as family and declared she would take over all of Yurgenschmidt to save him. However, those were the words of a child speaking of a parent or sibling. These felt...possessive. Was she starting to see him as something other than her Erwachlehren?</p><p>Eventually he cleared his throat and said, “Yes, you should have let him say whatever he wished about me. Do you realize what a member of royalty could do to you? Did you think I gave you those warnings to hear myself talk?”</p><p>“So you would let him talk like that about me?”</p><p>That brought him up short. The thought doused him in cold anger. “No,” he said through a tight grin, “but I would have handled it like an archduke candidate from the 13th-ranked duchy should. I will have to ask Elvira to intensify your training when you return. Good grief, you give me no end of headaches.” He healed the damage to her cheeks and then held out his hand to escort her.</p><p>Though she was still pouting, she let him lead her into the common room, Wilfried following behind. As he entered, the students all greeted him, though the Former Veronica Faction children eyed him with caution. Hirschur walked up to him and said, “You’re late. Your fiancé refused to leave until you arrived, wasting precious time I could have been dedicating to my research. However, you’re here now, so off you go, Rozemyne.”</p><p>Wilfried assigned half of his guards to go with her, including that fool Traugott. At least he shouldn’t cause Rozemyne any trouble since he wasn’t her guard knight in this weave.</p><p>Once they left, Hirschur turned to him and said, “Now then, do tell me about the hairpin. Those are quite the feystones. Knowing you, they have several magic circles engraved in them. ”</p><p>Ferdinand simply smiled in response.</p><p>“Come now, if you won’t tell me, at least let me inspect it.”</p><p>“Not a chance.” Especially since they used some of the protections from the shumils they were about to inspect.</p><p>She stared at him, tapping her finger against her temple. “I see. I’m glad you’re doing well. Tell me what you’ve been working on since you graduated.”</p><p>“You expect me to summarize eight years of research in the time it will take them to fetch the magic tools from the library?”</p><p>“You wouldn’t have to if you would have kept in contact.”</p><p>Ferdinand grimaced at that. “Very well.” He told her about a couple of the tools he had developed during his earlier days at the temple, and her stream of questions about them filled the time until Rozemyne returned. She announced which retainers were allowed to touch them and included him in the list, much to Hirschur’s annoyance.</p><p>Once the tools were stripped and measured, he got to work furiously copying the circles onto Rozemyne’s plant paper, having to lean over Philine to do so until she finally gave up and left the work to an older student. Since she hadn’t even started the scholar course yet, it wasn’t surprising she was having trouble with the advanced magic circles.</p><p>“Oh ho? There are gaps in these,” Hirschur said, amusement in her voice.</p><p>“Yes,” Ferdinand said. “We should be able to figure out what they are, though.”</p><p>She nodded. “Yes, I imagine you could. Alright, I’ll leave you to these while I go look at the clothes.”</p><p>Once he finished with the tools’ stomachs, he had them bend over to start copying the circles on their bottoms. Through the bustling students’ excited chatter, a quiet giggle caught his attention. He turned to find Rozemyne standing a few feet away, a warm, playful smile on her lips.</p><p>“I’m glad to see you’re having fun,” she said.</p><p>He merely scoffed at her and got back to work.</p><p> </p><p>“Then I’ll head back to the castle,” Ferdinand said as they were wrapping up.</p><p>Hirschur raised a brow at him. “And what of your promise to help with my research? Surely you didn’t assume copying down circles was the extent of it? I could have had any decent scholar apprentice do as much.”</p><p>He waved her off, saying, “I’ll return on Earthday. That shouldn’t cause you to miss any classes”</p><p>She nodded. “Very well. I’ll be waiting, but as you said, I must go to class now.” With that, she spun on her heel and left.</p><p>As the girls with permission to touch the tools started dressing them again and the knight apprentices began forming a loose group near the door, Rozemyne approached him and said, “I’ll see you off, Ferdinand.”</p><p>“No, as Schwartz and Weiss’ master, it’s your duty to stay with the tools. I am perfectly capable of seeing myself home.”</p><p>She pouted, but the look of defiant defeat in her eyes signaled his victory. “I’ll be back on Earthday, though I imagine I’ll be spending the majority of that time in Hirschur’s lab.” He paused for several moments then leaned down a bit and said, “If you were to continue your pestering ways even here at the academy, I could suffer the time lost on research to eat lunch and dinner should you force it on me. I’m sure Hirschur feels similarly.”</p><p>“Why do you have to be so round about?” she sighed. “Just say you want to eat with me!”</p><p>“I said nothing of your coming along.”</p><p>“Of course I’d be coming along!” she huffed. “Why would I have my chefs prepare a meal, take it all the way down to her lab, and not share it with you?”</p><p>He smirked slightly and said, “Your retainers are waiting for you. Take care, Rozemyne.” Once they parted, he went into the transportation room alone and then activated the amulet of Verbergen before walking back out into the common room.</p><p>Just as he entered, Angelica burst through the main door, saying students from multiple duchies were planning to ambush them. Wilfried immediately jumped into action, ordering all guard knights save some new apprentices to accompany Rozemyne. After beckoning her, Alexis, and Cornelius over, he worked with them to set up a basic defense, including formation, counter measures, and escape plan.</p><p>“Alright, Rozemyne, you have the defense amulets Uncle gave you?”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>“Good. You’ll have to hold onto the shumils, so you won’t be able to do anything, but it sounds like they have some impressive defense measures. You always fill their heads, right? Why don’t you put some mana in the feystones on their clothes just in case.”</p><p>“Right!” She scampered off to do as he said then called all the knights to her. “I’m going to offer you Angriff’s blessing.”</p><p>As the apprentice knights glanced at each other with confusion, Angelica and Cornelius knelt in front of her. The rest slowly picked up on the hint and also dropped to one knee, forming a circle around her before she showered them with the blessing.</p><p>“Okay, let’s go,” Cornelius said, opening the door. Ferdinand slipped out with them, keeping an eye on the Former Veronica Faction knights. They all seemed more concerned with the threat of ambush than betraying Rozemyne, but one could never be too careful.</p><p>When they turned the corner to the hall leading to the library, they were met with a glut of students from different duchies led by that pest Lestilaut. Oddly enough, Clarissa was among them, despite being a scholar.</p><p>As Lestilaut began shouting, Rozemyne drew herself up and responded to him in a calm, measured voice, explaining in clear, precise language that she’d come into possession of the tools through a blessing of Mestionora, that new masters needed to provide them with new clothes, and that Solange had given her permission to take them to the Ehrenfest dorm to be measured. That caused many of the students to lose interest and leave, though Lestilaut continued to insist she give ownership over to him.</p><p>“I understand your position,” she said. “Please tell me how often you go to the library.”</p><p>“Ha! Archduke candidates have no need to go to the library! We have scholars go for us!”</p><p>What a buffoon. No wonder no one knew how to find Grutrissheit. Then again, with no archnoble librarians, it wasn’t as though archduke candidates could enter the restricted underground library.</p><p>Rozemyne wore a regretful expression as she said, “My deepest apologies, but as Schwartz and Weiss are <em>library</em> magic tools, their owner must go to the library at least once every three days to supply them with mana, or they will stop functioning. Are you volunteering to start going to the library regularly? I would happily welcome you there. There are so many fascinating books to read, and–”</p><p>“Did you not hear me?” he shouted. “I don’t go to the library!”</p><p>“Then I’m afraid you cannot be their master, unless your goal is to ensure they stop working. I can’t imagine why else you would insist on taking possession of them while simultaneously refusing to offer them the mana they need to function.”</p><p>“Enough of this! We’ll take them by force if we have to!”</p><p>The Dunkelfelger knights charged forward, and Angelica leapt into the air, landing in the middle of them and taking them down in droves. Cornelius and several others maintained a defensive line while a dozen or so formed a circle around Rozemyne.</p><p>Ferdinand had to forcibly press himself against the wall to keep himself from going to her side. He kept reminding himself that she’d come out of this unscathed in the first weave, and she was stronger this time.</p><p>When a gap opened in the fighting, Rozemyne enhanced her legs and bolted down the hall, dragging the shumils behind her. Half a dozen Dunkelfelger knights noticed and launched attacks at her.</p><p>It took every ounce of control for Ferdinand to remain silent and immobile. The explosive counterspell sent the foolish knights flying, and Rozemyne kept running.</p><p>“STOP!” Everyone froze as the prince of fools alighted from his highbeast into the hall. At Rozemyne’s immediate request, he allowed her to return the tools to the library. He then listened to both her and Lestilaut’s testimonies and had them call their dorm supervisors. To Ferdinand’s chagrin, Rozemyne had to threaten Hirschur to get her to answer the prince’s summons. How had she survived so long in the Sovereignty? Then again, if this was the level of disrespect Prince Anastasius was willing to tolerate, it would explain why he didn’t punish Rozemyne for her rude behavior.</p><p>Naturally, as with any conflict involving Dunkelfelger, they decided to settle the matter over ditter. It was fascinating watching the strategies Rozemyne described in the last weave play out before him. Sadly, her words did not do the incoordination of the apprentice knights justice, and as he was planning what sort of training he’d ask Karstedt and Bonifatius to put them through, he froze as cold rage burned him from the inside.</p><p>He had heard that Traugott had disobeyed orders and resigned his post after being offered Rozemyne’s compression method.</p><p>What he had not heard was how he’d yelled at Rozemyne in front of everyone, showing such blatant disrespect that Bonifatius, his own grandfather, would have crushed his skull with his bare hands had he been present. How dare some weakling son of a second wife speak to his fiancé, an archduke candidate, as though she were beneath him? She’d seen more battles by the time she was eight than he’d seen in his entire life, and he had the gall to accuse her of knowing nothing of that pitiful spat he called a fight?</p><p>Ferdinand had to take several deep breaths and reach for an empty feystone before he did something he would regret. There was no need to give into momentary anger. He was a patient man, and there were any number of accidents that could happen in a Lord of Winter hunt after the boy came of age.</p><p>He watched the rest of the ditter game in a mix of awe and anger. Even knowing the story, Rozemyne’s demonstration of tactical prowess impressed him. Her victory incensed Lestilaut, causing him to call into question her saintly reputation. Rauffen, in contrast, praised her as being worthy of marrying “the Lord of Evil'' while Clarissa fell victim to the same fanaticism that had made Hartmut so malleable. While Rozemyne had been right that it would have been better for Ehrenfest to lose, at least they could count on Dunkelfelger to ground them into dust while she was home for the Dedication Ritual.</p><p>Ferdinand returned with them and used the general excitement around their arrival to slip down the hall and teleport back to Ehrenfest. He sincerely prayed they’d manage to avoid any more disasters before Rozemyne and Wilfried returned for the Dedication Ritual.</p>

<p>I paced the length of the common room, nervously clenching and unclenching my fists as I waited for the Ehrenfest students to return from taking Schwartz and Weiss back to the library. It was taking far, far too long. Just what was going on that was causing such a delay?</p><p>After an eternity, one of the apprentice knights came to report, explaining that Dunklefelger and several other duchies’ students had intercepted Rozemyne on her way to the library, demanding she hand over the magical tools and even went so far as to attack them. While Angelica and Traugott were clearing a path, Rozemyne had bolted for safety, carrying the shumils with her, when several magical attacks came her way. The protective magic circles on the shumils activated and blew the attackers away, and it was at this time the prince had shown up to mediate. They ultimately decided to settle the matter with treasure-stealing ditter.</p><p>As I only had a couple of knight apprentices with me, I couldn’t leave the dormitory, so I was stuck waiting, unable to assist my sister, who had only been able to remove her magical enhancement tools a season ago. Just where did the second rank duchy with the country’s strongest military get off challenging a girl who’d only just come out of convalescence?</p><p>To vent my frustration, I started going through some basic workout routines before working on compressing my mana. While my method was sorely lacking compared to Rozemyne’s, it was better than nothing.</p><p>Eventually, everyone returned, and I nearly wept with relief to see my sister unharmed, though the perturbed look on her face made it all too clear what the results of the ditter were.</p><p>“Hey, Rozemyne,” I said, trying to cheer her up, “don’t beat yourself up over it. Dunklefelger is the second ranked duchy. Pretty much anyone would lose to them.”</p><p>“Oh, we didn’t lose,” she said, “though it would have been better for our knights if we had.”</p><p>I blinked in confusion. “What do you mean?”</p><p>She waved a hand, and Leonore detailed for me what had transpired, causing me to wince with embarrassment. Bonifatius was going to murder all of us when he found out just how poorly our knights had performed.</p><p>“...And then Traugott yelled at Rozemyne that–”</p><p>“Traugott did <em>what?</em>” I asked, feeling my mana swell before I pushed it into the protective charms Uncle had given me.</p><p>As Leonore started to give a summary of my guard knight’s actions, I cut her off. “No, tell me exactly what he said and did.”</p><p>When she stated that he’d yelled, “What would you know, Lady Rozemyne?! You didn’t even join the battle!” I raised a hand to stop her.</p><p>“Enough.” As I turned my glare on Traugott, he gasped and went pale. “I sent you to protect my sister, and this is how you act? You defied and disrespected an archduke candidate by refusing to follow orders and then <em>yelled</em> at her in front of not only our knights and dorm supervisor but in front of Dunklefelger as well? Just where do you get off ignoring her orders?”</p><p>He choked out, “My lord, she’s not my liege, and–”</p><p>That made my rage spike even higher. “Traugott, who was the highest ranking person from Ehrenfest on that ditter field?”</p><p>“...Lady Rozemyne, my lord.”</p><p>“Wilfried,” Rozemyne said, stepping in front of me. “Calm yourself. Your mana…”</p><p>That’s when I realized I had been lightly Crushing my fool of a knight apprentice. “Right, sorry,” I said, taking a deep breath and closing my eyes as I poured the raging mana into the charms.</p><p>Once I was sure I had myself under control, I turned back to the idiot who’d disrespected my sister and said, “It is unacceptable for a knight serving the archduke family to act this way. You’re dismissed.”</p><p>“Wait, Wilfried!”</p><p>“No, Rozemyne,” I said, holding up a hand to stop her objection. “If a knight defied Aub Ehrenfest or Uncle Ferdinand, it wouldn’t end with their dismissal. I know you want to show mercy to everyone, but in this case, it would do more harm than good.”</p><p>“But…” She looked between Traugott, who was staring red-faced at the floor, and Rihyarda.</p><p>Her head attendant stepped forward wearing a deep frown. “He’s correct, my lady.”</p><p>“But your family…”</p><p>“It is my great shame that my family has caused you so much trouble,” Rihyarda said, kneeling and crossing her arms. “Please concern yourself with Traugott no further.”</p><p>When Rozemyne still looked unconvinced, I had my head attendant prepare a meeting room and escorted her inside. “Rozemyne,” I said, “I get how you feel, but really, there’s no reason to waste any time thinking about him.”</p><p>She shook her head. “I’m not thinking about him at all. I just don’t want Rihyarda’s family to suffer because of that fool’s actions.”</p><p>I barely held back a snort of laughter. Uncle really was rubbing off on her. “Well, Rozemyne, think about it this way - are you going to dismiss Rihyarda?”</p><p>“Of course not!”</p><p>“Right, you’re not. Uncle Bonifatius isn’t really going to be harmed by this, and I doubt Gudrun or Justus are going to lose their positions over it, either. It’ll be a stain, sure, but I’ve got a pretty big stain on my reputation, too, and you helped me through that, right?”</p><p>She nodded but then said, “What if he decides to get revenge on you for firing him or me for causing it?”</p><p>“What do you mean?” I asked. “Everyone in the dormitory is going to ostracize him, so he won’t even be able to get close to me or you.”</p><p>“He could tell another duchy about our picture books or karuta.”</p><p>I snorted. “He’d better be living with them first. Pretty sure Father would murder him if Uncle didn’t get to him first.”</p><p>“That’s true,” she said, “but the damage would already be done by that point…”</p><p>“Rozemyne,” I said, dipping my head a little to get eye-to-eye with her, “don’t act like those are the only ideas you have to improve Ehrenfest’s grades. No matter what he tells anyone else, they don’t have the printing industry, and they don’t have your ability to bring even warring factions together. To be honest, I’m more afraid for the other duchies if they try to stand against the Saint of Ehrenfest.”</p><p>She puffed out her cheeks in a pout, but her eyes weren’t sad anymore, so I was happy to weather her annoyance.</p>

<p>After Ferdinand’s return to Ehrenfest, he was summoned to the aub’s office. Sylvester and Karstedt were waiting for him with vize, room cleared.</p><p>“So?” Sylvester asked.</p><p>“Hirschur’s research is proving to be fascinating,” Ferdinand said with a small smile, amused at the annoyance in his brother’s face. “The magic circles on the library magic tools and their clothes are advanced beyond anything either of us has studied before. We could determine immediately that there were strong life and darkness components, which might have explained why Rozemyne was able to control them since she has both elements. However, there were several gaps that–”</p><p>“That’s not what I’m asking about!” Sylvester cut him off.</p><p>“Oh? Then you must want to know about the wide-scale impact this will have on Ehrenfest.” He went on to detail the need to provide new garments for the shumils including all that entailed, Hirschur’s plan to present on what she discovered, and the interest this would undoubtedly draw to Ehrenfest during the interduchy tournament and Archduke Conference.</p><p>Scratching his head, Sylvester muttered, “No end of headaches… We’ll need to get Florencia and Elvira involved with the clothes. Okay, anything else with the shumils?”</p><p>“I’ll be going to the academy on Earthdays to assist Hirschur with researching them.”</p><p>“I’m sorry. What?”</p><p>“Did you not hear me?”</p><p>Sylvester threw his hands in the air and pulled at his hair as Karstedt held his head in his hands. “Can’t you leave her alone while she’s at the Royal Academy at least?!”</p><p>Ferdinand furrowed his brows, pretending not to understand. “Of course I have to meet her at the academy. Hirschur rarely returns to Ehrenfest.”</p><p>“He means Rozemyne,” Karstedt sighed.</p><p>He gave a shrug. “Forgive me, as we were not discussing her, I did not make the connection.”</p><p>Sylvester leapt to his feet and slammed his palms on the desk. “Do you seriously expect me to believe you’re not finagaling your way into the academy to see her?”</p><p>“How tedious…” Not everything he did revolved around Rozemyne. Did they honestly think him so desperate that he couldn’t at least wait until the Dedication Ritual to see her? Just how many weeks did she spend at the Linkberg’s when he was trapped at the temple doing the work of High Priest and High Bishop without her or Damuel’s help? “Do I need to provide you with the communications where I explicitly told Hirschur I would look at her research during the interduchy tournament and would not come to the Royal Academy during the academic term?”</p><p>“So how’d you end up going anyway?”</p><p>Ferdinand tapped his temple as he thought of how to explain. “Some of the information the students gathered mentioned Professor Fraularm’s connection to Count Bindewald. In exchange for my assistance with a future research project, she agreed to monitor the situation and step in when necessary.”</p><p>Plopping back into his chair with a groan, Sylvester said, “See, this is the stuff you need to tell us about, Ferdinand. Do you think you’re the only one that cares about Rozemyne’s safety? Hell, if I had known about this, I might have been able to take measures without you having to make an open-ended promise like that.”</p><p>With a sigh and shake of his head, he continued, “I don’t know how to explain this any clearer than I already have, but let me try one more time to get this through to you. The problem is not that you want to protect her. The problem is how you’re going about it.”</p><p>“I fail to see the issue with the measures I’ve taken.”</p><p>“That’s it! I give up! Karstedt, you try.”</p><p>The man sighed and lifted his head. “Try to imagine if Sylvester were engaged to Rozemyne and he did what you’ve done.”</p><p>Ferdinand would murder him.</p><p>“Ah, I see that look!” Sylvester said, pointing a finger at him. “You get it! You finally get it!”</p><p><em>They</em> were the ones who didn’t get it. They hadn’t nearly killed her by locking her in the repentance chamber, watched her fall from a fatal height while they were trapped behind a finicky goddess’ barrier, narrowly caught her before Bonifatius pulverized her against a tree, felt the guilt of knowing she would have died if she hadn’t forced them to help her make her jureve when she did, watched helplessly for three years as she slept, witnessed her intense fear of feystones, found her being torn apart from the inside by selfish gods with no hint of intelligence, or held her as she died and melted away in their arms.</p><p>They knew nothing. They didn’t understand just how fragile her thread was, how many times it nearly snapped, how many of those times were <em>his</em> fault. Because of his promise to his father, he’d even considered killing her by his own hand on more than one occasion. They might have been worried about her, but they couldn’t protect her from the dangers she faced. In fact, they were actively preventing him from doing it himself. Sylvester’s thoughtless ban on “ice” meant he couldn’t give her the mana-chain glove that would keep Mestionora from descending on her, nor could he offer her any charms to prevent the other gods from doing the same. Anwachs was already watching over her growth. Dregarnuhr had unraveled the weave for her. Mestinora was using her to save Erwaermen. He didn’t know what other gods had their eyes on her already, but he absolutely did not trust them to learn from their mistakes.</p><p>They were all fools.</p><p>Ferdinand sighed and hid his emotions behind the door he’d used when dealing with Veronica. “I will be going to conduct research. Even if I had ulterior motives, do you believe Hirschur or I would step away long enough to do anything else?”</p><p>“Well, you have a point,” Sylvester said. “We should probably be more concerned about how hard you’ll crash when you come back.”</p><p>“Don’t waste your time on such foolishness, or do you not have enough work to occupy you? Perhaps you could return years of favors by taking on some of–”</p><p>“NO! No! I have plenty of work! Pleeeenty! So, uh, how’s Wilfried doing?”</p><p> </p><p>That night, Ferdinand received a letter from Rozemyne.</p><p>
<em>To my fiance,</em>
</p><p>
<em>It was nice seeing you today. I’m glad you get to have more chances to do what you love.</em>
</p><p>
<em>After you left, we went to take the shumils back to the library, and Dunkelfelger met us in the hallway. They wanted to take ownership of the magic tools, but since they didn’t have anyone willing to go to the library to fill them with mana, the prince had us play ditter for them. We won!</em>
</p><p>
<em>I heard from Professor Rauffen that you’re known as the Lord of Evil and that you were a nightmare on the ditter field. He said my tactics reminded him of you and that I was worthy to be your fiance. Of course, this was all for the library! It would be too sad if Professor Solange had to manage the whole library by herself again just because someone from a higher-ranked duchy refused to go refill Schwartz and Weiss, right?</em>
</p><p>
<em>The prince summoned me and Professor Solange to his villa this afternoon, and he asked about how I came to be the master of the shumils. He didn’t seem to really get it when she told him it was through a blessing of Mestionora, though.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Oh, and he asked me to spy on Lady Eglantine for him. That’s really weird, right? Why doesn’t he just talk to her if he wants to escort her that badly? Seems a lot better than sending a kid to ask for him, but since you’re the only boy who’s ever courted me, I guess I don’t have enough experience to say either way.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I look forward to seeing you on Earthday!</em>
</p><p>
<em>– Rozemyne</em>
</p><p>Considering there was no mention of how the “meeting” in the hallway devolved into a brawl, how she likely made an enemy of Lestilaut, or how Traugott disrespected her, it made him highly suspicious of what she was leaving out of the conversation with the prince, especially since she tried to distract him with those last two lines. It sounded like what had happened in the previous weave, however, so he wasn’t overly concerned.</p><p>Even so, if the prince weren’t expecting her to report back as soon as she finished with Eglantine, he’d summon her back immediately. There was no predicting what new headaches she’d find to cause him.</p><p> </p><p>Ferdinand lost Justus for a couple of days when Traugott was summoned for a family discussion, which meant he had no attendant when he returned to the Ehrenfest dorm on Earthday. Before Justus had left, though, he’d let him know that Wilfried had publicly fired Traugott, bringing him all the shame Rozemyne’s “merciful” acceptance of his resignation had not, so Ferdinand was in a much better mood.</p><p>Rozemyne and Wilfried were both there to greet him, and he saw from the corner of his eye one of the boy’s attendants sending off an ordonnanz, likely to announce his arrival to Hirschur. He wouldn’t be able to delay his departure, then.</p><p>As he marched through the common room, he got confirmation that, aside from the royal summons that was already reported, everyone had managed to stay out of trouble in the three days since he’d last seen them. “You haven’t been swarmed with ditter requests?” he asked Rozemyne.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” she said, “I asked Hirschur to decline them for us.”</p><p>“How did you convince her?”</p><p>“I promised her she could look at some of your research papers you sent with me.”</p><p>“Hm. Well done.”</p><p>The way her face lit up in the middle of the occupied dormitory vexed him. She obviously read his mood as she put on her noble smile and covered her cheeks, taking several steps back.</p><p>After making his farewells, he stepped into the hall and activated his amulet of Verbergen, wary of accidentally meeting someone from the Sovereign Knights Order. He arrived at Hirschur’s lab without incident and went inside after a perfunctory knock.</p><p>“Ah, Ferdinand, you’re late,” Hirschur said, her hair and clothes a mess, the table before her strewn with papers. The sight gave him a warm sense of nostalgia. “Now, come look at this part. I believe it’s what was responsible for the tools reflecting multiple attacks at once.”</p><p>Though he was familiar with these circles already, going over them with Hirschur brought back some of the very few good memories of his childhood, and he was drawn in like always until a knock came at the door what seemed to be only minutes after they started.</p><p>Rozemyne’s attendants entered and froze as they took in the state of the lab. “Oh my,” Brunhilde said, “we can’t have our lady eat in here.”</p><p>“It’s fine,” Rozemyne said. “You can simply clean a spot for us to eat. I don’t want to disturb their research.”</p><p>“You’re already disturbing my research,” Hirschur said.</p><p>“I brought lunch.”</p><p>Hirschur straightened. “You can set up at that table in the corner.”</p><p>Before long, Ferdinand, Rozemyne, and Hirschur sat around a table, eating a delicious lunch of sandwiches and consomme.</p><p>As the professor scarfed down her food, she held up one of the sandwiches and said, “These are delightful. A meal you can eat while you continue your research…”</p><p>Rozemyne smiled. “I developed them for Ferdinand.”</p><p>“Oh ho, what a thoughtful fiance you are.”</p><p>“I thank you ever so much.”</p><p>Ferdinand cleared his throat and started discussing one of his magical tools to distract his mentor. Rozemyne had the most annoying grin all the while.</p><p>Once lunch was cleared, Rozemyne left to return to the library while Ferdinand and Hirschur got back to studying the magic circles. They broke again for dinner and then continued late into the night. It was just before first bell when Ferdinand realized what time it was and left with promises to return the following Earthday. He teleported home, relieved that at least things weren’t any worse than in the previous weave.</p><p> </p><p>Mestionora must have heard his thoughts because the following week threw everything askew. Two days later, he received letters from Rozemyne and Hartmut, saying Gretia wanted to swear her name. While Hartmut expounded upon his surprise that Gretia was the first to step forward and how Rozemyne’s saintly qualities had converted her, Rozemyne instead asked Ferdinand’s thoughts as someone with name sworn retainers. She explained Gretia’s history as a temple-born girl who was adopted by her uncle to be used as a political pawn and how abusive her brothers were. Her compassion made her lean towards accepting, but her lack of understanding caused her to hesitate.</p><p>Tapping his temple, Ferdinand recalled the report Justus had given him on the girl in the first weave. This seemed to be before the sexual assault she suffered, so she would likely be a more versatile attendant if Rozemyne took her in now. She would have little to offer as a spy given how little she was trusted - they were counting on Laurenz to fill that role. However, she was still valuable as another attendant if nothing else. She clearly understood the terrible situation she was in, so she would still view Rozemyne as a savior and serve her faithfully. Having her swear it now, too, rather than under threat of execution, maintained the sanctity of the act, hopefully preventing it from possibly being misused in the future.</p><p>He wrote back to her, saying they could discuss this when she returned for the Dedication Ritual but included more information about what it meant to swear one’s name as well as what it meant to hold one. Meanwhile, he wrote one to Hartmut, instructing him to assist her in gathering what she needed to make her name stone.</p><p>Two days later, he received another letter from Hartmut, stating that Roderick had come forward at Philine’s insistence, saying he wanted to swear loyalty to Rozemyne. Hartmut brought it up to Rozemyne, hinting that she might be able to reword the compression method contract in a way that would appease her guardians and allow Roderick to sign it. He finished by saying he imagined Muriella would come over soon, but Matthais and Laurenz were likely waiting to see how the others were treated first.</p><p>Rozemyne’s lack of letter about Roderick told him she was thinking about how to broach the subject and would bring it up when she returned for the Dedication Ritual.</p><p>…Or so he thought until he received correspondence from her the next day.</p><p>
<em>Ferdinand,</em>
</p><p>
<em>I had tea with Lady Eglantine yesterday, and we met again today for a girls’ outing.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I need to talk to you before the prince summons me. When can I come home?</em>
</p><p>

<p>Ferdinand immediately requested an audience with Sylvester, who told him to come to the office. Karstedt wasn’t present as he was training.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Sylvester asked.</p><p>Ferdinand handed him Rozemyne’s letter. “I need your permission to call her back.”</p><p>He read through it, his face draining of color. “Wh-wh-what did she do? What happened?! Does she mean <em>Klassenberg’s</em> Lady Eglantine?”</p><p>“Yes, <em>that</em> Lady Eglantine, and I have no idea what she did. That is why I need your permission to summon her back to Ehrenfest.”</p><p>He nodded, “Absolutely. Do it immediately. You can have a bit to calm her down, but then bring her here.”</p><p>Ferdinand wrote the order and sent it over. Within a bell, Rozemyne appeared with Cornelius and Rihyarda. All three of them looked troubled, but his fiancé was pale and trembling, much like she had whenever she was wracked with fever. When Ferdinand told Cornelius to return to the academy, he tried to protest, but after Rozemyne reminded him that he wasn’t quite finished with his coursework, she ordered him to return. Reluctantly, he complied, leaving her in the care of Damuel.</p><p>“Come with me,” Ferdinand said, leading her to his office. “Sit.” He handed her a sound-blocking tool. “Explain.”</p><p>Sweat began beading on her brow as her eyes darted around the room. “C-can we go into your hidden room?” she asked, her teeth nearly chattering.</p><p>“Rozemyne, if you feel the need for physical affection, then we will need to summon Elvira.”</p><p>She shook her head. “No, it’s… It’s something I can’t say out here.”</p><p>Ice cold dread gripped his heart. “I understand.” He took the tool back from her and opened the door to his hidden room. When Rihyarda began to protest, he glared at her and said, “There are some things that can only be discussed between archduke candidates.” Before she could say anything further, he closed the door.</p><p>He turned around and felt a weight slam into him, though not hard enough to make him stumble. Rozemyne had thrown herself at him, wrapping her arms around his waist and pressing her forehead against his chest.</p><p>…When had she gotten tall enough to do that? Whenever he read her letters, he still saw her as the little girl who he’d left behind when he went to Ahrensbach. Realizing just how much she’d grown gave him a strange sense of vertigo.</p><p>Gently, he wrapped his arms around her and patted her back. While he burned to start asking her questions, he decided to wait until she was ready to speak. There was no reason to push her needlessly.</p><p>After several long moments, she took a steadying breath and said, “Ferdinand, I… I messed up.”</p><p>His anxiety spiked. “Let’s sit down, and you can tell me what happened.”</p><p>He tried to take the seat across from her, but since she wouldn’t let go of his sleeve, he conceded to sitting next to her instead. At least that was all the touch she seemed to need. Her other hand balled up the fabric of her skirt as she said, “I…I found one of the words that leads to the Book of Mestionora.”</p><p>The breath froze in his lungs as his mind went blank with panic. Once he could find words again, he said, “Explain.”</p><p>“Well, Lady Eglantine invited me for tea, and she was asking me about joining the temple to avoid having to pick a prince to marry.”</p><p>So far, nothing amiss…</p><p>“She thought we were engaged because we were both in the temple, but when I told her I was going to get married either way, she got pretty upset. She was using euphemistic language, but I’m pretty sure she said she was worried about causing another war and that all she wanted was peace.”</p><p>Slight difference from before, but nothing to explain the catastrophically different result.</p><p>“So I, uh, I said why not pray for guidance to help make a choice, and since the Klassenberg dorms were so close to Schutzaria’s shrine, I suggested we go offer prayers. Since praying to Mestionora in the library woke up Schwartz and Weiss, I thought praying in the shrine of the one she served would do…something…”</p><p>“How did you even–” He cut himself off as he recalled the discussion they had when talking about ditter strategies and how they’d used one of his old maps with all the shrine locations marked on it.</p><p>How?! How did such a minor, insignificant bit of knowledge cause such vast ripples?! Had Mestionora decided to personally torment him by leading Rozemyne to that shrine? Was she that impatient to have a Zent?</p><p>“Go on,” he said, trying to place his frustration with that vindictive goddess to the side.</p><p>“Well, we went there this morning, and when Lady Eglantine tried to open the door, it wouldn’t budge, and she got a really weird look on her face.”</p><p>Meaning she’d gone inside.</p><p>All manner of curses filled Ferdinand’s mind as he tried to map out all the implications and downstream effects that would cause.</p><p>“So I tried it next, and it was like I got sucked into the shrine. It looked really different on the inside. A statue of Schutzaria was in the middle, and it had a large yellow feystone.”</p><p>“A feystone, you say?” he asked, his hopes rising dangerously. So Lady Eglantine hadn’t received the tablet, meaning there was a high chance she didn’t understand the true significance of the shrines yet.</p><p>“Yes. Anyway, I felt like I should pray, so I offered my prayers to the gods, asking for protection and the wisdom to…stop giving you headaches…”</p><p>And Mestionora took that personally, obviously. Was this the result of being a perpetual child? Since she never reached adulthood, was she permanently trapped in this juvenile, petty mindset?</p><p>“Some of my mana got sucked out, and the feystone turned into a tablet.” She repeated what it’d said about her obtaining a word to get the Grutrissheit and needing to collect the rest. “I picked it up, and it got absorbed into my divine will. I… I don’t know what to do. Should I tell the prince about it?”</p><p>“NO!” Ferdinand barked before he could stop himself, causing her to startle. “Don’t say a word to him. Either he or Prince Sigiswald will try to break our engagement to claim the throne.”</p><p>Her eyes widened as her grip on his sleeve tightened. “But the king already approved.”</p><p>“And the king needs Grutrissheit. You think a verbal promise to let a couple of archduke candidates in a middle-ranked duchy get married outweighs that?”</p><p>“C-can’t they just get it for themselves once they know how?”</p><p>Ferdinand shook his head. “Tell me what happened after you got the tablet.”</p><p>She paused, blinking her eyes at the slight shift in topic. “Um… Well, I tried to hide that anything was wrong, but she was giving me a curious look, so I knew that despite all my training, my emotions were probably showing, so I apologized for bringing her out into the cold to a shrine whose door wouldn’t open. She got a weird look on her face, so I kind of panicked and said, ‘If I might play Anhaltung to the extent of my meager capabilities, might I suggest sharing your concerns with the prince next you meet?’ I just wanted to distract her, but it seemed to work. She thanked me for the advice, said she would try doing it next time, and we parted ways, but when I was leaving, I saw there was a giant yellow light shooting into the sky. I asked Cornelius about it, but he didn’t see it.”</p><p>So in an ideal world, Eglantine thought only she had gone into the shrine, and while it was a strange experience, there was nothing that would indicate Rozemyne was now the second-closest person to obtaining a full Glutrissheit. Instead, she thought an archduke candidate from the thirteenth-ranked duchy was panicking over wasting the future first queen’s time.</p><p>Never once had this been an ideal world.</p><p>“Who have you told?”</p><p>Rozemyne shook her head. “No one.”</p><p>“What did your retainers have to say?”</p><p>“Rihyarda and Brunhilde tried to console me, saying that Lady Eglantine didn’t seem to be mad, but I could tell they were both barely keeping it together. Hartmut didn’t seem overly concerned about Lady Eglantine but was worried about how I was acting. You saw Cornelius. He’s been about the same since it happened.”</p><p>So none of them had picked up on anything other than the surface-level problem. Of course, since they didn’t even know one could enter the shrines, it would be nearly impossible for them to detect anything deeper.</p><p>Tapping his temple, he leaned back and tried to plan his next moves. “Rozemyne, tell no one of this. If your retainers ask, simply go with the story you’ve already concocted - that you had hoped to enter the shrine to Schutzaria to pray for guidance but that it was locked, and you’re worried you’ve offended Lady Eglantine for wasting her time. If Lady Eglantine brings it up, act surprised if she speaks of anything other than being unable to enter the shrine.”</p><p>She nodded slowly. “What do I tell the pr-prince though?” A shiver went through her, and the barely-concealed look of terror on her face made him tense up.</p><p>“Did you ask her about who was escorting her?”</p><p>“She said a relative from Klassenberg.”</p><p>“Tell him that.”</p><p>“What about the trip today…?”</p><p>Ferdinand sighed. “You’re the Saint of Ehrenfest, aren’t you? Simply tell him that you suggested she offer prayers to the gods, and since you’d heard about the shrine your grandfather had once damaged, you suggested the two of you go there, but since you couldn’t get in, you apologized and parted ways.”</p><p>Though she nodded, she still trembled, her eyes wavering with worry.</p><p>“What aren’t you telling me about the prince?”</p><p>Her hand wrapped around the pendant of her courtship necklace as she muttered, “...He sent my retainers out of the room. It was just the two of us and his head attendant.” She squeezed her eyes shut and said, “I’m sorry! I know you said I shouldn’t be alone with men I’m not related to, but I… I… I’m so sorry!”</p><p>That single-minded buffoon! How dare he pull an engaged girl into his room without any of her attendants or guards present?! Still, at least they weren’t completely alone…</p><p>“Rozemyne, you have no reason to apologize. It was a royal order, and it was not a hidden room.” It didn’t change the fact he wanted to commit regicide, but his fiance was not at fault, so he tried to keep his anger in check so as not to give her the impression he blamed her.</p><p>“About the tablet,” he said, changing the subject, “speak of it to no one.”</p><p>She nodded. “Okay.”</p><p>“And don’t go to the other shrines.” He paused then rubbed at his temples. Keeping information from her had led to this bungle. He would need to share what was necessary to prevent future incidents. “Not yet at least. As you mentioned, the tablet merged with your divine will. In your third year, you’ll perform the divine protection ceremony which will increase the efficiency of your mana. As your schtappe will likely no longer be sufficient to control all of it, you’ll need to collect the other tablets to increase its quality.”</p><p>“So after that, when I collect all the tablets, I’ll be able to read the Book of Mestionora?”</p><p>Ferdinand glared at her and then cursed himself. Of course that was what she was focused on. He should have known. “No, getting the tablets does not automatically get you the book.”</p><p>“But it gets me closer, right?”</p><p>“Rozemyne!”</p><p>“Come on! It’s a book from a goddess! Of course I want to read it! Just let me read it! I won’t tell anyone about it! In fact, I’ll hand it over to the royal family once I’m done with it! I <em>have</em> to read it!”</p><p>“You can’t just–” He groaned and held his head in his hands. He only had himself to blame. This bookfiend would be the death of him. “Rozemyne, forget about the book. Obtaining it will only cause you problems.” And it would keep him from being able to complete his as well.</p><p>When she started to pout, he pinched her cheeks. “You fool! I can see you’re plotting to go behind my back to get the Grutrissheit! Are you incapable of thinking whenever a book is involved? Do I need to lay out for you the consequences of this rampage? You would become a tool of the royal family, taken from Ehrenfest and given to whichever prince they decide should take the throne. Due to your home duchy’s lower status, you would be relegated to third wife and shoved in an out-of-sight villa <em>with no books</em> because none of the royal family members have their own personal collection. While you might occasionally be granted access to the Royal Library, you would spend the majority of your days being used as a mana slave and a slightly-inconvenient Grutrissheit whenever the king decided he needed a border gate filled or a boundary line redrawn. Do you want that book so badly that you’d let them take you away from me?!”</p><p>He froze, his horror at what he’d just said causing him to loosen his grip on her face and stare at her unseeingly as he tried to quickly formulate a plan. How much damage had his thoughtless words just caused? How could he explain away what he’d said? Would she believe him if he said he’d simply misspoken?</p><p>Her forehead slamming into his chest and her arms wrapping around him brought him back to the present. His hands remained suspended in the air as he gazed down at her uncertainly.</p><p>“Is that what you’re afraid of?” she asked, her voice somewhat muffled against his robes. “I’m not going to leave you. You’re my family! Of course you’re more important than any book!”</p><p>His words caught in his throat as he felt a string of tension to sever, letting him relax his arms at last and return the embrace. He had thought he’d have to wait years to hear her say those words again, if ever at all. Finally, once more, he had a family like the one he’d envied since that day he’d met her and her parents in the temple. And this time, it wasn’t given to him just before being ripped away from him.</p><p>After a while, they released each other, and she placed her hands on either side of her on the seat, kicking her feet and gazing off to one side of the room.</p><p>Ferdinand took one look at her and sighed. “...You still want to read it, don’t you?”</p><p>“...Yes.”</p><p>He pinched her cheek again.</p><p> </p><p>They met in Aub Ehrenfest’s office where Rozemyne gave the redacted version of the story she and Ferdinand had discussed in his hidden room. While it obviously made Sylvester want to pull his hair, he agreed it wasn’t as bad as it could have been, and though both he and Ferdinand wanted to keep her in Ehrenfest, they were more concerned about earning the prince’s ire by making her fail to report as ordered.</p><p>Before the meeting ended, Ferdinand decided he needed something to distract his brother so he wouldn’t get questioned about why it had taken so long to bring Rozemyne to him. “Rozemyne, you wrote about accepting some of the Former Veronica Faction children as retainers.”</p><p>“You <em>WHAT?!</em>” Sylvester bellowed.</p><p>She winced at his outburst and shot Ferdinand a petulant look. “Well, I’d like to talk about it in more detail <em>later</em>, but I think if we reword the compression method contract, I could accept more retainers. I already don’t have enough, and I’m too limited if I don’t take any from the children of that faction. They were the largest one in Ehrenfest, no? And children don’t get to pick factions.” She went on to detail the benefits of letting them learn her compression method now while they were still in their growth period and that the contract wouldn’t let them betray her. “Plus, there are some who…aren’t treated well by their parents.”</p><p>“And so the Saint of Ehrenfest wants to extend her mercy,” Sylvester sighed. “I’m going to have to think about this, but did you have any wording in mind? The rest of your guardians and I can look it over while you’re back at the academy.”</p><p>The main difference in the contract was that the signer would agree to join whatever faction Rozemyne belonged to upon their coming of age and continue to follow her should the faction change.</p><p>Sylvester’s brows shot up. “That sounds like you’re planning to make a separate faction outside of Charlotte’s.”</p><p>“That’s not my intent at all,” Rozemyne said. “I can’t have them swear allegiance to the Florencia Faction as its name will change once Charlotte is aub, right? I can’t predict what other name changes will occur in the future, but whatever faction supports her is the one I’ll be in, as I’ve already publicly stated. This is also a failsafe in case Charlotte decides to marry outside the duchy and Melchior becomes aub instead.”</p><p>“Then why not have them swear to join the faction supporting the aub?”</p><p>Rozemyne’s gaze flicked to Ferdinand as she placed a troubled hand on her cheek before she cast her eyes down. “If someone had done that when you were first made aub, couldn’t they have been ordered to kill Ferdinand with the justification that he could technically take the seat from you?”</p><p>That gave Sylvester pause while Ferdinand tapped his temple. The contracts weren’t as controlling as name stones, but he could see her reasoning. If the head of the faction supporting the aub gave a direct order, it could very well cost them their life to disobey.</p><p>“Okay, but why you?” Sylvester asked.</p><p>She shrugged. “It’s my compression method, and they’ll be my retainers.”</p><p>“Hmm… I get the thought process… Okay, we’ll have to talk about it. You can spend the day here resting and go back in the morning. Charlotte’s been dying to see you.”</p><p>“Okay!” Rozemyne said with a brilliant smile, practically bounding from the room when she was dismissed. She did at least start acting appropriately when she opened the door, so Ferdinand couldn’t complain too much, though it still annoyed him to see her so openly show emotion in front of other men.</p><p>Once she was gone, Sylvester sighed and scratched his head. “What do you make of this?”</p><p>Ferdinand shrugged, hiding his smirk at a plan well laid. “I think she makes a fair point with the number of retainers she’s currently limited to, and the reports from the winter playroom and the Royal Academy indicate there are a number of Former Veronica Faction children who want to swear loyalty to her but are prevented by their parents’ faction. Also…”</p><p>Sylvester looked up and leaned forward. “What?”</p><p>With a smirk, he answered, “One of them is Giebe Gerlach’s youngest son.”</p><p>“You’re not seriously considering him!”</p><p>“I am,” Ferdinand said. “We couldn’t ask for a better means of collecting evidence against the man, and since he seems to be at the head of the Georgine Faction…”</p><p>“And you seriously think this could work?” Sylvester asked. “I mean, we’re asking him to betray his father. Even if he signs that contract, there’s no guarantee he won’t try to do the same to one of us.”</p><p>“He already decided to betray his father when he started considering joining Rozemyne. We merely need to point him in the direction most beneficial to us.”</p><p>Sylvester tapped his fingers against his desk, furrowing his brows as he contemplated the situation. “Alright, see if you can come up with some airtight wording for that contract, and then we’ll talk.”</p><p>“Very well. In the meantime, I would like to ask permission to send Justus to the Royal Academy to watch over Rozemyne since she is meeting with royalty and may continue making contact with archduke candidates from greater duchies.”</p><p>“Huh? Doesn’t she have Rihyarda with her?”</p><p>“Rihyarda doesn’t read lips.”</p><p>“Oh, right, and he makes a pretty convincing Gudrun, too!” He broke into a fit of snorts and chuckles before he got control of himself and shook his head. “He can’t be her attendant, though, since she can only have one adult with her.”</p><p>Ferdinand shrugged. “Send him as Traugott’s attendant. He can do the bare minimum for appearance’s sake, then spend the rest of the time supporting Rozemyne and gathering intel.”</p><p>“Hmm… Yeah, that could work. Sure, do it.”</p><p>Once Ferdinand was dismissed, he went to his office and sent an ordonnanz summoning his scholar. Justus arrived with the swiftness of Steifebrise, having obviously abandoned whatever family duty he’d been seeing to. “You called, my lord?”</p><p>“Yes, I have a job for you. I’m going to need you to infiltrate the Royal Academy.”</p><p>The grin on Justus’ face was equal parts mischievous and eager. “What would you have me do, my lord?”</p><p> </p><p>While bidding farewell to Rozemyne left Ferdinand feeling somewhat bereft, seeing the misery on Traugott’s face as Justus dragged him onto the teleportation circle brightened his mood considerably.</p>

<p>Justus’ first report came the next day, written in code that Ferdinand deciphered in his hidden room.</p><p>
<em>My lord,</em>
</p><p>
<em>It truly is something else seeing what Milady’s done with the dorm. All the kids really are acting like a single faction. I’ve started training the scholars as you’ve suggested. Hartmut is proving useful in his assistance. Wilfried continues to lead the knights, though he’s ceding training to Leonore who is making a study of each apprentice’s strengths, weaknesses, and limitations. I have recorded them here:</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand skipped deciphering that information until later.</p><p>
<em>One bell after our return, a summons from the prince arrived. Milady has a meeting scheduled three days from now. My mother will be acting as her head attendant.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I have managed to gather the following pieces of information:</em>
</p><p>
<em>-Lady Eglantine prefers honey pound cake.<br/>-The price of sugar is expected to increase by an unknown margin.<br/>-Dunkelfelger is seeking a rematch with Ehrenfest. Leonore is planning to accept when Milady returns so the knight apprentices will be forced to see their shortcomings without besmirching her honor.<br/>-Clarissa, a scholar from Dunkelfelger, is gathering information on milady’s male retainers.<br/>-Laynoble scholars and attendants from nearly every duchy are taking on crest-certified work for Milady.<br/>-Hirschur has a low-manaed disciple.<br/>-Professors have taken an interest in plant paper. Drewanchel may be experimenting with it.<br/>-Rinsham continues to be a popular topic, though only Lady Eglantine has been given a sample so far.<br/>-The collection sites are rumored to be in a poorer state than when we attended.</em>
</p><p>The list went on, many details not of much immediate use, though the price of sugar piqued his interest. Was that Ahrensbach or Lanzanave pulling the strings?</p><p>The next report came two days later with three key pieces of information:</p><p>Lady Eglantine had a face flushed with cold as though she’d been outside for an extended period of time.</p><p>She had visited the library.</p><p>The prince was visibly upset.</p><p>Ferdinand rubbed his temples as he put the pieces together. Eglantine had gone back to the shrine, no doubt, but had she collected the tablet? Did she go to the library looking for Rozemyne? There was no mention of Eglantine sending an invitation to her, so she hadn’t gone to the library thinking she’d been ignored. She wouldn’t have gone to maintain secrecy, either, since the library would be becoming more populated this time of year, and Rozemyne always had a sharp-eyed entourage with her. Even those Hartmut was brainwashing from the Former Veronica Faction had been going to the library on the same days as Rozemyne, so there were even more eyes on her than normal.</p><p>Had she gone to find out the locations of the shrines, perhaps? That information was likely only to be found in the underground library, which was inaccessible at the moment. Perhaps she went to question Solange about it?</p><p>Slightly less troubling was the prince’s attitude. Was he upset with having to wait to speak to Rozemyne after her tea party with Eglantine, or had something else occurred to put him in a sour mood? It was possible he’d approached Eglantine in the interim, but it was highly unlikely considering he had sent Rozemyne to investigate on his behalf and had yet to hear the result.</p><p>Sighing heavily, he penned his response to Justus.</p><p>
<em>Justus,</em>
</p><p>
<em>Continue to monitor Eglantine and the prince. Be sure to go with Rozemyne to her meeting with him.</em>

<em>– Ferdinand</em>
</p><p>While he waited for Justus’ report, he got back to work training the blue priests and looking at the compression method contract. It was no small matter to change the wording since it would have to accommodate everyone who’d already signed, and as he was planning to leave the duchy with Rozemyne in the future, everyone who signed would have to join an Alexandrian faction, even if they were still in Ehrenfest. The stipulation that the signer could not turn against Rozemyne was simply not enough to ensure her or Ehrenfest’s safety should bad actors try to take advantage.</p><p><em>They’ll just have to swear their names,</em> Ferdinand thought. It wasn’t ideal, given Roderick was still a first year, but Ferdinand himself was quite young when he made his own name stone. Hartmut would be able to see the boy through making it, especially as he was doing the same for Gretia already.</p><p>The major drawback was that Hartmut would never cease antagonizing any of the name sworn until Rozemyne accepted his as well, and she likely wouldn’t until forced by circumstance.</p><p>The next day, Justus’ report on the meeting with the prince arrived.</p><p>
<em>My lord,</em>
</p><p>
<em>This amulet is beyond anything I could have imagined! No one even suspected I was hidden among Milady’s retainers, nor did they sense my presence even inside the sound-blocking barrier. Are you certain you won’t let me use this more freely? Think of all the intelligence I could gather for you!</em>
</p><p>“Not a chance,” Ferdinand muttered. He didn’t want to consider what trouble his attendant would get into with unfettered access to the amulet of Verbergen.</p><p>
<em>Milady was summoned to the prince’s meeting room, and it was cleared of all save his head attendant (and myself under the cloak of Verbergen). Though Milady was undoubtedly nervous, she showed no sign of it. She’s really come a long way with Elvira’s tutoring.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Here was their conversation -</em>
</p><p>
<em>Prince: Well? What do you have for me? Who’s escorting her?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Milady: My, it is quite uncomfortable having to report on words spoken privately between ladies.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Prince: This is an order.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Milady: I understand. I shall not dance with Grammaratur, then. She has stated she will ask a family member from Klassenberg to escort her.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Prince: She always says that! How useless can you be?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Milady: My deepest apologies for not being able to provide you with the answer you sought.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Prince: Did she give no indication about which of us she’ll choose, me or my brother?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Milady: I must offer my sincerest apologies again, for she did not share such information with me. If I may be forgiven for saying so, we simply are not close enough after a mere two tea parties to divulge such secrets to each other.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Prince: Ha? Did you not spend the morning with her the following day, going galavanting off through the snow?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Milady: We simply went to offer our prayers to the gods.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Prince: What nonsense is this?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Milady: Forgive me, but that is truly what happened.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Prince: Really? Why did you have to go out in the snow to pray?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Milady: I was told of a shrine my grandfather had damaged during his time here, though it has since been repaired. We went to the shrine to offer our prayers, but the door was locked.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Prince: I will have to confirm the location of this shrine.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Milady: I shall have one of my retainers share it with you.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Prince: Why were you offering prayers?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Milady: For guidance. As a prayer to Mestionora offered in the library resulted in a blessing that reactivated the magic tools, it seemed only natural to assume prayers offered in a shrine dedicated to the gods would also grant blessings.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Prince: I keep hearing of these blessings. Perform one for me.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Milady: As you wish…</em>
</p><p>
<em>Milady then sang a song to Schutzaria, asking for protection, and she gave a modest blessing, by her standards, at any rate. The prince was enamored.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Prince: I see now why your Ewigeliebe covers you in ice. You’re wasted on Ehrenfest.</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand leapt to his feet, knocking several documents to the floor. Had that arrogant, insignificant whelp just threatened to take Rozemyne from him? He would tear the country apart before he let anyone in the royal family take his Geduldh. Not again. <em>Never</em> again.</p><p>Taking a few steadying breaths, he sat back down and tried to regain his sense of calm. He had a new concern to address now - Rozemyne’s response. It was entirely likely she didn’t understand what the prince had meant.</p><p>
<em>Milady: I thank you ever so much, but my light only shines in Ehrenfest. It both is and holds my Geduldh.</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand smiled, glad to be included along with her family in her Geduldh.</p><p>
<em>Prince: And just how did your Ewigeliebe convince you to become his Geduldh?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Milady: My future God of Darkness proposed to me by offering me my heart’s desire.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Prince: Which was?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Milady: Books! An entire library to be exact!</em>
</p><p>
<em>Prince: You can’t be serious.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Milady: Oh, but I am! Is there any gesture more romantic than giving your Goddess of Light a library?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Prince: Perhaps you’re not as wasted on Ehrenfest as I originally thought.</em>
</p><p>Thank the gods for Rozemyne’s strange obsession! Her gremlin-like ways might have just saved Yurgenschmidt.</p><p>
<em>This conversation has not been a complete waste of my time. Propose with her heart’s desire…</em>
</p><p>
<em>The prince dismissed her after that.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Miladay returned to the library without further incident. Roderick, Matthias, and Laurenz were there once again. Hartmut used the opportunity to have Gretia make transcriptions so she could pay knight apprentices to assist her with gathering ingredients for her name stone.</em>
</p><p>
<em>One of Eglantine’s scholars was also there. She was asking Professor Solange for resources on the history of the academy.</em>
</p><p>She was looking for the other shrines. Ferdinand rubbed his temples and sighed. If she managed to get the Book of Mestionora, then the gods would have their Zent, and they would leave him alone. Hopefully, she would read it and discover the history behind the royal family and send them off to govern abandoned duchies, but this was also a child so concerned with her notion of peace that she had to be strong armed into becoming Zent in the last weave after giving her name to Rozemyne.</p><p>…It was awfully convenient having leverage over the Zent, but he’d rather have Eglantine become a true Zent than have Mestionora descend on Rozemyne again. Of course, it was a moot point if Eglantine refused the throne out of fear of causing another war.</p><p>Well, if the gods wanted their Zent, they could be the ones to talk her out of her foolishness. Let them clean up their own mess for once. It wasn’t as if he were in a position to tell her that with the Glutrissheit, the only duchy that wouldn’t back her was Ahrensbach, and only because Georgine’s insane obsession with Ehrenfest led to Raublut attempting to let Gervasio usurp the throne. It would be a simple matter to close the border gate and solve that problem. Convincing her of the need to do so without any evidence other than his memories of the past weave would be nigh impossible, but Dregarnuhr could see to it if saving the garden was that important to her.</p><p>If the fabric followed that possible weaving, then he’d have to reformulate some plans, but at least the garden as a whole would cease to be his problem.</p><p> </p><p>The following Earthday, Ferdinand was greeted by Rozemyne and Wilfried as usual before he went to Hirschur’s lab. When he entered, he found Raimund, busily working away at a magic circle.</p><p>“Hirschur,” he said, “I see you’ve taken in an Ahrensbach student.”</p><p>She looked up from her materials and raised a brow at him. “I would expect you to be the last person to question my judgment on who I choose as a disciple.”</p><p>He sighed and walked to one of the shelves, gathering magic tools and documents he didn’t want leaked back to Ahrensbach, even though he knew Raimund wasn’t the security risk he appeared to be. At least, not for Ehrenfest.</p><p>“I’ll take these back with me, then.”</p><p>“E-excuse me,” the boy stammered, walking forward with his shoulders hunched and his eyes shining with awe. “Are you <em>the</em> Lord Ferdinand.”</p><p>“Indeed.”</p><p>He gasped, breaking into a smile. “I’m Raimund of Ahrensbach. I’ve always admired your work! You’re something of a role model for me. C-could you take me a-a-as you d-d-disciple?”</p><p>Well, who was he to deny a chance to start gathering intel on Ahrensbach early? “What’s your specialty?”</p><p>“I make mana circles more efficient so people with lower amounts of mana can still use them.”</p><p>“I see. I shall devise a series of tests. Should you pass them, I will consider accepting you.”</p><p>“Really?!”</p><p>“I do not like to repeat myself.”</p><p>“Ah, y-yes! Yes, Lord Ferdinand! My apologies!” The boy hunched over like a dog being scolded, but his expression belied his excitement.</p><p>After returning the tools and documents to Justus to handle, he went back to Hirschur’s lab and got to work pretending to decipher the shumils’ magic circles and trying to find new ways to utilize them. Raimund, meanwhile, was given the task of making one of the protection circles he and Hirschur had created a couple of weeks prior mana-efficient enough that even he could use it. The boy would greatly benefit from the Rozemyne Compression Method, but Ferdinand had no way to offer it to him. There was simply no method to secure him before he came of age unless he had Rozemyne take Ahrensbach much earlier than planned, but that simply would not be possible for multiple reasons.</p><p>Once again, he lost track of time and ended up leaving the lab just before attendants were due to rise. As he entered the Ehrenfest dorm, Justus met him with a sound-blocking tool.</p><p>“What is it?” Ferdinand asked, dread sinking into his stomach.</p><p>“Lady Eglantine went to the library today and saw Milady. They didn’t exchange words since Milady never looked up from her book, but Lady Eglantine said, ‘You really are a little Mestionora, aren’t you?’ It seemed like something you’d want to know.”</p><p>Ferdinand cursed. That was…less than ideal.</p>

<p>Ferdinand tried to get Rozemyne to come home earlier, but several of her retainers begged him to let her stay for Angelica’s sake. She had one more class to pass, and her exam wouldn’t take place for another five days. Apparently, they had agreed that if Angelica passed her written classes before Rozemyne returned, she would get the fourth step of the mana compression method. Without that incentive, she would likely not graduate, and he was loath to give up a knight willing to hold a blade even against him to protect Rozemyne.</p><p>He eventually got her to agree to read in the dormitory at least. Hartmut would be in charge of retrieving books for her from the library as well as providing Solange with feystones filled with Rozemyne’s mana…for the small price of being able to keep a tiny one for himself. Since this was in addition to Justus’ training, his brainwashing campaign, and his help with creating name stones, Ferdinand decided to concede, so long as he never told Rozemyne about it.</p><p>According to reports from Justus and Rozemyne, Eglantine invited her to tea, but since she was returning for the Dedication Ritual, she had to refuse. Eglantine followed up by sending a letter asking if she knew of any other shrines in case they were unlocked so she could offer prayers for guidance, but Rozemyne told her she only knew of the one because of the story with her grandfather.</p><p>It was a small comfort knowing she hadn’t found the others. He just hoped she believed Rozemyne’s lie.</p><p>When Rozemyne at last arrived home, Ferdinand felt a weight fall from his shoulders.</p><p>“ROZEMYNE!!!”</p><p>And the weight was suddenly back as Bonifatius charged forward and lifted up Rozemyne, spinning her around and delighting in her screams of terror.</p><p>Everyone yelled at him, startling him enough to release his grip and send her flying. “Wha??? Rozemyne’s flying to the ceiling!!”</p><p>Cornelius had been lunging for his grandfather and thus would have to change direction before he leapt for her, meaning he would be too late.</p><p>Ferdinand only realized this after his back hit the ceiling as he secured Rozemyne in his arms. He landed lightly on his feet and yelled, “YOU FOOL!! She would have died if not for my intervention! Have you learned nothing?!”</p><p>“She’s not a knight like the rest of us!” Cornelius shouted.</p><p>“Father, Rozemyne may be healthier after her jureve, but she’s still a frail little girl! She only just removed her enhancement magic tools!”</p><p>Meanwhile, Sylvester was clutching his chest as he leaned with one hand against the wall. “Thank the gods Ferdinand caught her… I seriously thought I was about to watch my adoptive daughter die!”</p><p>Florencia and Elvira stood pale-faced, gaping mouths covered with trembling hands, both of them at a loss for words.</p><p>Bonifatius scratched his head as he started to plod over, but Karstedt and Cornelius held him back. “I’m sorry, Rozemyne…”</p><p>“It’s okay, Grandfather,” She said in a shaky voice. “As you can see, I’m quite fine.” Her hand still held one of Ferdinand’s sleeves in a death grip, however. He readjusted it to make it appear as much like he was escorting her as possible.</p><p>She offered perfunctory greetings before he walked her to her rooms, her retainers following close behind. “I am ever so excited to see Charlotte,” She said, the tremor in her voice barely noticeable. “How many days will we be in the castle before we go to the temple?”</p><p>“We’ll go in a week’s time.”</p><p>“Might I ask why you took me away from the Royal Academy library so early?”</p><p>With a heavy sigh, he said, “Can you truly not understand the reason? Has my education been that lacking, or do you simply forget anything not related to books? Shall we start over from the beginning? I don’t have time to waste, so I’ll have to provide you with potions to let you forgo sleep.”</p><p>“NO! No, that won’t be necessary. Ohohoho~”</p><p>He passed her a sound-blocking tool and said, “Were you not able to avoid a tea party with Lady Eglantine thanks to your early departure?”</p><p>“That’s true, but since archduke candidates don’t go to the library, I was perfectly safe there.”</p><p>“Fool! Did you not realize she’s been there twice now? She even approached you once!”</p><p>“What?! When? Why don’t I remember this?”</p><p>He sighed again, rubbing his temple with his free hand. “You must learn to be more self aware. If someone wanted to kill, capture, or attack you, they’d simply need to lay a book on the floor, and you’d blissfully leave yourself unguarded.”</p><p>“Isn’t that what all the charms are for?” she asked, tilting her head to the side.</p><p>This fool would send him up the towering staircase yet. As he prepared to deliver another lecture, he caught the amused smirk on her face. This little…!</p><p>He pulled her into her room by her cheek and hissed, “How much time do you think I’ve spent trying to keep you safe? Do you plan to undo all my work? Shall I just take back the protective charms I’ve given you?”</p><p>She widened her eyes and wrapped her hand around her courtship necklace as she begged him to let go. Once he’d had his fill, he released her and healed her face. As she backed away from him, she grabbed her hair stick with her free hand and said, “I’m never giving these back to you, no matter what you say!”</p><p>He scoffed at her. “I merely have to place a book before you, and you’d be so distracted you wouldn’t even notice if I took them.”</p><p>“I would! I would! You can’t take them! These are too precious to me!”</p><p>Cornelius gave a loud cough, bringing Ferdinand’s attention to the room as a whole, which allowed him to see the sound-blocking tool Rozemyne had been holding bouncing along on the ground. The tips of his ears warmed, and he cleared his throat before saying, “Since you’re here during winter socializing, you’ll be meeting with several nobles, most notably Giebe Haldenzel and Giebe Ilgner.” He motioned for her to pick up the sound-blocking tool before activating his again and said, “While you’re here, try to find the man with gray eyes, the one who poisoned you.”</p><p>“I’ll do my best.”</p><p>“Very well.” He took the sound-blocking tool back from Rozemyne and put the set away. “I will leave you to unpack.” With that, he left, heading for his office. There was much work he needed to catch up on.</p><p> </p><p>Later that week, an ordonnanz alighted on his desk and said in Rozemyne’s voice, “I found him.”</p><p>He replied, “Come to my office.”</p><p>When she arrived, she looked stricken, and he could understand why. For her, it hadn’t been that long since she was poisoned, though it was two years for everyone else. Once he turned on the area sound-blocking tool, he asked, “Who was it?”</p><p>“Cornelius assures me it’s Giebe Gerlach.”</p><p>The idiot should have covered his entire face and used a magic circle to see through the cloth. Again, it was always the small things with him.</p><p>Even so, he doubted it would be enough to move Sylvester’s hand. The evidence would have to be convincing enough to keep the Georgine and Former Veronica Factions from rising up, and regardless of how long it had been for Rozemyne, it’d been too long for anyone else to fully trust her memories of a pair of eyes in the dark.</p><p>That was no reason not to move forward with other plans, however.</p><p>“Rozemyne, you know what this will mean for his family, don’t you?”</p><p>She gulped and nodded. “I do.”</p><p>“Are you ready to talk about name swearing?”</p><p>Her head tilted in confusion until her eyes widened with understanding. “If someone is name sworn to me, will they still get punished by association?”</p><p>“No, they’ll be under your care, not their family’s. They would move into the castle. However, unbaptized children cannot swear names, nor can we ask them to sign contracts they don’t understand as they might unintentionally break them, especially with no true guardian to mind them.”</p><p>“Can’t we spare the children?” she asked. “They haven’t done anything wrong!”</p><p>Ferdinand fought the urge to hold his head in his hands. He did not want to have this argument again. “Think this through, Rozemyne. We save them from their parents’ punishment. Then what? Most will not want to take in a child of criminals, especially ones who were executed.” He went on to detail the financial and political issues with saving the children, using what he’d heard from her retainers in the past weave to explain what sort of life they could expect to lead.</p><p>“But they’d be alive,” she said, as though it were the simplest thing in the world.</p><p>“Don’t overextend your reach. Are you going to save every orphaned noble?”</p><p>That gave her pause.</p><p>They continued to go back and forth, but as she wouldn’t budge, he eventually decided to tell her she would have to convince Aub Ehrenfest when the time came.</p><p>“Until then, you wanted to learn more about name swearing?” he asked.</p><p>At her nod, he motioned Justus to step forward, who told Rozemyne he chose to swear his name in order to serve Ferdinand, the only person who could put to use all the information he gathered. Eckhart shared his motivations as well, going on about how wonderful his lord was. Ferdinand nearly ordered him to silence. It was like listening to another Hartmut, just slightly less fanatical.</p><p>When they were finished, Ferdinand motioned for them to step out of the field and to turn around. As Rozemyne’s retainers could not read lips, he didn’t ask her to have them do the same.</p><p>“Rozemyne, as you know, Veronica made many attempts on my life nearly from the moment I stepped into Ehrenfest. I do not trust easily, so I would not accept Justus, Eckhart, or Lasfam as my retainers until they swore their names. Name sworn cannot physically harm their master, though a disloyal person who was forced to give their name could find other means to betray them, such as giving false information or spreading rumors.</p><p>“Children from the Former Veronica Faction must be treated in the same manner. No one in your faction will trust them, neither your retainers nor your family. If you were to try to accept them without holding their names, even if you somehow convinced your guardians to agree, they would face ostracism at best and hostility at worst among your retainers. Even if they’re name sworn, there will be a divide between them, though given your talents, you could break down those walls over time.”</p><p>Rozemyne looked at her clasped hands for a long while, considering. “I don’t want to hold someone’s life in my hands, though.”</p><p>“Do you not already?”</p><p>Her head snapped up. “What do you mean?”</p><p>Nodding slightly to Cornelius, Angelica, and Damuel, he said, “Are your guard knights not prepared to give their lives to protect you? In this regard, I fail to see any difference.”</p><p>She blinked for several moments before nodding slowly. “I… I suppose I shall accept the names of those in the Former Veronica Faction if they choose to give them to me. I… I assume Gerlach will not be the only one implicated, will he?”</p><p>“Likely not.”</p><p>“How much time do I have?”</p><p>“At least until the interduchy tournament, as far as the children attending the academy are concerned.”</p><p>Her face paled, but she nodded with determination.</p><p> </p><p>Wilfried came back the day after Ferdinand and Rozemyne returned to the temple, and he and Charlotte came after lunch to help with the Dedication Ritual. Thanks to having two extra archduke candidates along with Rozemyne’s extra mana from her lack of clumps and two extra seasons of compression, they finished within three days without over-taxing anyone.</p><p>“Huh, if it goes by this quick, then Charlotte and I can come back for the whole thing next year!” Wilfried said after he’d returned from changing out of his ceremonial robes.</p><p>Ferdinand nodded. “Yes, I should think all three of you could leave the academy for a couple of days without causing disruption.”</p><p>“Well, I’m supposed to be back the whole week, so I’ve got a few more days here. I think I’ll go see Melchior while I’m here and maybe train with the knights. What will you do, Rozemyne?”</p><p>“I have several meetings to attend regarding the printing industry.”</p><p>“Sounds rough.”</p><p>She gave him a noble smile. “To create a world full of books demands sacrifice.”</p><p>“You sure are crazy about your books…”</p><p>“Dear Sister,” Charlotte interpreted, “I wish to have a tea party with you again.”</p><p>Ferdinand gave Fran a look, and he stepped forward to usher the children toward the High Bishop’s chambers. That left Ferdinand to get a little paperwork and plotting done before he had to endure winter socializing again.</p><p> </p><p>Rozemyne received so many invitations for meetings that Ferdinand and Elvira had trouble organizing them all for the brief period she would be in Ehrenfest this weave. Since she had not meddled in the prince’s romantic affairs, she would undoubtedly have another summons from him, so even if he desired it, Ferdinand could not hold her back from the Royal Academy until the interduchy tournament.</p><p>“Shall we have her meet Giebes Haldenzel and Ilgner on this day and Groschel the next?”</p><p>“Yes, that should give her enough time to prepare for your tea party that afternoon. We should reject Giebe Leisegang, but these two should be fine for discussing establishing paper workshops.”</p><p>“She’ll only have time for one before she returns. I want to spend time training her a bit more given the people she’s been meeting with at the academy,” Elvira said.</p><p>Ferdinand nodded. “In that case, let’s limit it to just the first two giebes and then have her with you, Charlotte, and Florencia the rest of the time. She can switch between you three depending on who has time or a tea party she can attend.”</p><p>That decided, they finalized their plans and prepared for a hectic week.</p><p>Of the two of them, only Elvira was present for the meeting with Giebe Haldenzel, but both of them accompanied Rozemyne to her meeting with Giebe Ilgner. It provided the same as last time more or less with Ferdinand making plans to purchase the nanseb paper from the Plantin Company. Using Rozemyne’s experiments from the past as a basis, he wanted to see if he could combine it with trombe paper to create something fireproof that came together a little more quickly. He also wanted to try to increase the nanseb paper’s speed alone and test how far away the torn pieces would need to be before they stopped moving toward each other or what barriers would prevent it. It could prove useful in obtaining evidence.</p><p>Like last time, the Lord of Winter appeared while they were talking with Giebe Ilgner, so after Rozemyne gave the entire order Angriff’s blessing, they went to battle.</p><p>The blizzards surrounding the Lord of Winter were bitter and unrelenting. “A schnestrum, just like last time,” Ferdinand said.</p><p>Karstedt replied, “Well, that was a couple of years ago.”</p><p>That hadn’t been what he meant, but he nodded anyway. While the fight would be long, they’d at least be able to get decent ingredients from it, unlike when they’d been gathering ingredients for Rozemyne’s jureve. Plus, he’d effectively be harvesting from two schnestrums since the gods had sent him back with the materials from the first weave.</p><p>“Shall we?” he called. At Karstedt’s nod, he directed the medknights to clean up the snow feybeasts born of the schnestrum’s mana while he along with the archknights attacked the Lord of Winter directly. They slashed and stabbed, but each wound healed as the smaller feybeasts were slain. It was a battle of attrition, their only purpose at this point in the fight to reduce the beast’s mana. Only once it was low enough would they begin to harvest its parts.</p><p>If all they were doing was whittling down its mana, however, Ferdinand saw no reason not to learn from Rozemyne’s out-of-standard thinking. He ordered Karstedt and Eckhart to distract it as best they could while he flew around behind it. Being High Priest for a number of years, he’d donated more than enough mana to receive the spells to manifest the gods’ divine instruments. With a word, he drew in close to the Lord of Winter’s neck, summoned the God of Darkness’ cloak, and spread it along one of its dark stripes. It might as well have been invisible, especially in the storm.</p><p>The cloak immediately began absorbing the feybeast’s mana, causing it to rampage all the more in an attempt to buck off the cape, but it held fast to its neck.</p><p>“What did you do?” Karstedt yelled, trying to be heard over the storm.</p><p>Ferdinand shot him a smirk. “This should end sooner than anticipated!”</p><p>Once the blizzard began to weaken, he swept down again, pulled back his schtappe, and transformed it once again into a sword. “Time to gather!”</p><p>By the end, they had more than enough skin, meat, and bones to distribute among the knights. He took most of the claws for himself along with a few of the teeth and one of the eyes. His mind reeled with the research he could conduct with these materials.</p><p>As planned, no one was able to see what he’d done. The story being passed along by the knights was that he’d stabbed it in the back of the neck, likely with some foul poison that weakened it.</p><p>Last time, they’d been gone for three days. This time, the battle ended in one. While he was glad to be done with the hunt, his early return would mean an earlier meeting with Sylvester.</p><p>Rozemyne’s emotional stability was about to plummet.</p><p> </p><p>Upon his return, he went to see Rozemyne, knowing she couldn’t leave the Northern Building until her knights had finished recovering. She welcomed him with his preferred tea and tea leaf cookies.</p><p>“Ferdinand, while I am glad you wished to see me so soon after your arrival, do you not need to recover?”</p><p>Ah, this was her way of saying, <em>Did you really just come here straight after hunting the Lord of Winter to lecture me? Couldn’t I have enjoyed my peace a little longer?</em></p><p>“Your concern is touching, but I assure you, I am fine.” They glared at each other through their smiles while they sipped their tea.</p><p>Once she set down her cup, she placed a hand on her cheek and said, “Might I ask why you’ve come to see me today? I can’t imagine what was so urgent, but I will do what I am able to assist in whatever is troubling you.”</p><p>Translation: <em>I haven’t done anything to deserve a lecture!</em></p><p>He set his cup down as well and replied, “We need to discuss your upcoming meeting with Sylvester.” He passed her a sound-blocking tool, which she hesitantly accepted. “I need you to understand something, Rozemyne. Though you will be canceling the contract with Benno and Lutz, your relationship with them will not change.”</p><p>Her eyes widened for a moment before becoming somewhat melancholy as she nodded.</p><p>“I… I understand what the contract meant to you,” he said, trying to find the appropriate words while Rihyarda and Ottilie watched on. Angelica’s gaze didn’t bother him, as she likely couldn’t even discern why their lips were silently moving.</p><p>With a heavy sigh, he continued, “You are only selling the rights to produce and sell paper, correct?”</p><p>She nodded. “Not the technologies. I need to ensure the Plantin Company and those who send craftsmen to train others receive proper compensation.”</p><p>“I trust you’ve already spoken with Elivra about the scholars?”</p><p>“Yes, I will train med- and layscholars from the provinces since they are used to speaking with commoners, unlike those here in the noble district.”</p><p>“I see. Very good.” That made her smile, which lightened his mood a little. “You understand, then, that this new contract is necessary and that effectively, nothing will change, correct?”</p><p>“I… I know,” she said, lowering her eyes, all traces of her earlier joy gone.</p><p>He nodded and rested his forearms on the table, lacing his fingers together, “If you understand, then let us discuss details.”</p><p>The two of them went over the number of duchies they could open trade to, the state of the lower city, ways to bring it up to standard, and the terms she wanted to negotiate for on behalf of the Plantin Company. While he would not steal her opportunity to do what she did best, he would get ahead of her anger this time and keep her from saying things in a way she shouldn’t. It was important that she learn how to show the proper respect to those above her while still getting what she wanted. Few would overlook her directness now that she no longer looked like a recently-baptized child. Even now, she was beginning to take on more womanly characteristics. She would no longer enjoy the benefits of apparent youth.</p><p> </p><p>Several days later, Rozemyne had her meeting with Sylvester where they hashed out the details of the new contract and the plans for the lower city, though this time she benefited from Ferdinand’s knowledge in making her suggestions for how to handle the clean up. While he hadn’t handed her the answers they’d come to last time, he’d discussed options with her, telling her why each would or wouldn’t work from the noble side while she argued for the commoner side. This prepared her to deal with the scholars without becoming incensed.</p><p> </p><p>In the last weave, Rozemyne had summoned the Plantin Company a bit earlier than the rest of the merchants to go over Benno’s documents before meeting with the aub, though this was done in the presence several scholars, which forced her to act properly but caused some emotional instability the next day. He had her arrange a meeting before the one with the scholars to allow her to process her extreme emotions before having to step into her noble persona for the next. As such, they went back to the temple for the day so they could meet in the orphanage director’s chambers.</p><p>Ferdinand also came to the meeting, which put her on edge. Her eyes said, <em>Hey!The whole point of this meeting was so we can talk more openly! We can’t do that with you here!</em></p><p>He smirked at her and waited for Benno to complete his greetings. Of her noble retainers, only Damuel and Angelica were present, and the latter was on the first floor guarding the door as though it might attack if not watched. Ferdinand had also ensured only Fran and Gil were present. Her other temple retainers had been conveniently assigned to do work in the High Bishop’s chambers. “Benno,” Ferdinand said, “you may speak as you normally would in these situations.”</p><p>“Understood, High Priest,” Benno said, relaxing slightly.</p><p>Lutz and Mark, too, relaxed a bit, causing Rozemyne’s eyebrows to shoot up in confusion and disbelief. “What’s going on here?” she asked.</p><p>“Didn’t I tell you before?” Lutz asked. “The High Priest worked with us while you were asleep.”</p><p>Benno nodded. “He stood between us and the nobility, making sure they didn’t make demands of us we couldn’t meet.”</p><p>“Yes, I know that,” she said, “but you didn’t say anything about acting, well, normally around him!”</p><p>“I believe this is far from normal,” Ferdinand corrected her, “but as I am not overly familiar with working with commoners and merchants, I followed your advice and have been speaking openly with them.” Though not as openly as he did with Rozemyne in his hidden room.</p><p>She gaped at him as though she’d never seen him before. “<em>The</em> Ferdinand speaking openly with commoners?”</p><p>Benno, Lutz, and Mark chuckled as Fran looked around the room, slightly embarrassed. “Yeah,” Benno said, “he really stuck his neck out for you, you know, though it was something else watching him handle archnobles in negotiations. You could really learn a thing or two from him.”</p><p>She continued to gawp at Ferdinand, which was beginning to annoy him. Did he not promise her to protect those she cared about? Had she not been the one to emphasize over and over how commoners spoke plainly, citing it as one of the reasons she had such difficulty navigating noble society?</p><p>“Wow,” she whispered, her voice full of awe, “you really can do everything, can’t you? How am I supposed to measure up to a fiance like that?”</p><p>“...A what now?!” Benno asked.</p><p>The merchants all stared in shock, their eyes darting between the two of them.</p><p>“Oh, that’s right!” she said, clapping her hands. “We only just announced it before I went to the academy, but Ferdinand and I are engaged. It’s a good thing, too. I think the prince was coming on to me. I wouldn’t have been able to say anything against it if I weren’t already engaged.”</p><p>Well, at least she realized what that fool was doing. Perhaps he wouldn’t have to worry so much about her.</p><p>Benno dropped his head in his hands as Lutz slapped his palm against his head. Mark remained frozen in place. “Did… Did she just say…?” Lutz asked.</p><p>“I don’t know. I don’t want to know. I didn’t hear anything,” Benno said.</p><p>After a long pause, Lutz sighed and said, “Man, nobles sure get engaged early…”</p><p>Ferdinand resisted the urge to rub his temples. “It is not…uncommon for these sorts of arrangements to be made, especially in cases like Rozemyne where the person’s value and mana are exceedingly high. However, neither is it common. Most will find a partner in the Royal Academy by their fifth year. We could not afford to risk losing her to another duchy or the Sovereignty, hence the early engagement.”</p><p>Lifting his head, Benno gave a slow nod. “Yeah, Ehrenfest doesn’t want to lose its monopoly on printing, rinsham, and hairpins before we even open trade to other duchies, and you’re about the only person left who can actually control her rampages.”</p><p>Ferdinand could tell Rozemyne wanted to pout, but she only showed slight annoyance. “If we’re done discussing my personal life, can we move on to business?”</p><p>The merchants all gave her a wry smile as Benno passed over the documents he planned to surrender to the scholars at their meeting before seeing the archduke. After Rozemyne reviewed them, she began going back and forth with them about the terms. Ferdinand chimed in to state whether or not what they proposed was likely to be accepted or how to go about requesting what they wanted to have the highest chance to get it approved. In the end, they had roughly the same terms as before, but this time, it included a section requiring payment for those traveling to instruct local craftsmen in making paper or printing as well as a reduced fee for sending their people to Ehrenfest to be trained instead.</p><p>Of course, Benno had to spend some time reassuring her that having them come to Ehrenfest to train would not prevent Lutz from traveling. On the contrary, he would continue to work with Benno to establish paper and printing guilds across the duchy. Ferdinand temporarily excused himself after that so they could handle the emotional part of canceling the contracts. Once they were ready, he returned so everyone could say their goodbyes, and as Gil led the members of the Plantin Company down the stairs, Ferdinand placed a hand on Rozemyne’s shoulder, offering her the only physical comfort he could. She reached up to place her hand over his but caught herself in time and let her hand fall to her lap.</p><p>He eventually had to leave, but he suggested they spend the night in the temple where she was most comfortable.</p><p>Despite his best efforts, however, he was once again summoned early in the morning. He grabbed a leather bag full of black feystones and marched to the High Bishop’s chambers where he found a pale, sickly-looking Rozemyne. Was this how she had looked in the previous weave? If so, he could understand why Rihyarda had immediately sent for him. By the time he’d arrived, she at least wasn’t so pale, and her face wasn’t glistening with a layer of cold sweat.</p><p>Monica was wiping her forehead when he arrived, but she quickly stepped back as he approached. “Rozemyne? What’s wrong?”</p><p>She shook her head. “It’s… It’s silly. I just… I had a bad dream is all.”</p><p>“Quick, put your hand in here,” he said, holding out the bag of feystones. She did as instructed, and after a moment, she pulled her hand out to see what was inside. Her fingers were covered in gold dust.</p><p><em>No!</em> he wanted to yell. <em>Don’t let it fall on your lap! Keep it all in the bag!</em></p><p>“Are you taking advantage of the situation to get rare materials?” she asked, her face trying to exude offense but only showing despair.</p><p>Ferdinand scoffed. “Hasn’t Elvira told you about the bags of feystones noble women wear on their belts for these occasions?”</p><p>As she nodded, her eyes began to shift colors. He’d summoned the Plantin Company last time, but…</p><p>Well, there was nothing for it, was there? “You’re in danger of losing control of your mana. You’ll only hurt your retainers if we don’t do something about it. Come.” He held out his hand to her and then escorted her to her hidden room. He’d barely closed the door before she had him in her tight embrace.</p><p>“I’m sorry!” she said, her voice quivering. “I just… I just really need someone to hold me. It hurts. It hurts so much! I know everyone says that nothing’s changed, but Lutz won’t even be able to sign the contract!”</p><p>Per her request, he held her, deciding to ignore how wet the front of his robes were getting as she wept into his chest. As he stroked her hair, he wondered what it would have been like to have grown up with so much physical affection that it would drive someone to this level of madness just from being deprived of it for short stints of time. Would she expect the same amount once they were married? If so, would he, too, start going mad without her touch?</p><p>He could not truly comprehend it. This was perhaps the most he had ever touched someone, past weave included. While he’d wanted nothing more than to be physically close with the grown Rozemyne, it had still felt somewhat awkward, like putting on feystone armor for the first time - comfortable, yet unfamiliar.</p><p>This Rozemyne was still a child, and while he supposed he…didn’t mind giving her hugs so much anymore, he certainly didn’t feel the same way about it as he had after she’d rescued him. If he couldn’t hold her again until their starbind, he was certain he would suffer no ill consequences. On the contrary, he would be thankful for the distance once she began to look more like her adult self.</p><p>It was odd how holding her made him envious of how she’d received so much physical affection and love from her family, especially since he was receiving the former himself at that very moment.</p><p>How would things have been different if the woman who was to be his mother upon his baptism lived? Would he have experienced what Rozemyne had with Elvira now?</p><p>As she calmed, her hold on him loosened, and she stepped back, wiping at her face. “Sorry,” she said. “I made a mess of your robes.”</p><p>“It’s no matter,” he said, casting waschen on himself then healing Rozemyne’s eyes. “You seem to be better. Shall we return? I’m certain your retainers are less than pleased with the current situation.”</p><p>She nodded, so he opened the door for her. As she passed him, he recalled what he’d said to her the night their engagement was decided about that hug being the last one until she was older.</p><p><em>I really am a fool,</em> he thought, stepping out of the room to the glares of all present.</p>

<h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
<p>Within a day of Rozemyne’s departure, an invitation to a tea party from Lady Hannelore of Dunkelfelger arrived at the dorm, addressed to the archduke candidates.</p><p>Not Rozemyne.</p><p>That meant I had to go to a tea party full of girls. I held my head and groaned. While Leopold, my head attendant, looked over the invitation again, he tried to comfort me. “Lord Wilfred, you’ve attended tea parties with your sisters and mother before. Simply think of it along those lines.”</p><p>“You don’t get it at all,” I said, rubbing at my eyes with the heels of my hands. “They’re going to want to know about Rozemyne’s trends, not mine! And having tea with Lady Hannalore and her friends is absolutely <em>not</em> the same as having tea with my sisters!”</p><p>Leopold tapped his chin for a moment then smiled as he held up a finger, his green eyes bright with excitement. “Think of it like this - you’re preparing to go into battle.”</p><p>I didn’t follow.</p><p>“With any battle, you must learn the enemy, the terrain, the weapons and tactics they’ll use, what you have at your disposal, and so forth, right?”</p><p>“Yeah.” That was just common sense.</p><p>“Then let’s treat this the same way. Lady Hannelore and her friends are the ones we must study. The terrain is the tea party. They will come at you with questions about sweets, rinsham, and Ehrenfest’s grades. We should prepare our countermeasures!”</p><p>I nodded, finally getting it. “Alright, yeah! Hey, let’s go ask Rozemyne’s retainers for help. Brunhilde is all about this stuff, right? I bet she has some good advice.”</p><p>I went downstairs and found Brunhilde off to one side of the common room, hanging out with some of Rozemyne’s other retainers. “Hi, Brunhilde. Got a moment?”</p><p>She blinked at me and then put on a noble smile. “Why yes, Lord Wilfried. How might I be of assistance?”</p><p>I could tell from the tone of her voice that she really didn’t want to assist me at all, but I didn’t have much of a choice if I was going to come out of this alive. “I received a tea party invitation from Lady Hannelore of Dunkelfelger that I can’t refuse. Rozemyne talks about how amazing you are with this stuff, so I wanted to ask for any information or tips you might have. I don’t want to bring shame to our duchy.”</p><p>Her expression brightened a touch. “Oh, certainly! I’ve actually gathered quite a bit of information on this. However, I’m afraid my lady will be sorely disappointed in me if I were to give away such information for free…”</p><p>I sighed and crossed my arms. “What do you want?”</p><p>Her smile turned calculating. “Let us borrow your guard knights for a gathering excursion. With Angelica and Cornelius gone, we only have Leonore and Judith, and Leonore is busy studying feybeasts for the interduchy tournament.”</p><p>“Huh? That’s it?” I turned around and beckoned Alexis over. “Alexis, would you and the others accompany Rozemyne’s retainers to the gathering spot? They’re low on man power at the moment.”</p><p>Alexis gave Brunhilde a look that I couldn’t quite read, but I was pretty sure he wasn’t happy they weren’t simply paying some knight apprentices to help them. “It’s in exchange for some valuable information,” I explained. “I’ll compensate you for your time later.”</p><p>“Yes, my lord,” he said, crossing his arms. “Simply let me know when our services are required.”</p><p>“I thank you ever so much,” Brunhilde said. “Now then, about Lady Hannelore…”</p><p>To my astonishment, Brunhilde knew <em>a lot</em> about the girls who were coming to the tea party, more than I would ever remember. She also gave me talking points for Rozemyne’s trends and suggested which cookies I should take. Really, I couldn’t overstate the value of her assistance.</p><p>When we finished, I pulled Leopold to the side and whispered, “Let Rozemyne’s retainers borrow my knight apprentices twice, and arrange the payments.”</p><p>“Yes, my lord.”</p><p>When the day of the tea party came, I double checked my attendants had everything and then went to meet the enemy on the field of battle.</p><p>Of course, when I got there and saw the cute, tittering girls sitting around the table, it felt less like a battle and more like an ambush. I was way out of my element here!</p><p>I pasted on my noble smile and reminded myself that Uncle was way scarier. It helped a little.</p><p>My attendants, led by Leopold, handled serving cookies and giving the girls’ attendants samples of rinsham that Brunhilde had picked out. Since I’d been using it myself for a while, my attendants were able to teach theirs how to use it.</p><p>The girls all wanted to smell their samples, and smiles lit their faces at the fragrances. Hannelore, who’d looked apologetic and nervous, actually looked happy.</p><p>“My,” Lady Emiline of Gliessenmeyer said, “this is quite a lovely scent. How ever is it made?”</p><p>I put on an apologetic smile and said, “I am sorry to say that is a trade secret. This is a product that Ehrenfest plans to sell, but I can’t say any more than that. Oh, but there are scents for men as well.”</p><p>She nodded as she looked at my hair. “Yes, I can see you use it as well, Lord Wilfried. I wonder if my father would like it…?”</p><p>“If you would like, I have brought samples for men as well.” As those were distributed, I could picture my little sister’s smirk whenever she won something. <em>Well, it may be her product, but I’m the one giving them out right now, so I deserve a little credit!</em></p><p>The conversation moved on to the cookies I brought, and I explained how they were easy to eat while playing games, what each type of cookie was, and that they, too, would be one of the products discussed at the Archduke Conference.</p><p>“Ehrenfest has some interesting trends this year,” Lady Lorraine of Hauchletzte said.</p><p>“Yes, my little sister is truly blessed by Kunstzeal. She created all of these herself.”</p><p>“That would be Lady Rozemyne, yes?” Hannelore asked.</p><p>“That’s right.”</p><p>The three of them began questioning me then about my sister on everything from how she came up with so much stuff to her relationship with Uncle. It felt weird talking about her like this, but at least it was a topic I knew a bit about, unlike rinsham. There were a lot of trade secrets surrounding it, apparently.</p><p>“Wow, she sure sounds amazing,” Hannelore said, casting her gaze down. “I’m getting a bit nervous at the idea of meeting her…”</p><p>“I wouldn’t worry,” I said. “My sister enjoys talking with girls who’ve been blessed by Efflorelume. She would surely be glad of your invitation.”</p><p>The two girls on either side of me tried to hide their giggles behind their hands while Hannelore’s cheeks turned as pink as her hair. “I-I-I thank you ever so much,” she stammered. “I will be sure to send another invitation once she returns to the academy.”</p><p>I didn’t see why they were acting like what I said was a big deal. It was true. Rozemyne loved cute things and cute children. Since Hannelore was shorter than she was, she’d probably try to adopt her as another little sister or something. Honestly, I was kind of scared for Melchior. Rozemyne would smother him to death with affection if Charlotte was anything to go by.</p><p> </p><p>When I returned to the dormitory, I immediately found Brunhilde and thanked her for all the help. “It was a success because of your assistance. Rozemyne truly has some excellent retainers.”</p><p>Her eyes sparkled as she smiled and said, “You’re quite welcome.”</p><p>I decided to go join in on some of Leonore’s exercises, but first, I needed to debrief with my retainers.</p><p>When we entered the meeting room, tension filled the air as they all looked at each other.</p><p>“What?” I asked. “Did I mess up?”</p><p>“Not…exactly,” Leopold said. “You were just… How shall I say…? Forward. Yes, you were rather forward.”</p><p>“With what?”</p><p>“With…stating your attraction to Lady Hannelore.”</p><p>I reeled back in surprise. “What? No, I was talking about how Rozemyne dotes on cute girls, not anything to do with me!”</p><p>“That is not how it came across to anyone present,” Leopold sighed. “This could be troublesome. You cannot in any way take back those words lest we offend Dunkelfelger the second. Hopefully, they’ll take it as a forward but sweet comment and move on. If not… Well, I doubt they’ll want to marry their daughter into the thirteenth ranked duchy to a man destined to become knight commander, not aub.”</p><p>“Marriage?! Whoa, whoa, whoa!” I shouted. “It was just a harmless comment! I mean, even if I meant it like you said, it’s a bit nuts to go from calling someone cute to talking about marriage!”</p><p>Leopold sighed again. “You’d be surprised how little it takes sometimes… Need I remind you of your great grandmother?”</p><p>“Oh, yeah. Didn’t they get married because Great Grandfather was nice to her once at the interduchy tournament?”</p><p>“Precisely.”</p><p>Suddenly, a cold dread similar to what I felt whenever I heard Bonifatius yell that he was about to step it up settled over me. “I…really need to be careful, don’t I?”</p><p>“Yes, my lord, you really, really do.”</p>

<p>
<em>Lord Ferdinand,</em>
</p><p>
<em>The colorless days continue to drag without our goddess here. While I am busy working to expand her support base, I find myself despondent without her light. If I may ask, when do you plan on allowing her to return?</em>
</p><p>
<em>I ask not only for myself but for other practical reasons as well. The factional splits are slowly starting to reappear with no uniting force to tether them together. It was not so difficult before to get apprentice knights to accompany us to the gathering spot in order to obtain name stone ingredients for Gretia, but now no one wished to help a cross-factional team, even if it’s in support of our goddess. What fickle worshippers!</em>
</p><p>
<em>Brunhilde, ever true to our goddess though unwilling to discuss her divinity, secured assistance from Wilfried’s guard knights with a somewhat clever ploy, though only twice. While it was enough to have Gretia secure what she needed, Roderick has also stated his wish to swear his name and join in serving our goddess. He is relying on Matthias and to a lesser extent, the second-year Laurenz, but they are not enough alone to hunt the feybeasts needed for a high quality stone. There is little chance of convincing Wilfried’s guard knights to assist the boy blamed for the White Tower incident. When might our goddess return to shine her light upon these unworthy simpletons?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Gretia it’s diligent in her devotion and is nearly ready to present her name along with stories she has collected from other duchies at tea parties for attendants. While Roderick is not able to hunt as he needs, he is spending his time completing a task to move our goddess’ heart when he is at last able to swear his name.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Factional politics is not the only reason I wish for our goddess’ swift return. The unrelenting prince is becoming ever more insistent on learning when she is returning so that he might arrange a meeting with her. Lady Eglantine would also like a meeting to introduce her to her allies while Lady Hannelore seeks to have our goddess grace a tea party with her presence. The med- and laynobles are beginning to break under the pressure of the frequent ordonnanzes, and they have begun to fear leaving the dorm without our goddess’ divine protection to shield them from those in the greater heights. When might our goddess be returning?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Less importantly, Lady Detlinde has sent a few requests for Wilfried to join her for a tea party, and she has asked around about him. More importantly, she seeks to besmirch our goddess’ honor by stealing from her the library magic tools that the Goddess of Wisdom personally bestowed upon my lady in recognition of her divinity. It was a pleasure to watch her try to touch one despite knowing the consequences. Her dullness is matched only by the days spent here without my lady.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Might I ask when she is returning?</em>
</p><p>
<em>— Hartmut </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>My lord,</em>
</p><p>
<em>The prince has been becoming more insistent on seeking an audience with Milady. He is ostensibly after a score Milady was forced to provide, though my intelligence suggests he stated his dissatisfaction with the piece. He has even gone to the library on more than one occasion, likely to find Milady. His true motives remain unknown.</em>
</p><p>
<em>As you ordered, I have also been tracking Lady Eglantine as well. She continues to seek materials on the history of the academy to the point the librarian is now searching the closed stacks for her. I’ve seen her take to the skies on her highbeast on multiple occasions now, though I am unable to follow as I don’t know if the shroud of Verbergen extends to highbeasts. I’m not the only one monitoring these trips. I’ve seen some among the prince’s retainers watching her as well.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Here is the other information I’ve been able to gather:</em>
</p><p>
<em>Ladies Emiline and Lorraine are spreading rumors regarding Lord Wilfried’s romantic intentions towards Lady Hannelore.<br/>
Lady Detlinde has made no secret of trying to find out if he is already engaged. She gets angry when the rumors regarding Lady Hannelore are brought up.<br/>
Professor Rauffen is bombarding Professor Hirschur with requests to ditter with Milady.<br/>
The prince has sent retainers to question Professor Solange on what Lady Eglantine is reading and has borrowed a few of the books she’s checked out in the past.<br/>
A medscholar from Drewanchel forced Roderick out of his usual carrel. He is now doing his transcriptions in the reading room.<br/>
More students from various duchies have requested to do crest-certified work for Milady.<br/>
Former Werkestock students are complaining amongst themselves about their mana-poor lands. Some have said it’s been two or three years since they last received filled chalices from the former-third-now-first wife.<br/>
Klassenberg and Drewanchel students continue to speculate which prince Lady Eglantine will choose, though there is now speculation that she will choose neither.<br/>
Professor Fraularm has asked for teaching materials from her predecessor. She was only provided with study guides.</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand read through the rest of the list, most of which gave benign details. Until he got to the final line.</p><p>
<em>Ehrenfest students are gathering legends regarding your time at the academy, apparently at Milady's request.</em>
</p><p>He sighed, letting his head hit the desk as he crumpled the edges of the paper in his hands. Clearly the fool had too much time on her hands. He would need to find a way to keep her occupied at the academy. Perhaps he’d modify his plan from last weave to have Hartmut carefully dole out books from his personal collection to keep her from wasting time on such foolishness.</p><p>Justus sent a separate letter containing information about Delinde’s inquiries into Wilfried’s engagement status so that Ferdinand could surrender it to Sylvester, which he did at his first opportunity, the day before his final meeting with Rozemyne.</p><p>As Sylvester read the letter, his face drained of color. “She’s trying to steal Wilfred now?”</p><p>“So it seems.”</p><p>“No! We can’t let this happen! There’s no way she won’t torture him like she did me! I mean, we look just alike! Is she just trying to hurt me anyway she can?”</p><p>Ferdinand sighed and pulled a bottle of vize and two goblets from Sylvester’s cabinet, pouring both of them a glass and refilling Sylvester’s when he drained it within moments of receiving it. “Yes, I imagine one of her motives is to hurt you, but the only heir they have that is close to coming of age is a rather vapid girl, so they need an archduke candidate to marry into their duchy. Since they cannot force the hands of anyone above them and Rudiger is from a losing duchy, that leaves Wilfried as the easiest target.”</p><p>“Why the hell didn’t I engage him to Rozemyne?!”</p><p>Ferdinand raised a brow at him. “Would you prefer I be forced to marry into Ahrensbach instead?”</p><p>“Hell no! Sorry, I know getting you two engaged was the best option, even if I’ve questioned it a few times since then. I just don’t want to let them have my son. It was enough losing him to my mother. Florencia might actually kill me if we have to surrender him again.</p><p>“If Ahrensbach is making such open inquiries, then it’s safe to assume they’ll bring it up at the Archduke Conference. Do you know how hard it’ll be to fend off Georgine with the sixth-ranked duchy backing her?! Pour me another cup! I can’t do this sober!”</p><p>As Ferdinand filled his brother’s goblet again, he sighed and said, “The best defense is to have him already engaged to someone else. The downside to that is we can’t negotiate to have him marry another archduke candidate, certainly not on such short notice, and anyone below that can be waved away as a second wife, leaving room for that girl to become first.”</p><p>Sylvester narrowed his eyes at him. “You sure do have a lot of hatred for a girl you’ve never met.”</p><p>“Do not forget this is the same girl who openly disrespected my fiancé and tried to touch your son in the middle of class.”</p><p>“Okay, fair point. I don’t like her much myself.” After taking another heavy draw from his glass, he said, “Okay, if I can get him engaged, then I can argue that I can’t have him engaged again so soon as it would cause, I don’t know, problems or something. You can figure out the details.”</p><p>Ferdinand sighed and tapped his temple. It would be the height of rudeness to become engaged to two women at the exact same time, especially if they were of different ranks. Sylvester might be able to beg off on that account if he also played up how it would throw Ehrenfest into chaos given the precarious “peace” between factions at the moment. It wasn’t foolproof, but it was something.</p><p>“The question is, who will you pick as his partner?” Ferdinand asked. “She can’t be from the former Veronica faction. He’s still fighting the prejudice against him from being raised by her. You’ll have a hard time trying to get any Leisegangs to agree, and there aren’t any neutral mednobles who can match the mana of an archduke candidate, especially once he gets Rozemyne’s compression method.”</p><p>“Hell, I don’t know,” Sylvester grumbled, his face flushed with drink. “Maybe… Maybe we can ask that fiancé of yours, huh? She’s smart. She’s really smart. She saved Wilfried from failing his debut and the White Tower thing. Maybe she’ll have a solution here. She can use that… What is it? That other world knowledge or whatever. Think of something we can’t. Or something.”</p><p>Sighing, Ferdinand took the cup from his protesting brother and put the alcohol away. To his annoyance, he found his glass empty and a grinning Sylvester when he returned to his seat. “You’re too far gone to remember anything I have to say now,” he complained, “but yes, we can ask Rozemyne for her thoughts.”</p><p>Sylvester gave him another happy grin. “I knew I could count on you!”</p><p>That only made Ferdinand sigh harder.</p><p> </p><p>The next day, Rozemyne conducted herself as a noble should during the pre meeting with the scholars, and thanks to all the work she and Ferdinand put in beforehand, the negotiations with Sylvester concluded without her calling out anyone for being the fools they were. The plans were finalized, as much as they could be, and the merchants secured favorable terms.</p><p>As they signed the new contract, Ferdinand surreptitiously placed his hand on his knee which he shifted to be close enough to reach out a pinky to Rozemyne. When she felt him touch her hand, her eyes widened a touch, but she made no other outward sign of anything being amiss, even as her pinky curled around his. It was subtle, but the hidden despair in her eyes softened just a touch.</p><p>When the meeting concluded, Sylvester had the room cleared then explained the situation with Wilfried to her.</p><p>“So? What are your thoughts?” he asked.</p><p>She tilted her head in that annoying, adorable way of hers and said, “My first thought is to ask why we’re having this conversation without Wilfried.”</p><p>“It’s expensive to use the teleportation circle,” Ferdinand explained. “Using it as often as we have has drained quite a bit of mana, mana we desperately need for the lower city remodel. We can’t use it so frivolously.”</p><p>Her cheeks colored, likely from remembering just how many times she’d used it so far. “I would hardly call this frivolous. How much mana is it? I’ll give it to you right now. I’m sure Wilfried would gladly donate as well.”</p><p>And to quickly restore that mana, she would have to take an expensive potion. Of course, with her income from all the industries she was involved in, she could easily afford to buy a few, depending on how much crest-certified work she’d given out this term, so saying so would be pointless.</p><p>“I’m going to hold you to that,” Sylvester said, taking out a couple of feystones from his pouch and passing them to her. “Start with filling those up while I write the summons. I’ll have him come tomorrow. Ferdinand, can you take care of the rest?”</p><p>“Certainly.” Once Rozemyne had filled the feystones with her mana, he escorted her to his office where he handed her a sackful. “Get to work,” he commanded. In the meantime, he made plans to visit his estate in order to brew more potions. Rozemyne’s improved health meant she was using far fewer potions, so he’d been slack on making them this weave.</p><p>She got through nearly the whole bag before she became too tired to continue. Ferdinand’s eyebrows shot up when he saw the amount. Just how much mana had those clumps been blocking, and how strong was her mental fortitude to handle compressing to the point she did? He began to worry she would surpass him by the time they married since she would have no reason to slow down during her growing years.</p><p>She had far surpassed Sylvester already, but thankfully, she was nowhere near Ferdinand. Still, he would need to push himself harder to ensure they matched in the future.</p><p>Ferdinand gave her a “kinder” version of his potion and stared at her, considering what he should do with her. While the worst of her emotional breakdown was hopefully behind them, she was still unstable after canceling the contracts a bell ago, and her temple attendants had indirectly told him he’d spent a bit too long in the hidden room with her without a retainer last time.</p><p>That left him in a bit of a bind. Elvira was in the peak of socializing, and while she would absolutely reschedule meetings and tea parties to accommodate Rozemyne, she would be missing out on valuable intel. If her temple attendants felt the need to say something, then Rihyarda most certainly would, and he did not want to face her wrath. However, he was unwilling to push her away before she’d had her fill since that would still leave her susceptible to an emotional breakdown. That meant prolonged time in a hidden room alone because he sure as hell wasn’t going to bring Damuel in there with them, no matter how many times he’d watched her hug Lutz.</p><p>Well, there was one thing he could offer her to lift her spirits. “Rozemyne, I must return to my estate this afternoon to attend to some matters. Would you like to come visit my library?”</p><p>The answer was a foregone conclusion.</p><p> </p><p>The next morning, he summoned her to his estate again, asking Rihyarda to bring her harspiel. Wilfried wasn’t due to return until after lunch, and they had very little time to arrange a new composition for that brat of a prince. Still, he didn’t see any need to waste the morning when he could observe her practicing while he worked on the song.</p><p>As she sat next to him, nervously positioning her harspiel, he noticed she’d nearly outgrown it. He would have to procure her a new one soon. He would have had Lasfam bring her one of his spares, but she hadn’t grown enough to use a full adult-sized one yet.</p><p>“So what was it the prince disliked about the first piece?” Ferdinand asked. “The arranged version your musician sent was quite beautiful.”</p><p>“As far as I could tell, he didn’t like it because Lady Eglantine did.” Under her breath, she muttered, “He’s such a [%#*$@&amp;], getting jealous over a little girl.”</p><p>His eyes widened slightly as he suddenly came to a realization. “Rozemyne, do you still see yourself as the small child who went into the jureve?”</p><p>She stared at him for a moment then gasped in shock. “You’re right! When I picture myself in my head, I’m still small.”</p><p>“Rozemyne, you’re no longer a little girl. From the time you entered the academy until the day you tie your hair up, you will be treated as a young woman, and you’ll need to act accordingly.”</p><p>She nodded. “Mother has said something similar, but I didn’t realize until now I wasn’t truly taking her words to heart…” In a daze, she gazed at her hands as though seeing them for the first time. Perhaps in a way, she was.</p><p>Regrettably, they didn’t have time for her to come to terms with her revelation. “Rozemyne, save it for later. Right now, we need to work on the prince’s song. Do you have a melody we can use?”</p><p>She looked a bit hurt, yet she tilted her head and closed her eyes as she thought. “Hmmm… How about…” Unlike her normal humming, she began to sing the song in the language of her past life, though quietly as though trying to remember how it went.</p><p>Her body wasn’t the only thing that has changed. It struck him just how different her singing voice was now. She must have practiced for many, many hours to learn how to sing again.</p><p>Partway through the song, her eyes snapped open, and she shook her head. “Nope, he can’t have that one. That one’s mine.” Her gaze flicked to him and then away again as her cheeks took on a light blush.</p><p><em>Oh, a song you want to keep for me, is it?</em> he thought, keeping his face neutral so as not to betray the warmth blossoming in his chest.</p><p>“We’ll arrange it at another time,” he said. “Anything else?”</p><p>She looked up at the ceiling, furrowing her brow in thought. “I don’t want to give him anything about pure or true love since he forgot all about Lady Eglantine for a moment when he saw my blessing. Hmm… Oh, how about this?”</p><p>She hummed the song, and Ferdinand quickly marked down notations, cutting her off when she started repeating the melody with a new verse. When he finished, he started plucking out the notes on his harspiel, making slight changes and nodding when he was satisfied he had the basic melody down. “What’s it about?”</p><p>“It’s about how two people find each other under the same night sky, looking at the same stars, how they’re connected through magic—“</p><p>“ROZEMYNE!” Ferdinand barked, his ears burning.</p><p>“What?!” she shrieked in response. After a moment, her face flushed red as she waved her hands in front of her. “No, not like that! That’s not what I meant! It’s more of a, uh, metaphorical magic. Something like the blessings of the gods, I guess, or maybe Dregarnuhr crossing their threads.”</p><p>Good gods, her old world was beyond shameless! No wonder she had written such a crass story when she was younger. It was likely tame by their standards.</p><p>At least it seemed Elvira had found some time to cover the basics of Beischmacht‘s domain. Hopefully, she wouldn’t make any blunders like the last weave. He still wanted to cringe when he remembered what she told Hirschur she wanted to put in her practice proposal stone.</p><p>He wanted to cringe even harder when he thought that he had, in fact, already dyed her in his colors.</p><p>Turning his attention back to the song, he muttered, “So it’s about the God of Darkness meeting with the Goddess of Light and giving their blessings to a couple.” He wrote out lyrics, occasionally listening to Rozemyne’s suggestions, and then got to work arranging the piece. “Take this time to practice, Rozemyne.”</p><p>“Oh, then I’ll practice in the lib—“</p><p>“You’ll practice where you are.”</p><p>She paled. “Oh, I wouldn’t want to disturb you while you’re writing a song for royalty. Ohohoho~”</p><p>“You won’t disturb me.”</p><p>“Surely this requires your full attention. I don’t want to distract you.”</p><p>“I’m more than capable of observing your practice and arranging a song at the same time.”</p><p>They glared at each other through their smiles before Rozemyne relented…by singing as loudly as she could while playing her harspiel.</p><p>Little did she know, he’d already decided how he’d arrange the piece since, like her, he only wanted to put in minimal effort, and he enjoyed listening to her sing.</p><p>She could only maintain that volume through half a song, soon giving up and practicing as she normally would. It was a shame she didn’t enjoy it more; she could’ve been an extraordinary musician. Her lack of enthusiasm, however, would keep her from pushing the boundaries of excellence.</p><p>When he finished arranging the piece, he strummed it on his harspiel and nodded. As he played through it a second time while singing, Rozemyne’s fingers stopped moving and her voice quieted as she watched him.</p><p>“Wow,” she said when he finished, “even your mediocre effort is amazing. It’s no wonder so many women fainted when you played a song you put your all into.”</p><p>“You’ve stopped playing.”</p><p>As she shot him a glare, he turned away to rewrite the song on a clean sheet of paper, ignoring the heat at the tips of his ears.</p><p> </p><p>They ate lunch at his estate and then returned to the castle, arriving just after Wilfried. When Sylvester cleared the room, the boy’s eyes lit with excitement. “Finally!” he said. “I get to be in one of these meetings!”</p><p>Rozemyne shook her head. “They’re not as fun as you seem to think.”</p><p>“You just say that because you don’t get left out all the time. It’s not fair how you get to spend more time with Father than I do.”</p><p>Sylvester winced as Rozemyne’s face softened with melancholic sympathy. That expression sent an arrow straight through Ferdinand’s chest.</p><p>
<em>I’m sorry, Rozemyne. Soon, I will reunite you with your family. I promise you.</em>
</p><p>“Well, Wilfried, Rozemyne’s right. This one won’t be fun.”</p><p>His eyes widened. “Did I do something? Wait, this isn’t about Lady Hannelore, is it?”</p><p>“What about Lady Hannelore?” all three of them snapped.</p><p>He winced and backed away as far as his chair would allow him. “Nothing! Absolutely nothing! Just, uh, just that Rozemyne wasn’t there when her tea party invitation came, so I had to go. I was the only guy there.”</p><p>Rozemyne pursed her lips. “I wanted to meet Lady Hannelore…”</p><p>Meanwhile, Sylvester was trying - and failing - to hide his laughter behind his sleeve, which seemed to embarrass Wilfried even more.</p><p>“Enough with this foolishness,” Ferdinand said, cutting through the amicable atmosphere. “We have serious matters to discuss involving you.”</p><p>The boy straightened up and flicked his eyes between his uncle and father, bracing himself.</p><p>“Are you aware Lady Detlinde is asking around about your engagement?”</p><p>“What?!” he yelled, jumping up his feet. “No! No! Anyone but her! Please, Father, don’t make me marry her!”</p><p>“Calm yourself,” Ferdinand said as Sylvester passed him a feystone. “That is exactly what we’re trying to avoid. As your cousin is set to be relay aub, she will need to marry an archduke candidate.”</p><p>“Then she can have Rudiger. He seemed excited to go to her tea party.”</p><p>Sylvester shook his head. “He’s from a losing duchy.”</p><p>Wilfried put his head in his hands and grumbled, “That sounds like their problem, not mine.”</p><p>Sighing heavily, Ferdinand explained the political realities of the situation, watching as the boy’s shoulders slumped lower and lower.</p><p>“Alright, now that you two know the situation, let’s talk solutions,” Sylvester said, clapping his hands and leaning forward. “Rozemyne, what do you have for me?”</p><p>Wilfried looked at her with such hope that even Ferdinand felt bad for the boy.</p><p>Rozemyne tilted her head and closed her eyes, deep in thought. “This is a tough one… It’s true we really don’t have the time or leverage yet to get him a bride from a duchy higher than Ahrensbach.”</p><p>Wilfried held out his hands toward her, his face full of desperation. “Please, Rozemyne, you gotta think of something!”</p><p>“I’m trying,” she sighed. “It’s just so hard trying to think of someone who’s parents won’t get mad.”</p><p>“Can’t you just become aub and let me be your second husband?”</p><p>Rozemyne spluttered as Sylvester started laughing while trying to say there was no way she was becoming aub.</p><p>When Wilfried looked up, his face paled. “Whoa! Uncle! I-I wasn’t being serious!”</p><p>When everyone turned to look at him, they shivered as though they’d opened the windows to the winter winds.</p><p>…Perhaps he’d let his murderous thoughts show.</p><p>“U-umm… Anyway, I might have an idea,” Rozemyne said, taking the attention from Ferdinand. As she spoke, she casually brought a hand up to tuck her hair behind her ear and brushed the feystones on the hair stick he’d made her. Surprisingly, that simple gesture cooled his wrath considerably.</p><p>“Well, let’s hear it!”</p><p>As Rozemyne laid out her plan, Wilfried looked conflicted but hopeful while a grin crept across Sylvester’s face.</p><p>It wasn’t a <em>bad</em> plan given the circumstances, and it would at least buy them a little time.</p><p>So long as they could get the right people to agree to it.</p>

<p>I had mixed feelings about Rozemyne’s plan. It wasn’t that I didn’t think it would work - it absolutely could if we did things right - but I barely knew the people involved. They had my respect, sure, but that was a far cry from wanting to marry one of them.</p><p>Before we went back to the dorms, I found out Rozemyne had committed me to filling a few feystones to pay for my trip here. Apparently, she’d filled way, way more, so I couldn’t be mad at her, but it was a little annoying having my little sister make promises for me. She was a good kid, but she could lose sight of everyone else when she went on a rampage. At least this one was for my sake, I guess.</p><p>When we arrived, Rozemyne said, “I’ll get my retainers to set up a meeting room and gather the relevant people. You get your retainers in order. Remember, we don’t want this to spread yet, so only bring your head attendant and one guard knight. Hartmut will be the only scholar we need.”</p><p>“Right.” As she hurried off to make preparations, I pulled out the handkerchief Charlotte had made for me and wiped my sweaty hands. Had Uncle or Rozemyne felt this nervous when they were talking about getting engaged?</p><p>Nah, not those two. Rozemyne probably took one look at his library and then barreled into Father’s office to demand his hand in marriage. Uncle probably just let it happen because he was old and needed to marry <em>somebody.</em> Not like anyone else could put up with his personality.</p><p>I went into the common room and got Leopold to go help Rozemyne’s attendants set up the room, then I summoned Alexis and asked how the gathering trips had gone while we waited.</p><p>“Um, well, my lord. It seems they got what they needed.”</p><p>I narrowed my eyes at him, but when he didn’t elaborate further, I passed him a sound-blocking tool and ordered him to spit it out.</p><p>He scratched the back of his head and threw a nervous glance around the room before muttering, “It wasn’t really for Rozemyne’s retainers, though a couple of them came along. They were taking Gretia out.”</p><p>“Yeah, she’s been going with Hartmut and Rozemyne’s guard knights for a while now,” I said. He looked surprised, but it was my job as future Knight Commander to know what was going on at all times. How could I protect my people if I didn’t know where they were? Honestly, it kind of bothered me that Alexis hadn’t noticed. I’d need to talk to Bonifatius about awareness training.</p><p>“And you’re okay with this?” he asked.</p><p>I shrugged. “Doesn’t really matter if I am or not. Rozemyne’s going to do what Rozemyne’s going to do. It’s safest to just step out of the way so you don’t get trampled while you wait for Uncle to grab her leash.” Of course, that meant she had basically no oversight at the Royal Academy, save for my occasional threats to write a letter to Uncle. If she wasn’t hurting anything, though, I wasn’t going to try to control her rampage. That work was better left to professionals.</p><p>“Besides,” I said, “I like Rozemyne’s idea of turning all the kids into one faction to support Charlotte. I don’t want my little sister to be like Father. He basically destroyed his support base as I understand it, so he’s having a hard time. If Rozemyne’s tactics can prevent that from happening to Charlotte, then I’m all for it. Even if it means…helping those kids.”</p><p>I glanced over to Roderick and the others who’d led me to the White Tower that day. Rozemyne and I had talked a lot about it after she woke up, and she helped me see that they weren’t really doing anything I hadn’t done with my grandmother. I mean, I had called Uncle a bastard in my head all the time because that’s what she’d called him, but he was actually pretty great, if you ignored his personality, and all the knights respected him. When he retired, I wanted to be a Knight Commander that would be looked up to like that.</p><p>Rozemyne, Charlotte, and even Mother talked me through sorting out all the stuff Grandmother said and figuring out what was true, what wasn’t, and what needed more context. For instance, it was true that she loved me, but it wasn’t true that I was better than my siblings. In fact, Charlotte had really shown me up at her debut. I also learned that while Grandmother showered me with gifts, she’d given nothing to my siblings. Learning that put my whole dynamic with her in a different light.</p><p>In a way, it embarrassed me to still be learning the same lesson Father, Mother, Uncle, and Rozemyne taught me after the White Tower incident - that there were many truths, and I needed to listen to all of them.</p><p>While I still couldn’t bring myself to go talk to the kids who’d tricked me, I did understand that they had their truths as well. Maybe with more training, I’d be ready to listen to them some day soon.</p><p>Leopold pulled me out of my thoughts and directed me to the meeting room where Rozemyne and some of her retainers were already waiting. Leiseleta was serving tea and pound cake, so Leopold topped mine with rumtopf like I preferred. Hartmut was sitting on Rozemyne’s right, paper and ink in hand, while Brunhilde was sitting to her left, her face a mask of nobility. Rihyarda stood behind her, also betraying nothing, though I was certain Rozemyne had given her at least a brief overview of the plan. Cornelius seemed slightly annoyed, but he always looked like that.</p><p>Once everything was served and Leiseletta stepped back, Rozemyne turned on the area sound-blocking tool. “Thank you all for meeting on such short notice,” she said, giving everyone a peaceful smile. “I apologize for the abruptness of this meeting, but it is a bit of an emergency. Wilfried?”</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I looked all the people in the sound-blocking barrier in the eye and said, “As you probably already know, Lady Detlinde is asking around about me. We’re certain Father will get pressured by Ahrensbach at the Archduke Conference to get the two of us engaged.”</p><p>Nobody looked surprised, but Rihyarda did let some worry show. I could feel Leopold and Alexis’ support as they stood behind me.</p><p>“We need a way to prevent that,” I continued, “so Rozemyne and I have come with a proposal – Ah, bad choice of word. A, uh, an…offer? We’ve come with an offer after talking things over with Aub Ehrenfest.”</p><p>Rozemyne took a deep breath and turned to Brunhilde. “How would you feel about marrying my brother?”</p><p>Hartmut’s eyes widened slightly, but Brunhilde’s nearly fell out of her head as she brought a hand to her mouth. “M-me, my lady?” she squeaked.</p><p>…It was kind of cute.</p><p>Rozemyne nodded. “He’s a good person, straight forward, true, always tries his best, and–”</p><p>“Rozemyne,” I cut her off, covering my eyes with my hand, “stop.”</p><p>“And humble!” she added.</p><p>It was times like this when I really understood why Uncle pinched her cheeks so much.</p><p>When I finally looked up, Brunhilde was giving me that same calculating stare she had when we bargained for information. “Yes,” I sighed, “I know your lady would not like you to give away anything for free. Don’t worry. I’ve come prepared.”</p><p>She raised her eyebrows. “Did you now? I am so curious to hear how you plan to not only woo me but convince my father to let his daughter marry someone raised by Lady Veronica.”</p><p>You know, no matter how many times I heard it, it still stung to hear people speak with such disdain about my childhood. Regardless of anything else she’d done, my grandmother had given me a lot of love and praise. I had so many happy memories with her, and even though I knew what she’d done, I still cared about her. Sometimes, it hurt knowing I’d never see her again, that my last memories of her would be of her insulting my uncle and sister and telling me all sorts of lies about them.</p><p>To think I’d given up my reputation for that…</p><p>I came back to the present and mentally went through everything Rozemyne tried to drill into my head. “First,” I said, “I would like to confirm your situation. You’re currently the heir to Geibe Groschel, correct?”</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. “Yes. Currently.”</p><p>“His second wife is still young, right? What happens if she has a son?”</p><p>Her silence was all the answer I needed. This was one of the weak points Rozemyne told me to exploit. “Now, what happens if you marry the son of the archduke, set to become Knight Commander shortly after he comes of age? How does that affect your standing versus a possible younger brother?”</p><p>Brunhilde’s eyes twinkled as she leaned back in her chair, crossing her arms. “Well, even with your…reputation, I suppose it would be at least as good as when Lady Gabriele married into Ehrenfest.”</p><p>There it was, the generational sin. If you were to listen to half the people in the duchy, all bad things could be traced straight back to my great grandmother. “Would it not be an insult to give the seat to someone else when you’re married to the archduke’s son?”</p><p>“Indeed it would,” she agreed, finally giving me a small smile. “However, this would mean living in Groschel. The Knight Commander must remain in Ehrenfest.”</p><p>I nodded. “Yeah, but after doing so many Spring Prayers and Harvest Festivals, I can say it doesn’t take long at all to go between Groschel and Ehrenfest on highbeast, and I’ll be able to travel even faster by then since I’ll have Rozemyne’s compression method. And… well, I mean… If it came down to it, I could stay in Ehrenfest most of the time. We’d hardly be the only married couple living apart for half the year or more.”</p><p>“Hmm… While that’s true, I don’t relish the idea of having to do all the geibe work by myself.”</p><p>“Well,” I said, resisting the urge to scratch my head as I thought through what Rozemyne had said about this, “there are really only a few times a year where I will <em>have</em> to be in Ehrenfest all the time, and you’d be there for one of them already with winter socializing. If I work hard, I’m sure I could get my high beast to move fast enough to make it work for us.”</p><p>For some reason, that made her blush a little bit. I looked at Leopold through the corner of my eye, silently asking, <em>I didn’t just pull a Hannelore again, did I?</em> Of course, he couldn’t respond, so I just turned my attention back to Brunhilde, hoping I hadn’t messed up somehow.</p><p>“Well, while this sounds like quite the deal for me,” she said, making my heart skip a beat as I realized I’d just cleared the first obstacle, “none of this will convince my father. He is quite bitter about the treatment we received from your grandmother.”</p><p>Yeah, that wasn’t going away anytime soon, was it? I had the feeling that no matter what I did, I’d always be Lady Veronica’s grandson to the man who might be my future father-in-law.</p><p>Man, just what was I signing myself up for? I was beginning to feel like I got tricked.</p><p>Rozemyne stepped in at this point since she was more familiar with what she was propos– offering.</p><p>“Brunhilde, as you know, there are many, many geibes who want to establish papermaking and printing workshops in their lands. I can move Groschel to the top of the list. My Gutenbergs would be ready to start training your craftsmen as early as this spring. However, I would like to add the caveat that they’ll also be dealing with merchants from other duchies in the summer, so it may be a bit slower to get everything set up than it was in Ilgner or Haldenzel.”</p><p>By the size of Brunhilde’s eyes and the height of Hartmut’s eyebrows, that was a pretty good offer.</p><p>“That… That will certainly go a long way to convincing him, but…” She trailed off and looked away with regret. “I’m afraid my father would say he’d rather wait than let me marry Wilfried.”</p><p>Let! She said let! That was a good sign, right? We were almost there!</p><p><em>Come on, Rozemyne!</em> I silently cheered. <em>Time to strike the finishing blow!</em></p><p>She sighed and brought a hand to her cheek. “That’s rather unfortunate. You’re aware that Ehrenfest will only be able to host a very small number of duchies this summer, yes?”</p><p>“Yes, I am,” Brunhilde agreed, her face blank. She was probably trying to figure out where Rozemyne was going with this, but no one could ever predict what my little sister was thinking.</p><p>“Well, my hope was to be able to expand the number of duchies we could host as soon as possible, and with Groschel as the closest city to Ehrenfest, Wilfried and I had already negotiated with Aub Ehrenfest to rebuild your downtown to be able to accommodate the overflow. However, it seems your father would not be interested since he’d rather…wait than allow you to marry a fine man like my big brother.”</p><p>While Brunhilde gaped at her, Hartmut looked enraptured as he held his hands up and said, “Our lady’s generosity knows no bounds. Truly, never have mine eyes seen such benevolence so freely given! To think she would bestow it upon someone so undeserving that he would have spurned my lady’s mercy so easily!”</p><p>Brunhilde clicked her tongue and said, “And I suppose if she had suddenly asked you to marry Wilfried, you would have fallen over yourself to accept?”</p><p>“But of course!” he said without hesitation, making me feel…very weird, and not in a good way. “I shall do as my lady wills!”</p><p>Rozemyne sighed and closed her eyes as she muttered a prayer to Verdraeos. I found myself muttering along with her. Was this what she had to put up with all the time? He was just as crazy as Rozemyne, though he seemed to worship her instead of books. Well, at least he wouldn’t try to rub his face on her like she did books sometimes.</p><p>…Would he?</p><p>Seeing his display, I wasn’t so sure. I’d need to keep an eye on him.</p><p>“Hartmut, contain yourself,” Rozemyne said, and he instantly sat down and started behaving himself.</p><p>Once things had calmed back down, I looked Brunhilde in the eye - no matter how much it scared me - and said, “Brunhilde, I won’t ask for an answer right now, but–”</p><p>“I’ll write to my father right away,” she said, practically leaping to her feet. “My lady, may I be excused?”</p><p>Rozemyne beamed at her as she dismissed her, and I watched her rush from the room like her dress was on fire.</p><p>After a moment of silence, I said, “So, uh… That means she accepted, right?”</p><p>Leopold sighed. “Yes, my lord. She is now seeking the approval of her father. The fact that you came to him through her should significantly help your case. You not only won her to your side, but you avoided getting Aub Ehrenfest involved, meaning he has the right to refuse, though I doubt he will with such…generous concessions.”</p><p>We were preparing to perform entwickeln in the lower city, so I understood a bit of how much it would take to do the same in Groschel. Rozemyne had sworn she would give as much mana as she safely could to ensure both entwickelns went off without a hitch. It really made me glad knowing I had such a strong, caring little sister on my side and to see how much she was willing to give to make sure I didn’t have to marry that creepy girl.</p><p>Of course, I couldn’t let her do all the work! Now that I was done with practical lessons, and the Dedication Ritual was complete, I could devote all the mana I could spare to the empty feystones Father was sending over.</p><p>It was really too bad that I really didn’t have that much left over after enduring Leonore’s training. She was almost worse than Bonifatius. I’d give it a couple more years before the knights would be begging to train with him instead.</p><p>“Yes!” Rozemyne said. “Leisegang GET! With that, we’ve now officially secured their support while also protecting Charlotte’s chance to become the next aub.”</p><p>Hartmut interjected, “My lady, don’t forget that you still have the old man to worry about.”</p><p>While she didn’t say anything, the look she gave me practically yelled, <em>Eh, he can’t live that much longer anyway, so not really my problem.</em> I wasn’t the smartest when it came to navigating politics, but even I knew his death wouldn’t change much in that regard, though to be honest, I hoped he’d take at least some of the hate with him when he climbed the towering staircase.</p><p>Rihyarda stepped forward and said, "Yes, while you may have secured the support of the Leisegang faction, you can't be dismissive of the dangers hidden under Verbergen's shroud."</p><p>“So Wilfried,” Rozemyne asked, changing the subject, “how’s it feel to be engaged?" I guess she really, really didn't want to keep talking politics, not that I would complain. It was kind of over my head, anyway.</p><p>“I’m not engaged yet,” I scoffed. “And it feels weird.”</p><p>She nodded, her gaze somewhere far away. “Yeah, it does feel weird getting engaged at ten, doesn’t it?”</p><p>It had to be way worse for her. At least Brunhilde was only a little older than me, and I doubted she would ever be like Uncle was with Rozemyne. At least, I hoped not. I couldn’t see her making such a huge courtship neck—</p><p>“Oh, crap!” I said, grabbing my head. “If her father approves, I’m going to have to make her courtship jewelry! I don’t know how to do that! We haven’t even started brewing yet! Oh, man, what colors does she have?! What do I even make it out of?!”</p><p>Leopold put a hand on my shoulder as Rozemyne, Cornelius, and Alexis all tried to hold back their laughter, the jerks. “My lord, as I’ve said many times before, you cannot consider Lord Ferdinand to be the standard in any regard. Almost no one gives courtship jewelry so early. Might I suggest waiting a few years?”</p><p>“Wait,” Rozemyne cut in, “what do you mean about Ferdinand not being the standard? He’s practically the perfect noble, right?”</p><p>Leopold turned his face away.</p><p>“Right?” she asked Hartmut.</p><p>“Whatever my lady says.”</p><p>Cornelius laughed and placed a hand on her head. “Give it up, Rozemyne. He’s just as weird as you. You’re perfect for each other.”</p><p>As they started bickering, I nodded to Rozemyne’s retainers and left the room, Leopold and Alexis following behind. “That’s one battle down,” I said. “Time to fight the next.” With that, I went to join Leonore’s training.</p>

<p>As expected, Giebe Groschel sought an audience with Sylvester. What wasn’t expected was that he sought it the very next day. Ferdinand had thought it would take longer to convince Brunhilde, but since when had anything gone as he expected with Rozemyne?</p><p>He didn’t sit in on the meeting, but Sylvester had gone over the results with him. Giebe Groschel had agreed to the engagement with a few concessions on his part to offset the cost of everything he was receiving. Brunhilde would be registered as a supplier since she would be marrying into the aub’s family even though she would maintain her right to succession as Giebe Groschel. As they needed all the suppliers they could get, they couldn’t afford to lose Wilfried or not take advantage of Brunhilde.</p><p>There were various other concessions made, but the one the giebe had the most difficulty agreeing to was to not hold Wilfried’s past against him - not his history with Veronica nor the White Tower incident - and to treat him as he would any other archduke candidate. He relented soon enough, but without the magic contract, Ferdinand was certain the man would have immediately gone back on his word.</p><p>Overall, he had to commend Rozemyne for her quick thinking. They weren’t actually giving Groschel anything after all was said and done. As in the last weave, her industries would have been brought there soon enough given Brunhilde was her attendant, and they would have had to reform their lower city regardless to accommodate the influx of traders. All they had done was push the time table up a bit, and with provinces sending their craftsmen to Ehrenfest rather than the other way around, they could still train those from Haldenzel and Groschel in the spring as promised.</p><p>In essence, they gained the Liesegang’s support for free while forcing them to disregard Wilfried’s most glaring faults and provide a supplier for the foundation. He’d need to praise her when he saw her at the interduchy tournament.</p><p>Once the giebe and aub finished, Ferdinand sent a letter to the Plantin Company giving them the necessary details about Groschel along with another order for feyplant paper, which was delivered promptly. He spent the rest of the day in his workshop experimenting with it.</p><p>A couple of days after that, Justus’ report came in.</p><p>
<em>My lord,</em>
</p><p>
<em>The prince summoned Milady today. Once again, he had the room cleared save for his sole attendant and spoke to her rather harshly.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Prince: You said to propose to Eglantine with her heart’s desire, yet she still refuses to give an answer.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Milady: My sincerest apologies that my personal experience was not helpful to you.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Prince: Do you know how long I spent reading the books she borrowed from the library to figure out what it was she wanted? They were all history books about the academy! When I told her she could read such material in the Royal Library, she gave me a noncommittal answer, and I had to leave shortly after.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I was rather proud of Milady. Despite his talk of books and the Royal Library, she only fidgeted slightly.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Milady: I am saddened to hear that Lady Eglantine’s heart’s desire still hides under the shroud of Verbergen.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Prince: I’ll need something else. Do you have the song?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Milady: I have brought it, but as my retainers are not present, I am unable to present it to you now. Once you have the chance to review it, I do hope it meets your expectations.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Prince: You may summon one of them to bring it, but then send them back outside.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Once he got his hands on the song, he flipped through it then demanded she sing it for him.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Milady: Oh, dear. I’m afraid Kunstzeal will not offer her blessings for one so unprepared as I.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Prince: You wrote it. You can sing it.</em>
</p><p>
<em>With no other choice, she sang, and once again, he was enamored. It was a lovely song, though not one of your best - by design, I’m assuming.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Prince: Yes, that song will do nicely. Do you not have the other?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Milady: My apologies, but as you expressed your disfavor of it when I presented it, I did not prepare it as I did not want to offend you by showing you a piece so below expectations.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Prince: Sing that one for me, too. I wish to hear how below expectations it truly is. I trust you remember it well enough since you wrote it.</em>
</p><p>
<em>The prince seemed even more enchanted as she sang for the second time. He reacted much like the princess did to your performances, and it took him several moments to recover once she was finished.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Prince: Hm. It’s acceptable. Send it to me as soon as possible. I might request more songs from you in the future.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Milady: I am honored that you would deign to accept the humble offerings I am able to provide. However, I do fear that I will fall short of your expectations as music is not my forte.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Prince: Not your…? What would you consider your truest strength, then?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Milady: Were I to give an honest answer, I would say my love of reading and libraries.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Prince: And you would place that above your ability to write music on command, give beautiful blessings, win a ditter against Dunkelfelger as a first year with limited manpower and resources, invent and disseminate new trends, and devise new recipes with rare ingredients likely not widely used in your duchy?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Milady: I am humbled by your praise as it offers me far more credit than I deserve. If I might be excused for putting back Verbergen’s veil… While I may be able to produce a melody, my talented musician and remarkable fiancé arrange the pieces. I am the High Bishop, so I give many blessings throughout the year, as is expected of my station. My ditter victory can largely be credited to surprise, and I would not expect such tactics to work a second time. While I might have provided the original ideas behind some of Ehrenfest’s industries and recipes, it is my craftsmen and chefs who bring them to life. As you can see, I am quite undeserving of your praise as most of the credit belongs to others.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Prince: I see… Incidentally, did you know the Royal Library is the largest in the country?</em>
</p><p>How many attempts did that make now?! Had her poor social skills and young appearance in the last weave been all that was holding the prince back from trying to take her as a second wife? What of his devotion to Eglantine? Ferdinand knew Rozemyne’s worth far outstripped the hidden princess’, but for that foolish boy to continually go after <em>his</em> fiancé…</p><p>He was going to have to take over the whole damned country just to chase that insect away from his Rozemyne.</p><p>
<em>Again, I must commend Milady’s efforts. She managed to restrain herself admirably.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Milady: I do recall hearing such at one time, yes.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Prince: Hmph. Rozemyne, do you know why Eglantine has been taking flights around the grounds lately?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Milady: My apologies, but a woman’s intentions are often hidden under the shroud of Verbergen.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Prince: Did you not lead her out into the snow yourself?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Milady: As I stated before, we went to offer prayers at the shrine. Perhaps she is a devout person who wishes to offer many prayers to the gods.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Prince: Unlikely. You’ll be invited to another tea party with her. Try to find out her heart’s desire.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Milady: I will endeavor to meet your expectations, but this is a topic rarely brought up so soon after meeting.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Prince: I trust you’ll find a way.</em>
</p><p>
<em>He then dismissed her.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Eglantine has discovered something interesting in the library. Professor Solange mentioned there was another collection of materials in an underground archive that was only accessible to archduke candidates and royalty, though entry is impossible without three archnoble librarians. I believe she intends to start making inquiries. She also has invited Milady to a tea party with other female archduke candidates she counts as allies.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Gretia has completed her name stone. With Milady and Lord Wilfried back, things in the dormitory have returned to their previous state, meaning Roderick is now able to gather his ingredients. While observing, I noticed Matthias and Laurenz surreptitiously gathering ingredients of their own. It seems your mission for Hartmut is proceeding as planned, though Muriella has yet to make a move. She seems too enamored with Lady Elvira’s books to listen to a word Hartmut says.</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand tapped his temple as a half-formed idea came to him. When next he met with Elvira, he’d offhandedly mention a fictitious story about some scholar or the other making a name stone to swear herself to her lady since the man she loved had already done so himself. While he could not make Muriella take a romantic interest in any of Rozemyne’s name sworn, he could at least put the idea in her head.</p><p>Justus’ letter continued with the usual pieces of intel he gathered in the course of his investigations. As usual, most were of no immediate use, but he kept them in the back of his mind in case they ever were in the ever-changing future.</p><p>Three days later, Justus sent another headache-inducing report. Rozemyne and Hannelore finally had their threads crossed by Dregarnuhr at a private tea party. Of course, Rozemyne offered her a sample of rinsham, and they had a light-hearted conversation.</p><p>Until Hannelore mentioned seeing her in the library.</p><p>Rozemyne immediately assumed her visits meant the girl enjoyed reading, never thinking she’d gone there in search of her. Rozemyne offered to let her borrow one of Elvira’s novels, but when Hannelore said she would bring one for her from Dunkelfelger in return, she couldn’t contain her excitement any longer and cast a ridiculously large blessing.</p><p>Justus was beside himself, wanting desperately to hold her back, but he was unable to intervene as he was under the shroud of Verbergen.</p><p>Hannelore was shocked to say the least, as were her retainers. Rozemyne’s were stunned as well, though they recovered quicker since Hartmut wasn’t among them, and they’d seen her blessings before. Rozemyne was deeply apologetic, but Hannelore gave many assurances that no offense was taken. Rather, she seemed awed by the sight.</p><p>After her lack of reaction to the Royal Library, Ferdinand had convinced himself that they were beyond such blunders. Only in hindsight did he realize what a fool he’d been. Rozemyne had been so excited to make her first bookworm friend in the first weave that she’d passed out and remained unconscious long enough that Rihyarda had forced him to come do a check up on her.</p><p>Perhaps he should have spoken more about books with her, but he simply didn’t have the time to read anything not related to research, which she took little interest in. While she would happily read anything handed to her, she wouldn’t want to discuss the details, findings, or future research possibilities.</p><p>He idly wondered what boon the girl would get from Rozemyne’s blessing. Damuel had received an extended mana growth period, her parents had been healed, her sister had been accepted to the Gilberta Company and had no equal in making hair sticks, Benno’s business was thriving, and Lutz had achieved his dream of making Rozemyne’s products and traveling to other cities. Her blessings from Angriff, Flutrane, and Heilschmerz all produced visible results. Even her blessing in the library had revived the shumil magic tools.</p><p>Sitting back, he wondered why he never seemed to have gained anything from her blessings, even the one that had had such an impact on her family, friends, and supporters or the one she’d given him before he left for Ahrensbach. Was his return to an earlier point in the weave perhaps a culmination of all the blessings she’d showered upon him over the years? Were they also part of the reason he’d survived the poison that was meant to kill instantly? He’d always attributed that to the amulet Rozemyne had gifted him, but…</p><p>He shook his head at his foolishness. He was only sent back because Mestionora wanted to protect Erwaermen, and this was the only option left to her. If Rozemyne’s blessings did anything, it was letting him finally experience what it meant to be family, to be cared for, and to be fought for. What else could he call Rozemyne’s successful invasion and hostile takeover of the Ahrensbach foundation but a blessing from the gods? Certainly in no other weave where their threads didn’t meet would he have been saved. No one else would have even tried, not even his brother by blood.</p><p>The next day, Rozemyne accepted Gretia’s name stone, taking her as an attendant. This drew much attention, as expected, causing Roderick to redouble his efforts and Matthias and Laurenz to start paying very close attention to determine how she would be treated.</p><p>It wouldn’t be long now.</p><p>The day after that, he received another report, this time on a tea party Rozemyne attended. It was Gretia’s first time serving her new lady, and she performed her duties well. At least her service and benevolent treatment afterwards seemed to leave an impression of their targets, so they managed to reap some small benefit. The event itself proved somewhat troubling.</p><p>
<em>My lord,</em>
</p><p>
<em>Today, Milady attended a tea party with Lady Eglantine and her friends. She did well in making appropriate connections this time. Lady Eglantine, however, was the one who caused concern. She mentioned how Milady had become the owner of the library magic tools through a blessing and then compared her to Mestionora, saying she must have the favor of many gods thanks to her devotion and sincere prayers.</em>
</p><p>So Eglantine was going with the story that Rozemyne led her to the shrine like a proxy Mestionora. It wasn’t ideal, but it was better than what she’d done to Rozemyne in the past. At least it didn’t seem she wasn’t going to try to offer her up to the royal family to save herself. Ferdinand wondered if she knew Rozemyne had entered the shrine or if she believed she’d only led her there.</p><p>
<em>She then said she hoped she and Milady could support each other going forward. Milady responded, “I would be happy to continue to count you among my friends.”</em>
</p><p>Well, at least she learned not to offer her support so flippantly. Ferdinand didn’t know what that would do to Ehrenfest’s position if they supported the girl who seemed determined not to choose between the princes, thus prolonging the battle for the throne. He wondered how Aub Klassenberg was handling things. Unfortunately, Ferdinand had no eyes in other duchies, and Englantine didn’t let slip any contact that she might have had with her adoptive father.</p><p>Still, for Rozemyne to so publicly deny her support to someone from Klassenberg, who by everyone’s reckoning would be the first queen… That in itself would have ramifications, though as someone from a middle-ranked duchy, it was at least a somewhat expected response, especially since she shouldn’t make such decisions in place of Aub Ehrenfest.</p><p>Either way, he’d need to prepare.</p><p>The day after that, Rozemyne was summoned once again by the prince. According to Justus’ report, the songs she’d written had not swayed Eglantine, so he was desperate to find out what her heart’s desire was.</p><p>
<em>Milady: I must offer my apologies once again.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Prince: You must know something by now! Tell me! This is an order!</em>
</p><p>
<em>Milady: I’m afraid the only desire she shared was one for support.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Prince: Useless! How are you unable to find the answer to one question after seeing her so many times?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Milady: While I am flattered by the faith you have in my abilities, I wonder how those in the highest heights can expect one as lowly as I to discern that which they themselves cannot. I apologize for my insufficient capabilities. I can only pray to Mestionora on your behalf that she might bless you like she did my future God of Darkness with the knowledge you seek.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Prince: How did he find out?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Milady: Pardon?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Prince: Your betrothed. How did he find out what your heart’s desire was?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Milady: He asked.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She was dismissed shortly after.</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand smirked.</p><p>Regardless of the bratty prince’s foolishness, with the interduchy tournament quickly approaching, he was unlikely to win Eglantine’s affections. Rozemyne’s blunt advice had come much too late and much too veiled compared to the last weave.</p><p>He didn’t know what that would mean for the royal family, but he imagined the only way Eglantine would avoid the wrath of her adoptive father or having one of the prince’s forced upon her would be to share with him that she was on the path to the Book of Mestionora. If she did, Aub Klassenberg would become even bolder, and if she did indeed gain her wisdom, Dunkelfelger would quickly shift its allegiance to her, regardless of their connection to the king’s third wife. The Sovereign Temple would back whoever held the book, and the false zent himself would pass her the crown with the swiftness of Steifebrise.</p><p>What would happen if Eglantine usurped the throne? Would she find the truth about the royal family and bring about change, or would she carry on the harmful tradition? What would it mean for Rozemyne, her supposed personal Mestionora? She might try to take her and install her as High Bishop of the Sovereign Temple or try to use her some other way.</p><p>He needed more information.</p><p> </p><p>Before he knew it, he was teleporting to the academy for the interduchy tournament. This year, Rozemyne would actually be participating, which set him on edge. She hadn’t built the dubiously positive rapport with the prince that she had before, and he’d made more than one overture to her. Ferdinand wasn’t sure if that would earn him the prince’s ire or not.</p><p>At least she would get to be recognized for her hard work this time. He’d never forget the pure joy on her face when she’d finally been able to receive her accolades in person and the pain he felt knowing he’d prevented her from experiencing the same exhilaration he got to enjoy six times over.</p><p>Upon his arrival, he found the students much better prepared than last weave. Having Rozemyne present longer along with not hosting an all-duchy tea party had helped significantly.</p><p>After greeting his fiancé and Wilfried, he went to review the work of the scholars and impart instructions. This weave, it would do no good to hide from Hirschur as he would not be able to pretend he was absent, but he’d already taken measures to ensure she wouldn’t abandon her post. The research behind three of his more recent magic tools was on the line, after all.</p><p>The students’ research wasn’t quite as lacking as last time since Wilfried was actually leading his retainers and ensuring they were at least striving to match Rozemyne’s. Wilfried’s had designed a couple of simple yet useful magical tools. One connected a pen to an inkwell so it would fill at a slow, steady rate, making it work similarly to a mana pen, though the mana cost was much lower. The other could track the distance and speed of movement. Leonore had purchased a few herself to use when training the knight apprentices to determine their limits and rate of progress without having to watch and measure them individually. She had also requested a smaller version that they could attach to projectiles to track their speed, but they had yet to successfully build one.</p><p>Hartmut was presenting a tool that used the same magic circle he’d helped design for Ferdinand’s handkerchief that would allow someone to give Schlaftraum’s blessing to themselves. He’d designed it to hang from a bed canopy so one would only need to reach up and pour mana into it while lying down to use it.</p><p>Hartmut, however, was much more excited to talk about his preliminary research into why Rozemyne’s magic was so out-of-standard. Using her as a base - the first flaw in his design - he had been measuring Wilfried and Charlotte’s growth as they continued to offer mana at the temple and perform religious ceremonies. He’d found a marked increase in the amount of mana they could move when invoking a prayer, but he would have to wait until Rozemyne’s siblings learned spells that had equivalent prayers to compare them to both Rozemyne’s and her other archnoble retainers who were not frequently offering mana and prayers to the gods.</p><p>Ferdinand left Justus to finish drilling the apprentice scholars while Eckhart took the apprentice knights outside to lecture them about feybeasts. Meanwhile, he asked Rihyarda to set up a meeting room for him and Rozemyne.</p><p>His young fiancé could evidently tell this would not be a light chat as she immediately began giving excuses as to why she couldn’t possibly step away. Naturally, he was having none of it, so after a quick teté a teté, he escorted a dejected Rozemyne into the prepared room.</p><p>“Rozemyne,” he said, his voice frosty, “I’ve been informed of the headache-inducing reality that bizarre legends of my past are circulating the academy. Justus believes it’s reached the point that my mere appearance today might cause quite a stir, which is utterly absurd. What did you do?”</p><p>He knew what she did, of course, but he needed her to learn a lesson.</p><p>“That’s not my fault,” she said, crossing her arms. “Everyone took an interest in my courtship necklace, and once they discovered you were my fiancé, they began passing around stories about your student days on their own. While they may have become distorted with unrelated actions attributed to you, I have nothing to do with it. Really, I think you’re the one to blame here.”</p><p>She wasn’t entirely wrong, but that only annoyed him more. “Oh? And did you not instruct students to gather stories about me?”</p><p>Her eyes widened before she glared at the door. “Justus…!”</p><p>“Rozemyne,” he said, resting his forearms on the table and lacing his fingers together, “are you prepared to face the consequences of your thoughtless actions? Will you be able to navigate through the issues you’ve created while socializing with higher-ranked duchies and royalty?”</p><p>“Um…”</p><p>“You will have to,” he said, “whether you’re ready or not. We cannot keep the Saint of Ehrenfest and the one most likely to receive best in class from the interduchy tournament without good reason.”</p><p>Her eyes widened like a panicked shumil as she leaned forward. “Wait, you’re not going to leave me alone, are you? I’m sorry! I’m truly sorry! Please, just don’t abandon me today!”</p><p>It bothered him to realize that even if he had planned on letting her go socialize by herself, he would have been unable to follow through while looking into those pleading eyes. “Of course I won’t,” he sighed. “It’s improper to leave one’s fiancé to fend for herself at these events.”</p><p>She sighed with relief and slumped back in her chair. Then, she sat upright again as she asked, “Did you bring the sheet music for the Goddess of Light song?”</p><p>“Of course I did,” he scoffed. “Did you expect me to forget an order given by a prince?”</p><p>“I was just making sure.”</p><p>A knock came at the door, and Rihyarda answered it to find Sylvester’s head attendant. “The aub is ready to meet with you now. If you’ll follow me.”</p><p>They moved to the larger meeting room where Sylvester, Florencia, Wilfried, Brunhilde, Karstedt, Leopold, and Giebe Groschel were waiting. Ferdinand took Rozemyne to her seat and sat next to her.</p><p>“I have an announcement to make,” Sylvester said. “I, Aub Ehrenest, will seek the zent’s approval to engage my son, Wilfried, to Giebe Groschel’s daughter, Brunhilde. Once approved, we will make the official announcement once I return from the Archduke Conference. Rozemyne, you will ready the Gutenbergs to receive craftspeople from Groschel and Haldenzel to train in papermaking and printing. Wilfried, Rozemyne, and Brunhilde, you will begin storing mana in preparation for entwickeln. Giebe Groschel, you will begin collecting mana from the nobles in your province to meet the amount agreed upon, select lay- and medscholars to train in running the new industries, and prepare the necessary funds to pay the Gutenbergs for their services.”</p><p>That addendum that hadn’t been in the previous weave’s contract was already paying dividends. Groschel was unlike any of the other provinces Rozemyne had worked with, and there were no nobles like Justus or Ferdinand willing to consider the words of commoners, so this would be a good learning experience for her, Wilfried, and her retainers.</p><p>With Aub Ehrenfest’s announcement over, he cleared the room of everyone save himself, Florencia, Ferdinand, Karstedt, Rozemyne, and Wilfried. “Now, Rozemyne,” he said in a more casual tone as he leaned forward on his elbows, “let’s talk about what we can expect from all these higher duchies and members of royalty you’ve been making contact with.”</p><p>Much of it he’d already heard through reports, but as he gathered more details from her and Wilfried, his brows furrowed deeper and his head hung lower. “So let me get this straight,” he said when he’d finished questioning them, “I’m going to have Ahrensbach at my table trying to take Wilfried, Dunkelfelger trying to play Ferdinand or Rozemyne or both in ditter, Klassenberg maybe trying to make inroads with the Saint of Ehrenfest for some reason, Drewanchel sniffing around for more magic tools from Ferdinand with Hirschur’s research bringing him to the forefront again, and royalty breathing down my neck about the library magic tools and possibly my adoptive daughter, who by the way, was engaged before she went to the academy to avoid this very problem. Do I have that right?”</p><p>“And the book exchange!” Rozemyne chirped. “I’ve got a copy of Mother’s <em>Royal Academy Stories</em> already prepared! Lady Hannelore said she would have her family bring the Dunkelfelger book with them.”</p><p>“Right, of course,” Sylvester sighed. “Can’t forget fending off all the duchies wanting to establish trade with us, either. How are you able to cause this many headaches, Rozemyne? Are you my own personal Glucklitat?”</p><p>“Father!” Wilfried protested. “Almost none of that is Rozemyne’s fault! She couldn’t help that Dunkelfelger tried to fight her and that the prince ordered them to ditter. She also didn’t ask for the prince to summon her all the time or for Lady Eglantine to be as friendly as she’s been. The Drewanchel thing is obviously Uncle’s fault.”</p><p>Ferdinand glared at the boy, but he was pointedly not looking his way.</p><p>“But the book thing? Yeah, that’s totally Rozemyne’s fault.”</p><p>“That’s not a fault!” she protested. “How else do you expect to read books only found in Dunkelfelger? And Lady Hannelore is my first bookworm friend! How can we be bookworm friends without exchanging books?”</p><p>Wilfried narrowed his eyes at her. “Only you would make reading books from other duchies an <em>expectation</em>, not a super rare privilege.”</p><p>She puffed out her chest and said, “Ha! See how easily I was able get Dunkelfelger to bestow such a privilege on us? May this friendship continue until the end of Dregarnuhr’s weave!”</p><p>“You know, if you only managed to get a single book from a Greater Duchy, I should count that as a blessing,” Sylvester sighed. “Do you have any idea how much their book is bound to be worth?”</p><p>“All books are priceless!”</p><p>Ferdinand sighed and said, “You’ll get nowhere with this conversation. Move on. We don’t have much time.”</p><p>“I don’t want to hear that out of you!” Sylvester barked. “You and Rozemyne both are going to be the cause of my biggest headaches! You and your insane stunts while you were in the academy and Rozemyne stirring the legends back to life are going to cause me the most stress this tournament! I’m probably going to be fielding comments, too, about all the ice that’s on her!”</p><p>“It’s just a necklace and a hair pin,” Ferdinand sighed for the hundredth time.</p><p>“And for the last time, those things might as well be glaciers!”</p><p>Florencia put a hand on Sylvester’s arm and in her calm, soothing voice, “Dear, perhaps this is an argument best saved for another time.”</p><p>Ferdinand and Sylvester both looked at the children. Wilfried was pale-faced as his eyes wavered between the two of them while Rozemyne was staring down at her pendant muttering, “I don’t think it’s a glacier…”</p><p>Well, that settled it. It didn’t matter what Sylvester thought. His fiancé was on his side.</p><p>“You’re right,” Sylvester sighed. “I’ve got other matters to discuss. Wilfried, you can go. Karstedt, summon Gretia.”</p><p>Wilfried looked ready to protest, but when he heard Rozemyne’s new retainer’s name, his eyes widened with understanding, and he hurried out of the room, saying, “Don’t take too long. Rozemyne needs to bless the knight apprentices!”</p><p>“Yeah, I know,” Sylvester waved him off.</p><p>A few moments later, Karstedt led a frightened-looking Gretia into the room and closed the door behind her.</p><p>Sylvester, back to acting like the aub, motioned for her to sit. “Gretia, it’s my understanding that you’ve sworn your name to my adoptive daughter.”</p><p>“Y-yes, Aub.”</p><p>Rozemyne leaned over to give her a smile and an encouraging squeeze on the hand, which seemed to calm her nerves but did the opposite for Ferdinand’s.</p><p>“Explain how as a member of the former Veronica faction you came to swear your name to her.”</p><p>After taking a steadying breath, she began to tell her story, her gaze focused on the desk rather than Sylvester himself. “I had no other choice if I wanted to serve my lady. I was born in the temple to a blue priest and blue shrine maiden. My mother was taken back by her family, but she was relegated to a side building, and she blamed me for her lower quality of life. I was raised in the side building to be a servant, but then they discovered I had the mana quantity of a mednoble, so my uncle baptized me in order to sell me off to whoever would earn him the most profit, and his sons were… They were terrible. While the people who baptized me are part of the former Veronica faction, they’re not my family. To them, I’m not even human…</p><p>“It was even like that to some extent in the winter playroom before my lady came. Once she was there, everyone started playing and studying together without worrying about factions. When she was asleep, however, things went back to how they were, and they were even worse in the academy last year.</p><p>“But when my lady came, she instantly got rid of the factional divide again. We were all working together, helping each other to get better grades. She even got all the girls together to help design clothes for Schwartz and Weiss, and she listened to all of us. Her retainers, too, helped me gather ingredients and got Lord Wilfried’s apprentice knights to come when my lady’s were at the castle with her.</p><p>“I want to serve my lady not only because she’s… She’s working so h-hard t-t-to…” Her words trailed off as she started crying, and Rozemyne passed her a handkerchief while lifting her cape to cover her emotional display. The gesture annoyed Ferdinand slightly, but it was better than leaving her retainer’s shame exposed.</p><p>“Dear Adoptive Father,” Rozemyne said, taking a formal tone, “when I asked her what kind of Ehrenfest she wanted to live in, she said she wanted to live in the one like the winter playroom and the Better Grades Committee. She, like me, dreams of a united Ehrenfest that will support Charlotte, and she wants to serve me to help make both our dreams come true.”</p><p>Sylvester raised a brow. “Have you considered she might have more selfish motives?”</p><p>Rozemyne nodded. “She certainly does. She wants to escape her terrible home and those people who mistreat her. In this, both of our selfish desires align.”</p><p>Rozemyne’s desires certainly were selfish, but Ferdinand knew neither he nor Elvira would ever be able to convince her of it. While she could understand the reasoning, it would never be her truth. It was simply a weakness of hers he would have to compensate for, just as she compensated for his.</p><p>Sylvester nodded and waited the few moments it took for Gretia to calm herself. “Very well. I accept Rozemyne’s decision to take you as her retainer. Know that any act of betrayal will cost you your life.”</p><p>Surprisingly, Rozemyne didn’t react to that. She just treated it as a matter of course. They had discussed it, yes, but Ferdinand hadn’t expected her to accept it so easily.</p><p>Gretia thanked him, and before she left, Rozemyne offered her Heilschmerz’s blessing to heal her swollen eyes, causing the girl to stare in flabbergasted awe before she finally thanked her and left the room.</p><p>Once the door was closed, everyone sighed and slumped a little. “Poor girl,” Sylvester said.</p><p>Rozemyne tilted her head. “Oh? I wasn’t really expecting you to care.”</p><p>“Of course I care!” he snapped. “I’m not heartless! You think I <em>like</em> it when kids are suffering? I just can’t always do something about it, no matter how much I want to.”</p><p>“Huh?” she asked. “But as aub, can’t–”</p><p>“Rozemyne,” Ferdinand said, cutting her off, “the aub has to think of what’s best for the duchy, not the individual. He can’t save everyone, and if he tried to save children from the former Veronica faction without doing anything for the Leisegangs, whose support he only just secured, it’ll cause worse instability than before. Understand?”</p><p>“...Yes.”</p><p>Her expression said, <em>I understand what you said. I don’t agree with it, but I understand why it has to be the case.</em> It was the more seasoned version of what she’d felt during the execution in Hasse.</p><p>“Alright, let’s move on. We don’t have a lot of time left, but this is important.”</p><p>Rozemyne took her seat again as everyone straightened up.</p><p>“Rozemyne,” Sylvester said, “I cannot express the devastation I felt when I heard that Detlinde was after Wilfried.”</p><p>“Nor can I,” Florencia said, closing her eyes and lowering her head. “To have him taken away again so soon…”</p><p>By someone who looked exactly like Veronica, no less.</p><p>“I had hoped, no - I prayed that you would come through for us again, that you would have some solution we couldn’t think of, and you… You delivered. You surpassed my expectations. Not only did you save my son, but you did it in a way that brought the Leisegang faction to heel. I know Wilfried’s much happier with this arrangement, and you saw how eager Brunhilde was to accept.</p><p>He and Florencia stood, coming around the table, and kneeling before her, much to her horror.</p><p>“I cannot thank you enough,” he said, taking her hand and placing it against his forehead.</p><p>“We are honored to call you daughter,” Florencia said, taking her other hand and repeating the gesture.</p><p>Rozemyne sent a wild-eyed look to Ferdinand and Karstedt for help, but they both shrugged. If she wanted to keep acting like a saint, then she would need to learn to accept the gratitude that came along with it.</p><p>“I… I don’t deserve such praise,” she said. “I was only acting to save my brother. He would do the same for me. Please, please stand.”</p><p>Ferdinand caught how Sylvester’s face briefly contorted with emotion, and he felt the same pang in his own chest. They had separated her from her family, forbidden her from acknowledging them as anything more than favored commoners, and yet she still gave her all for this new family they forced upon her. Ferdinand would never understand why she didn’t bitterly resent them for what they had done, but he was grateful for her undeserved compassion.</p><p>The emotional moment came to an end, and Sylvester patted her head and said, “Don’t you have some knights to bless?”</p><p>“Hey!” she snapped. “Don’t ruin my hair! Lieseleta spent all morning on it!”</p><p>“Sylvester,” Florencia admonished him as she forced him to one side so she could fix any damage he’d wrought. “Oh, it’s just a couple of strands out of place. Let me… Ah, there! All fixed!”</p><p>“Thank you, Florencia,” Rozemyne said, giving her a genuine smile before she turned to Ferdinand and held her hand out.</p><p>He smirked. It seemed she was getting used to being escorted.</p><p>They went into the common room where the apprentice knights were nervously pacing about.</p><p>“Finally!” Wilfried said. “Rozemyne, hurry!” Ferdinand widened his eyes in disbelieving fury as Wilfried ran over, grabbed her <em>by the hand</em>, and rushed her to the middle of the room. “Everyone, come on and kneel around her!” he ordered as he stepped out of the way so she could perform her blessing.</p><p>Sylvester’s hand landed heavily on Ferdinand’s shoulder. “You say you’re no Ewigeliebe, and then you look ready to murder my son when he treats her like his sister. Seriously, though. Don’t kill my son. Your fiancé literally only just finished saving him.”</p><p>Ferdinand turned his glare on his brother, but he’d already turned away to wish the apprentice knights good luck before they raced out the door.</p>

<p>As they prepared to leave for the interduchy tournament, Ferdinand feverishly thought through everywhere he could possibly run into Raublut. He’d stay with the king who was unlikely to come anywhere near Ehrenfest’s section down amongst the lower duchies. Even if he did, Ferdinand could slip away and use the amulet of Verbergen before Raublut got a good look at him. The traitorous knight would have no reason to go to the library yet and might not ever this weave if Rozemyne could keep her mouth shut, which was not an “if” Ferdinand was counting on.</p><p>Other than those two locations and the dormitory, there was only one other place he was planning to go, so he was reasonably certain he’d be safe.</p><p>“Rozemyne,” he said as they made their way to the tournament, “I will have to assist Professor Hirschur with her research presentation, so I will be unable to accompany you for the first part of the morning, but rest assured I will be with you when socializing begins.” Despite his presence, he didn’t think any duchies of import would approach before the scholars finished setting up.</p><p>Her hand tightened in his. “Okay, I’ll be fine.” She seemed more excited than nervous, so he decided to leave it at that.</p><p>When they arrived, he ordered Justus to assist Rozemyne in directing the scholars and attendants during setup while he went to Hirschur, who was placing a magic tool in her shumil highbeast modeled after Rozemyne’s. If only he had known at the time that Rozemyne had had no idea what a shumil was, perhaps they could have avoided the grun fiasco.</p><p>“Ah, Ferdinand!” she said, grabbing a handful of papers and rushing toward him. “Look at this! Based on what you suggested last time, I theorized that this part of the circle is related to the God of Darkness.”</p><p>“Oh? And what led you to that con– No, wait, we need to finish setting up. I won’t be able to stay with you during the tournament.”</p><p>“What?” she asked, gaping at him in disbelief. “But the research–”</p><p>“I’m here as a member of the archduke family,” he sighed. “I’ll be socializing instead.”</p><p>She sniffed as she led him back to her table. “What a waste, but I suppose your fiancé will need your cloak to weather the storm she managed to brew.”</p><p>With a heavy sigh, Ferdinand muttered, “Whatever possessed her to get students to gather those ridiculous legends…?”</p><p>She raised a brow. “Is it not obvious? Either way, it was quite a fun project to observe. I even contributed a few stories myself.”</p><p>“Professor Hirschur!”</p><p>She shrugged. “They were true, and the pay promises to be well worth any anger you feel.”</p><p>Ferdinand glowered and started sorting out papers. Once she was mostly set up, he left her to finish and returned to where the archduke family was gathered.</p><p>“Made it back just in time,” Sylvester said. “Alright, you’ll be with Rozemyne, and Wilfried will be with us. Pay close attention this year, Wilfried. You might be paired with Charlotte next year.”</p><p>With that, they split off, and Ferdinand escorted Rozemyne to her seat and waited with a cold sense of dread for their first visitors of the day.</p><p>It didn’t take long until they were veritably swarmed by Sovereignty scholars who wanted to discuss in more detail the parts of the research on Schwartz and Weiss he was largely responsible for. He’d missed this opportunity last weave, so he took full advantage of the new encounter and his previous knowledge to tease out new information, not all of which was related to the topic at hand. Meanwhile, Rozemyne worked her charms by offering them pound cake with various toppings whenever she caught one in a lull of questioning. By the end, she was sending several to Aub Ehrenfest to enquire about the sweet.</p><p>Those were the only visitors they had time for before Ehrenfest took to the speed ditter field. “Come, Rozemyne,” Ferdinand said, offering her a hand, “let’s go watch.” He led her to the space recently vacated by the apprentice knights and felt a melancholic happiness at her ability to see over the wall without the assistance of a stand. She clasped her hands before her in excitement as she watched the apprentice knights land on the starting circle.</p><p>“Ah, Professor Rauffen,” Ferdinand muttered. He’d wondered who had been responsible for the grun. The man likely thought it a nod of respect to the duchy who’s archduke candidate chose such a “tough-looking” feybeast for her highbeast. When the grun was summoned, all those in Ehrenfest familiar with Rozemyne’s bizarre highbeast recoiled.</p><p>The call to start rang out, and the apprentice knights took a moment to gather themselves before launching themselves and the wild, ferocious beast.</p><p>“What is that?!” Rozemyne asked, grabbing his sleeve.</p><p>“A grun.”</p><p>“<em>That’s</em> a grun?! That looks nothing like my Lessy!”</p><p>WIlfried, Sylvester, and Karstedt all gave her incredulous looks.</p><p>“Ah, look how dispirited our apprentice knights are,” Ferdinand said, enjoying her shocking clash with reality. “Could it be because they see a resemblance to a certain person’s highbeast?”</p><p>“You can’t be serious!”</p><p>“They have a terrible odor as well,” Ferdinand added.</p><p>“<em>It smells?!</em>” Cradling her head, she groaned, “No…! How could they…? Not my Lessy! He’s so cute!”</p><p>He put a hand on her shoulder and said, “They’re about to finish and return. Hide your emotions.”</p><p>Sighing, she straightened up and slid back into her noble persona as she moved to clear a spot for the apprentice knights, all of whom avoided looking at her.</p><p>“Aub Ehrenfest,” Angelica, the sole sixth year and thus the leader, gods help them all, said, “we have completed our speed ditter in record time…”</p><p>“...Yes. You did well,” Sylvester replied, his eyebrow twitching slightly with amusement.</p><p>They finished exchanging the end-of-ditter reports and pleasantries before everyone departed to the dormitory for lunch. A pall settled over everyone except Ferdinand as they ate in silence. He hid his amusement behind his usual mask, however.</p><p>“You seem rather pleased with yourself,” Rozemyne grumbled as she poked at her food.</p><p>“I don’t know what you mean,” he replied, giving her a stern expression that she only scoffed at.</p><p> </p><p>After lunch, they went back to the tournament and retook their seats to accept the rest of their guests. Several lower-ranked duchies stopped by to ask about their trends before the crowds abruptly parted, making way for Lady Eglantine.</p><p>They exchanged the noble greetings and pleasantries, Rozemyne offering her a slice of honey pound cake, before Eglantine erected a sound-blocking barrier.</p><p>“Rozemyne, I have come to thank you for sharing with me your blessing of Mestionora.”</p><p>As Rozemyne’s head tilted with convincing confusion, Ferdinand’s pulse spiked.</p><p>“It is thanks to you that I was not forced into choosing one prince or the other, possibly throwing the country into another civil war it can ill afford. I have found a way to please my adoptive father and maintain peace.”</p><p>Had she somehow already gained her wisdom? Was Klassenberg about to have one of its archduke candidates become the true zent?</p><p>“I must ask you to maintain your silence on this since it will not be made public until the Archduke Conference, but I am being adopted by Queen Clementia.”</p><p>Ferdinand’s mind went blank as Rozemyne offered perfunctory but hesitant congratulations. “I’m not sure how I was of any assistance in this, but I’m ever so glad that you’re happy with the outcome.”</p><p>Eglantine gave her a mirthful smirk. “I suppose even Mestionora may not know all the ways her knowledge allows her to act as Erwachlehren. Because you encouraged me to offer up my prayers to the gods, Anhaltung was able to speak to me, and I have found my path to peace. I wanted to offer you something to express my gratitude, so I came to inform you that Klassenberg will be sending two archscholars to become librarians in the Royal Academy, and I am currently in talks with another duchy to find a third.”</p><p>Rozemyne’s eyes lit up as she clasped her hands in front of her. “Oh, my! Lady Eglantine! Never have I been so grateful to count you among my friends! I’m sure Professor Solange will be most pleased to hear this when you tell her! Oh, to have the library running to full capacity as it was always meant to! Think of all the new reading materials they’ll be able to process and restore! I can’t wait to see the library operating as it did before!”</p><p>“My, as expected of one blessed by Mestionora,” Eglantine giggled. They chatted happily for another few moments before she said her goodbyes.</p><p>Ferdinand wanted to grasp his pounding head. What in the world did this mean? She had undoubtedly found at least one tablet, so she knew about the Book of Mestionora. What drove her to seek an adoption from the second queen? How had she convinced Aub Klassenberg to relent on their determination to have her become first queen? Had she sold it as simply buying time to see which of the princes might obtain the Grutrissheit? And what was she planning to do with Rozemyne?</p><p>Rozemyne turned to him, her hand shoved deep into the feystone pouch at her belt. “Ferdinand, isn’t this the most wonderful news you’ve ever heard? Just think of all the magic tools they’ll be able to revive! I bet they’d let you see them if you made them part of your research with Hirschur! In fact, you should both focus on making wonderful tools for our library!”</p><p>Just as he was admonishing her, he caught several flashes of blue coming their way, and he looked up to see Heisshitze and his band of buffoons coming their way.</p><p>Ah, it was time to gather materials.</p><p>As Heisshitze approached, he called out, “Where is the fiancé of Lord Ferdinand?!”</p><p>Ferdinand sighed and said, “This is Rozemyne, archduke candidate of Ehrenfest and my fiancé.”</p><p>Heisshitze and the knights all gathered round with various cries of, “Oh? Let me see!” and “What? That’s her?!”</p><p>“Is…Is this really the girl who defeated Lord Lestilaut?” Heisshitze asked.</p><p>Rozemyne offered him a proper greeting and said, “Yes, I am the one who won the ditter for the library magic tools.”</p><p>“Really? But…you’re so…weak-looking.”</p><p>Rozemyne tilted her head, placed a hand on her cheek, and asked, “Ferdinand, is it perhaps a common issue among Dunkelfelger men to underestimate their opponents?”</p><p>He smirked internally but offered her a disappointed sigh. “So it seems, Rozemyne.”</p><p>“Ah, I see,” she nodded. “I suppose that explains why they lost so handily.”</p><p>“Hey!” Heisshitze shouted amongst the protests of his fellow knights. “I’ll show you how ditter’s really played! Let’s go, Ferdinand!”</p><p>Ferdinand shook his head. “Unfortunately, I must stay here and greet guests with my fiancé.”</p><p>“But–!”</p><p>Heisshitze was cut off by Aub Dunkelfelger’s arrival. The man, trailed by his frantic-looking daughter and holding a book so large that the previous Rozemyne would not have been able to lift it alone, said, “Are you Lady Rozemyne, the archduke candidate who asked Hannelore to borrow a book about Dunkelfelger’s heroic knights?”</p><p>With some difficulty, she pulled her eyes away from the massive volume and smiled at the aub. “Indeed. I am Rozemyne, and I am privileged to call Lady Hannelore a dear friend.” The two girls exchanged smiles as the aub held his chin and studied her.</p><p>“Hmm… Since you’ve already provided her with your book, I will freely hand this over.” He thumped the book down in front of her and stood back, crossing his arms with a pleased smile. It faltered, however, as he watched Rozemyne’s eyes light up while she placed an adoring hand on the cover.</p><p>“I thank you ever so much for generously lending me this wonderful book! I will treasure all the stories within.”</p><p>“HA!” Aub Dunkelfelger barked. “A girl so enamored with knights is truly a good match for Lord Ferdinand! I will wait with bated breath to hear more stories of your exploits on the ditter field!”</p><p>Rozemyne looked up from the book and tilted her head as Hannelore tried to talk her father down. “My sincerest apologies, but I will not be taking the knight course.”</p><p>“SAY WHAT?!” he bellowed, drawing the eyes of everyone within earshot.</p><p>Ferdinand sighed heavily as Hannelore cried, “Father! Please! I already told you that! Lady Rozemyne will be taking the archduke and scholar courses!”</p><p>“Ferdinand!” he yelled. “How can you, such an outstanding knight, not have your fiancé, who bested my son in ditter, join the knight course?!”</p><p>“I am not a knight, and she does not want to take it.”</p><p>“Why not?!” he demanded.</p><p>Ferdinand looked to Rozemyne, demanding with his stare, <em>Show me what you can do.</em></p><p>Her face said, <em>You’re really expecting me to properly socialize with Aub Dunkelfelger when he’s so high above us but acts like this?</em> Still, she cast her sorrow-filled eyes down the exact way Angelica did whenever she didn’t want to do something and said, “My sincerest apologies again. As you might have heard, I have always been a sickly child, but then I suffered an attack that left me in a jureve for over a year just prior to coming to the Academy. I have only recently recovered enough to move without the assistance of magic tools. I am afraid I am simply not able to meet the physical demands of the knight course.”</p><p>Hannelore was practically beside herself as she tried to admonish her father for being so inconsiderate, but he simply ignored her. “So a sickly first-year girl just recently out of a year-long jureve beat my son, the next Aub Dunkelfelger, in ditter?!”</p><p>One of the knights yelled, “She may be weak, but I heard she used underhanded tricks to win!”</p><p>“She really is the Lord of Evil’s fiancé!” another cried.</p><p>“AH! Why wasn’t I here to see it?!”</p><p>The aub slammed his fist on the table. “Ditter us! Let’s see what you two can do together!”</p><p>Rozemyne slowly slid the book off the table into Brunhilde’s waiting hands as Ferdinand smiled at Aub Dunkelfelger. “As we have nothing to gain from this, nor do we have anything to offer, I see no reason to participate in a ditter.”</p><p>“If we win, we can challenge you again next year! If you win, we’ll lend you more books!”</p><p>Ferdinand dropped a hand on Rozemyne’s shoulder before she could say anything foolish just as Hannelore tugged on her father’s arm and got his attention. “Father! I’ve already agreed to exchange them with Lady Rozemyne!”</p><p>“No,” he said, waving her off, “I mean books only the archduke family ever reads.”</p><p>Rozemyne’s eyes could have set the God of Darkness’ cape ablaze. Ferdinand squeezed her shoulder and said, “So there’s nothing for me to gain in this endeavor. You may challenge Rozemyne to ditter if she accepts those terms, but I’ll have no part of it.”</p><p>The knights, of course, could not remain silent.</p><p>“To abandon your fiancé so thoroughly!”</p><p>“You really are the Lord of Evil!”</p><p>…Why did they sound so thrilled?</p><p>His attention was drawn back to Rozemyne as she tugged on his sleeve and said, “Ferdinand…”</p><p>He shook his head. “I will benefit nothing from this game.”</p><p>Her eyes darted around before she said, “I’ll let you read the book, too!”</p><p>“I don’t want to.”</p><p>“I’ll… I’ll add more circles to your cape!”</p><p>“You promised to do so already.” Though the offer did make his heart leap.</p><p>She growled in frustration as she ran out of incentives to offer him, and on cue, Heisshitze stepped forward. “Aub Dunkelfelger, leave this to me!”</p><p>“Hmm… Very well, Heisshitze,” he said, stepping back and allowing his knight commander to plop down in the chair in front of them.</p><p>He leaned forward on his elbow and said, “One flammerzung fruit.”</p><p>As Ferdinand pretended to consider the offer, the knights behind Heisshitze began patting his back and congratulating him. He did still have the fruit from last weave, but having two would certainly open up some other possibilities…</p><p>Still, he knew he could get more just by remaining silent.</p><p> </p><p>“One windvogel feather.”</p><p>Ferdinand crossed his arms.</p><p>“One feuerhörnchen hide. You can pick which–”</p><p>“All of them,” Ferdinand interrupted, “and add some blitzfleige powder. Your cape is worth that much, no?” He might as well get some materials he didn’t already have.</p><p>“Ngh…!” Heisshitze lowered his head as he ground his teeth, obviously weighing the financial costs against his desire to challenge him. “...Deal! For my cape!”</p><p>“Very well,” he said. “As for what we should protect…”</p><p>“Isn’t it obvious?” Aub Dunkelfelger yelled. “Lord Ferdinand should protect his fiancé, the Saint of Ehrenfest!”</p><p>Ferdinand pretended to be displeased as Heisshitze declared his intention to protect the loudly protesting Hannelore. This time, Rozemyne couldn’t be mad at him for dragging her into it even though she was a vital part of his strategy. “Fear not, Rozemyne,” he said, turning to her. “I shall protect you without fail.”</p><p>She blinked at him and said, “Yes, I know.”</p><p>The knights erupted in cheers and jeers at her response.</p><p>Ignoring them, Ferdinand pulled Heisshitze to the side to arrange the details. “So we’ll play at the Dunkelfelger training grounds.”</p><p>“The usual amount of time,” Heisshitze agreed.</p><p>“And we’ll–”</p><p>“Yeah, and you’ll–”</p><p>“Like always. I’ll–”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>They looked each other in the eye and nodded, their agreement made.</p><p> </p><p>When they landed at the training grounds, Rozemyne pulled Ferdinand to the side and said, “I know you weren’t prepared for this,” he looked down to hide his guilt, “so here.” She made him hold up his cape to cover her as she pulled off three protection charms from her arms and handed them to him before stepping out of the shadow of his cloak again. “I won’t need them inside the shield. I’m… I’m sorry the strength I can lend you is only what you already lent to me…”</p><p>“No, it’s… It’s helpful,” he said, looking away from her.</p><p>He put on her charms and then escorted her over to their base. “You’ll need to be fast,” he said.</p><p>“I know. I’ll cast a blessing after.”</p><p>He nodded and took to the skies, facing Heisshitze as he palmed a small, feystone-sized magic tool. The second the ditter bell rang, Ferdinand barreled towards Hannelore as Heisshitze prepared to launch an attack on Rozemyne. The spectating knights all exclaimed in surprise when whatever he’d casted bounced off her shield and then shouted again as Hannelore shot off a weak attack at Ferdinand before summoning a shield to block the rebound.</p><p>One charm down.</p><p>“Lord Heisshitze!” the knights yelled. “He has tools to reflect physical attacks! Don’t use those!”</p><p>“No!” he called back. “Lord Ferdinand isn’t the type to have more than one charm like that!”</p><p>It was true. He hadn’t been in the last weave. Now, however, when Heisshitze tried to slam into him, an attack thrice as strong blasted him, though he rolled just enough to let it clip his shoulder.</p><p>“Ngh…! That was the last one!” His second attack was also rebuffed, but Ferdinand had to block the third.</p><p>Just as planned.</p><p>As they traded blows, the knights gave various cries of shock just before the blue light of Angriff’s blessing strengthened him, making blocking Heisshitze easier but making it a little more difficult to act like he was being pressured.</p><p>He gradually let Heisshitze bring them closer and closer to the ground, and once they were at a reasonable height, he let one of the incoming attacks knock him back as he threw the magic tool he’d been holding in the air before covering his eyes with his cloak. A bright flash filled the arena with blinding light for a split second, causing most of those present to cry out in pain. Dropping his cloak, he pulled out another magic tool, a black-feystone-enhanced circle of Schlaftraum, and threw it in Heisshitze’s face. The tool activated on contact with his skin, and the man fell limp. Ferdinand blasted past him as he began to tumble from his highbeast. He reverted his sword back to its schtappe form and swooped down, grabbing Hannelore with bands of light and hoisting her into the air.</p><p>“Hey! Did he just blind him then put him to sleep?!”</p><p>“What a dirty trick!”</p><p>“Yeah, that’s what I came to see!”</p><p>As Aub Dunkelfelger called the game, Ferdinand recalled how upset Rozemyne was about the injuries he’d caused her friend, so he made sure to catch the girl this time as he headed back down to the ground.</p><p>“Wow! She really is a saint!”</p><p>Ferdinand turned and, unsurprisingly, found Rozemyne healing Heisshitze. As he flew down to meet her, she looked up at him, saw him holding an uninjured Hannelore, and then scowled.</p><p>The crowd all let out various cries of exhilarated shock as several yelled, “WHOA! SHE REALLY IS THE LORD OF EVIL’S FIANCÉ!”</p><p>Ferdinand alighted from his highbeast, set Hannelore down, and approached his displeased fiancé. “I hope you will show the same mercy to your allies as you did your enemies.”</p><p>With a harumph, she cast her healing on him and muttered, “That was anticlimactic. I was expecting it to take longer.”</p><p>“We didn’t have time. Dunkelfelger’s turn for speed ditter is coming soon. You’ve now received the right to borrow your books. I don’t see why you’re offering me nothing but complaints.”</p><p>The smile she gave him was cold, but the fury blazing in her eyes warmed his heart.</p><p> </p><p>They arrived back in time to see a few of the upper duchies play ditter, much to Rozemyne’s excitement, and then cleanup began. Rozemyne left with Wilfried to go assist while Sylvester walked over and sat in the chair next to Ferdinand.</p><p>“So imagine my surprise when I look over and see you swarmed by blue-clad knights led by none other than Aub Dunkelfelger himself. And then imagine my further surprise when you just casually follow them off to their ditter field, taking my adoptive daughter with you, not saying a word to me.”</p><p>“Strange,” Ferdinand said, “I had left word with one of Rozemyne’s retainers. Did they fail to report to you?”</p><p>“Uh, yeah, but don’t you think you should’ve at least clued me, Aub Ehrenfest, in on what you were doing? What were the stakes this time?”</p><p>Ferdinand shrugged. “Some materials and books from Aub Dunkelfelger for Rozemyne to read.”</p><p>“Of course it was,” he sighed, rubbing his forehead. “It’s always the same with you two. What would they have won if you’d lost?”</p><p>“The right to challenge me again next year and Heisshitze’s cape.”</p><p>“That’s it?”</p><p>“That’s all they asked for.”</p><p>Sylvester covered his mouth as he tried not to splutter with laughter. “How many times does that make now that you fleeced that poor man by taunting him with his cape?”</p><p>He shrugged again. “Not enough for him to learn his lesson.”</p><p>“At least they can’t challenge you again next year, I guess.”</p><p>They talked until fifth bell approached at which point the students began flying down to the grounds for the award ceremony. As the royal family alighted on the stage, Ferdinand sat a little further back, even knowing Rablaut would not be able to see him from the stage. After the king’s opening speech, they announced the awards for ditter, research, and number of visitors.</p><p>Finally, the academic awards were announced. There were several Ehrenfest students who were named honor students, most of Rozemyne’s, Charlotte’s, and Wilfried’s retainers included. Then, Ferdinand sat forward as Rozemyne was named the first-year first-in-class overall. Wilfried was among the honor students named along with Philine and Roderick. Wilfried escorted her to where the other students were waiting, and with all the grace of her mother Elvira, she ascended and crossed the stage, glancing at the audience until she found Ferdinand. Her polite smile warmed a little before she turned toward the king and knelt.</p><p>He praised her for her hard work and for helping lead so many in Ehrenfest to achieve higher grades. When she finally stood, the Ehrenfest and Dunkelfelger sections each gave her loud applause, prompting at least most of the others to clap along out of politeness. Her face practically glowed at the praise, making Ferdinand feel both guilty for denying her this before and glad he could correct his mistake this time.</p><p>When all the awards were given and they returned to the dormitory to prepare for dinner, Rozemyne walked over to Ferdinand, puffed out her chest, and said, “I placed first-in-class!”</p><p>“So you did.”</p><p>“Praise me!”</p><p>He stared at her for a moment before smiling and saying, “Well done.”</p><p>Her cheeks flushed with pleasure as she giggled to herself about receiving those simple words before she glided over to her “blood” family seeking more affirmations. To keep things somewhat fair, he offered congratulations to Wilfried as well, though he wondered why he bothered when the boy stared at him in shock.</p><p> </p><p>As the attendants were clearing away what remained of dinner, Hirschur came barreling into the dormitory, holding a large stack of papers. “Ferdinand!” she called, rushing over to him. “Look at this! The Sovereignty scholars said this part of the circle looks very similar to one they’ve seen in some older documents. They believe it involves the God of Life.”</p><p>“Oh? Show me,” Ferdinand said as Hirschur set the papers down on a nearby table and pulled out the relevant one. “Here, this gap. You had theorized something similar, correct? The circle they compared it to, though, was quite different. When I showed them what you proposed, they then told me about this one that they’d seen on some of the more ancient magic tools.”</p><p>“Hmm… I’ve never seen this before,” he muttered, scanning the intricate swirls and lines. “They’ve successfully combined the God of Life with several others here.” He’d seen it done a couple of times before, but it was exceedingly rare. To find another specimen was fascinating.</p><p>“Right?” Hirschur said, pulling out several other pages.</p><p>They began pouring over the notes she’d taken from the scholars, and moments later, Rozemyne interrupted them. “Ferdinand, Professor Hirschur, will you have breakfast?”</p><p>They both looked up, the trance broken. He glanced at the window and frowned. “Ah, morning already. Professor Hirschur, will you stay for breakfast?”</p><p>“No, I have to finish putting this together.” She gathered her papers and then looked up at him. “I’ve worried about you for quite some time. You said nothing but boredom and melancholy awaited you following your graduation, Ferdinand, but did that come to pass? Have you…” She glanced over at Rozemyne, then turned back to him. “Have you at least found a little joy in Ehrenfest?”</p><p>Ferdinand’s eyes were drawn to Rozemyne, who stared at him expectantly, before he looked out the window and considered the time he’d spent since leaving the Academy, both in the previous and current weave.</p><p>There was so, so much pain, from his brother letting Veronica chase him into the temple to watching Rozemyne die, but there had been other moments too, from things as simple as eating a delicious meal without questioning if it was poisoned to learning what it meant to be truly cared for.</p><p>With a small, heartfelt smile, he said, “Yes, I believe I have.”</p><p>Professor Hirschur returned the expression, her face softening. “I’m glad. I will be waiting to hear from you, whether it be about new magic tools, research results, or…” Once again, her gaze landed on Rozemyne. “...future tales of romance. Do keep in contact.”</p><p>“He will!” Rozemyne chirped, making Ferdinand grimace.</p><p> </p><p>After a short nap, Justus helped Ferdinand dress, and Eckhart readied himself to escort Angelica. When they entered the common room, Rozemyne came to greet them but widened her eyes at Eckhart. “My, you’re dressed rather formally, Dear Brother.”</p><p>“Of course,” he said, “since I’m escorting your guard knight.”</p><p>“You’re escorting Angelica?” she gasped, her hand covering her mouth like Elvira’s would.</p><p>Eckhart snorted. “You didn’t know?”</p><p>She shook her head. “Lieseleta wouldn’t say, and Angelia…”</p><p>“...Is Angelica,” Eckhart finished for her. “I have you to blame for this, you know. As a widower, I was able to dodge any other engagements by saying I wouldn’t marry again until Lord Ferdinand did, and now here you are.”</p><p>“Here I am, indeed!” she said with a bright smile. Just as quickly, however, she tilted her head and placed a hand on her cheek. “Hmmm… Won’t that mean it’ll be another six years before you can get married? Isn’t that too sad for Angelica?”</p><p>Ferdinand sighed. Six years to remove his enemies, set up a zent, take over a duchy, and convince Rozemyne to truly see him as her God of Darkness, not her Erwachlehren. Would there be enough time?</p><p>Eckhart’s scoff brought him back to the conversation at hand. “It’s not sad for her at all. She wants to be your guard knight for as long as possible, so anything to delay the marriage is fine by her.”</p><p>“How do you feel about it, then?”</p><p>“Me?” he asked before casting his gaze far into the past and sighing heavily. “Let’s just say I really had no plans to remarry, but I can’t really complain.”</p><p>When Rozemyne placed a comforting hand on his arm, he looked down at his little sister with a sincere smile.</p><p>The common room began to stir, and they all turned to see Angelica coming down the stairs, holding Stenluke in her hands.</p><p>“Oh!” Rozemyne gasped, her hand covering her mouth once again.</p><p>With practiced movements, Eckhart stepped forward and casually stated, “I see they’ve made you quite beautiful. I look forward to seeing your sword dance.”</p><p>Once Angelica thanked him, Rozemyne approached her and asked, “Angelica, I heard you’re engaged to my older brother.”</p><p>“Indeed, I am.”</p><p>Behind her, Angelica’s parents were looking on with despair.</p><p>“How do you feel about it?”</p><p>Giving an ethereal smile, Angelica replied, “Of course, I’m happy with it. I said I would trust my master with this, and he selected Lord Eckhart, who is truly very strong. Though I don’t think he’s as strong as Lord Ferdinand.”</p><p>“Indeed, I am not!” Eckhart declared with a boyish grin as Rozemyne surreptitiously slid between her guard knight and Ferdiand. The whole conversation made him sigh and hold a hand to his forehead.</p><p>Third bell rang, and everyone related to the graduation departed, leaving a rather quiet common room by comparison. Motioning to Justus, Ferdinand led Rozemyne into a meeting room. She looked at him quizzically but then widened her eyes and blushed slightly as he knelt before her and took both her hands in his. “Rozemyne, I need you to listen to me.”</p><p>“Y-yes?” she squeaked.</p><p>“Whatever you do, do not sing along with any songs, do not think about blessing anyone, don’t… Don’t do anything that has led to a blessing before. Please.”</p><p>She blinked for a moment then looked down, her shoulders sagging.</p><p>“Rozemyne?</p><p>“I won’t.”</p><p>“Promise me.”</p><p>“I promise.”</p><p>He searched her gaze for any sign she didn’t understand before nodding to himself and saying, “Good. Let’s go.”</p><p> </p><p>Angelica’s sword dance was more impressive than the last time he’d seen it given he and Rozemyne could only watch it through one of his magic tools. Sparks flew from the glowing mana blade as she twirled and slashed, drawing awed gasps from his fiancé. The other girls on stage with her simply could not compare. While it was perhaps in poor taste to so soundly show up representatives from higher duchies, her lack of scholastic achievement more than balanced it out, so he doubted Eckhart would have to deal with any short-term political consequences.</p><p>Next came the dedication whirl, which Ferdiand hadn’t witnessed in the last weave as he’d been across the room and then distracted by the blessing Rozemyne had given. Eglantine was escorted by a slightly older male relative while the prince walked with a girl roughly his age that Ferdinand didn’t recognize. Rozemyne helpfully provided that she was one of the girls who’d been hovering around the prince during dedication whirl practice. While the girl looked thrilled, the prince did not.</p><p>Eglantine’s dance was indeed lovely, though Prince Anastasius’ couldn’t hope to measure up. Since she was being adopted into the royal family, it likely wouldn’t cause too many ripples for her to outperform him so spectacularly.</p><p>“Oh,” Rozemyne whispered, “he actually improved a lot. I wonder if he started practicing for her?”</p><p>That was improved…? Just how bad had the fool been?</p><p>Thankfully, they managed to make it through the entire morning without Rozemyne releasing a single blessing, and they all returned to the dormitory and shared a pleasant lunch before those graduating went to get ready.</p><p>Once Angelica appeared again, Rozemne glided over to her and said, “Congratulations on graduating, Angelica.”</p><p>The girl smiled and said, “It is thanks to you that I am graduating at all, Lady Rozemyne. I must express my gratitude.” When she and her entire family knelt, Rozemyne’s eyes wavered, but she maintained a calm expression as she accepted their thanks and told them to stand.</p><p>“Eckhart,” she said, trying to distance herself from what she felt was an awkward display, “take care to escort Angelica properly. I trust you know what to do, Dear Brother.”</p><p>“Of course,” he laughed, ruffling her hair.</p><p>“Hey!” she protested, pushing his hand away. “My hair! Oh! Oh no! Rihyarda! Help! Ferdinand, don’t look at me!”</p><p>He furrowed his brows in confusion as Rihyarda ushered Rozemyne away to the poorly masked chuckles of Eckhart and Angelica’s family. Justus was holding his stomach and covering his mouth as he shook with barely-concealed laughter, and Sylvester snorted several times as he excused himself to a meeting room.</p><p>He raised a brow at Eckhart, silently asking for an explanation, but he only received a wry grin before his guard knight escorted Angelica from the room.</p><p>A trembling hand landed on his shoulder as Justus stepped forward, still fighting his laughter. “My lord, it has come to my attention that perhaps your gentlemen’s education is somewhat…lacking.”</p><p>Ferdinand glared at him. “I don’t want to hear that from a divorced man.”</p><p>“Would you rather hear it from the glum widower or the adoptive father of your betrothed?”</p><p>He paused for several moments before stepping into a meeting room with him and passing him a sound-blocking tool.</p><p> </p><p>The next day, Ferdinand carried a bag full of filled feystones as he escorted Rozemyne to the library. When they entered, the shumils toddled over and started hopping around her, calling out, “Milady!” and “Work, Milady?”</p><p>…It was still a bit bewildering watching them treat her as their master, especially when he’d spent six years with them belonging to an arch librarian. It felt as if he’d walked into a sixth-year archduke candidate class to see a first-year scholar teaching it.</p><p>“My, Lord Ferdinand!” Professor Solange said with her warm, motherly smile. “It’s been many years since I last saw you.”</p><p>“Indeed,” he said. “I had heard that the librarians I knew were gone, but I’m glad to see at least one of them is still here.”</p><p>“Yes,” she said, looking away sadly.</p><p>“Professor Solange,” Rozemyne said, walking over to the desk, “aren’t final exams over? The shelves are so bare.”</p><p>“Oh, it gets worse every year,” Solange sighed. “Many students simply do not return books or take them out without permission.”</p><p>“What?” Rozemyne gasped. “How could they desecrate the library so?! Who are the ones responsible? You can’t treat the library with such disrespect!”</p><p>“Unfortunately, I am unable to tell who took books without permission.”</p><p>Ferdinand shook his head. “Rozemyne, you’re Schwartz and Weiss’ master, no? Have them give you the list of students who failed to return or borrowed books without permission.”</p><p>“Oh,” Solange said, holding up her hands, “I couldn’t ask you to do that. I can’t put any more burden on Lady Rozemyne.”</p><p>“It is no burden,” Ferdinand assured her. “Rather, this state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue. Rozemyne may stain the library with the blood of the executed if we do not settle this matter now. Rozemyne, get the list. I will help Professor Solange with the feystones.”</p><p>“Alright, Schwartz, Weiss, Hartmut, Philine! Let’s make a list of the sinners!”</p><p>Leaving her to her fun, Ferdinand followed Solange into her office and produced the magic contract for the feystones. “This contract states that we are lending you fifteen large filled feystones. When Rozemyne returns next winter, you are to return the fifteen feystones to her. You will keep them in a secure space that is locked such that you are the only person with access. You are only to use them for library magic tools.” He purposely didn’t specify which tools as Rozemyne had provided extra so Solange could provide mana to any other necessary tools she was struggling to maintain. “Are these terms agreeable?”</p><p>“Oh, my, yes, they’re quite agreeable,” Solange said, signing after Ferdinand and watching as the contract went up in flames. He passed her the leather bag and waited as she wandered off to the back to lock them away. When she returned, they reentered the library where Rozemyne was waiting with several papers in hand. “Here is the list of the guilty!” she declared, righteous murder in her eyes.</p><p>“I see. Prepare the ordonnanzes.”</p><p>As Solange and Rozemyne’s scholars got to work, Rozemyne said, “Ferdinand, I never expected you to help with the library. I’m so moved.”</p><p>She really was moved. The look she was giving him would be devastating if she were older.</p><p>With a wry grin, he said, “I have a particular magic circle I would like embroidered on my cape. That seems to be a fair trade, no?”</p><p>With a chuckle, she said, “That must be some circle.”</p><p>“It is.”</p><p>She looked away, pink dusting her cheeks. “Well, I did promise to add to it, and if you can get all the books returned, it will be worth it.”</p><p>“Oh, they will be. I will send them a message that will leave them no choice but to return the books.”</p><p>Turning to the prepared stones, he tapped each one with his schtappe and said in his threatening, knight-commander voice, “The Royal Academy’s library is under the administration of royalty, and its books are consequently the property of royalty. Those who do not return their books before leaving the Academy will be deemed criminals, and their aub will be informed of this in the name of the king. From that point, we will exercise the contract magic, for the vow given to Mestionora the Goddess of Wisdom will be broken.” He might as well get some use out of that petty goddess.</p><p>Once they flew off, he turned around and found Rozemyne staring at him, her eyes wide and entire face flushed.</p><p>“Rozemyne?” he asked. “What’s wrong? Are you feverish?”</p><p>She shook her head violently. “No! No! I’m fine! Ferdinand, wh-why don’t you, uh, go…do research or something somewhere else. Anywhere else. I’ll help Professor Solange with the books that will be arriving shortly.”</p><p>He might not have fully grasped what he was witnessing before his conversation with Justus, but as he headed for the second floor, he filed away what he’d just discovered for future use.</p><p>It seemed gentlemen’s education was already proving fruitful.</p>

<p>Upon their arrival at Ehrenfest, Bonifatius grabbed Cornelius and threw him into the air to congratulate him on being an honor student. Thankfully, he’d learned his lesson with Rozemyne, so they compromised by having him escort her to the northern building where she and Charlotte would catch up before the meeting that afternoon.</p><p>In the meantime, Ferdinand followed Sylvester to the archduke’s office where they would receive Gretia’s guardians. As they both predicted, her uncle was livid, his face red with the indignation he couldn’t verbally express. However, the anger instantly drained when Ferdinand offered to financially compensate them for their loss. Their eyes gleamed with greed as they took their three small golds and scurried off. Rozemyne had called it a small price to pay to ensure her retainer’s peace of mind.</p><p>The afternoon meeting went largely how it did last weave with Hartmut providing the information that was gathered and Philine giving Ferdinand the list of those who completed crest-certified work so he could sort out the payments. This time, however, Sylvester wasn’t surprised about the former Veronica faction children gathering intelligence on Ahrensbach since he knew the basics of Ferdinand’s plan to turn some of the children into spies. He, however, was not aware that Detlinde was one of two archduke candidates left in Ahrensbach, meaning she was likely going after Wlifried because she would need to marry an archduke candidate. It truly was fortunate they were able to find a suitable partner for him, but Ferdinand doubted it would be enough to deter Ahrensbach.</p><p>With the presentation of information over, they moved on to announcing who would learn Rozemyne’s compression method - Wilfried, the archducal family’s retainers, and Rozemyne’s family members through Karstedt and Elvira. When Rozemyne asked about the former Veronica faction children, Ferdinand explained that they could sign a more restrictive magic contract if they so desired. As he said it, he shot a look at Harmut who gave him an imperceptible nod. They did not want her future name sworn signing that contract. The extra restrictions would impede their usefulness in the future.</p><p>Finally, they settled on payment dates and agreed to withhold the amount for the compression method for those who wished to learn it, and Rozemyne declared she would summon the Plantin Company for the end-of-winter book sale. She would probably earn higher profits this time since she was able to create more products in the two seasons she’d spent asleep in the last weave.</p><p>When the meeting ended, everyone left save for Ferdinand, Sylvester, and Karstedt. “Alright,” Sylvester said after everyone had their goblet of vize, “what do you have for me?”</p><p>“Do you recall the extra chalices the previous High Bishop had us fill during Rozemyne’s first Dedication Ritual?”</p><p>“Yeah. You found out where they went?”</p><p>Ferdinand nodded. “Georgine gave them to the part of Werkestock they control.”</p><p>Sylvester cursed and rested his forehead in his hand. “I mean, it makes sense. She needed a support base, and with most of Ahrensbach likely backing the first wife and the second’s execution, the former Werkestock nobles were basically just there for the taking. Still, to get chalices from us…”</p><p>“Your uncle was an easy connection to exploit, and he probably informed her of the devouring child with uncommonly high mana.”</p><p>“So she knows about Rozemyne?” Karstedt asked.</p><p>Sylvester scoffed. “It’d be more surprising if she didn’t. My dear uncle wasn’t exactly quiet about it. Hell, she probably approved the whole Bindewald scheme. I’d be willing to bet they had an agreement that once he brought her back to Ahrensbach, they’d have her keep filling Werkestock’s chalices. They were still trying to kidnap her two years ago, after all.”</p><p>Ferdinand tapped his temple, trying to figure out what Ahrensbach would do next now that their original plans were impossible to carry out. “While I would like to assume she was simply building a support base, the second wife was executed after the civil war. It was two years after that when we received the chalices. What was she doing before that? Did she have no support whatsoever? Was she intentionally bleeding Werkestock dry to paint herself benevolent when she finally gave them the mana their lands needed?”</p><p>Sylvester rubbed his forehead against the table. “I don’t know. I don’t know! I’m sure she’s up to something, though.”</p><p>Indeed she was. Ferdinand would need to make the decoy key and have Rozemyne start keeping the real one in her hidden room. He’d have to take a few similar measures around the temple as well so it wouldn’t stand out. He didn’t need to deal with being accused of knowing the location of the foundation or Georgine’s plans without informing the aub. At the same time, he couldn’t tell Sylvester as there was no way for him to know about it yet. What a precarious balancing act…</p><p> </p><p>When the children were paid two days later, Matthias and Laurenz were reportedly gnashing their teeth at losing another year with the compression method, but neither had their name stones ready, and even if they did, they couldn’t swear their names outside of the Academy. Everyone would notice Rozemyne and the boys stepping out of the room to perform the private ceremony, which would ruin any chance they had of using them to collect information. They would need to wait until they could slip away from prying eyes.</p><p>Roderick, too, was told to wait, but he didn’t seem to mind as much. He was more upset he’d missed his chance at the Academy and would have to suffer another year under his parents’ abuse. While that bothered Ferdinand, if the boy was unwilling to pull Rozemyne to the side in the winter playroom, there was nothing he could do about it.</p><p>The next day right before Rozemyne began her lecture, the former Giebe Leisegang came to the front and greeted her only to faint immediately after. It was mildly amusing to see the look of horror then guilt on her face after all the near-heart attacks she’d given him by acting recklessly and driving herself to the point of collapse.</p><p>Once the lecture was over and people began filing out, Wilfried approached his retainers and said, “Alright, we’re going to catch up to Rozemyne’s guard knights now! Oh, but don’t compress while on the job. You need to stay sharp, and this requires a lot of concentration. Instead, you can swap out every one to two bells so you can each take turns compressing. Don’t make yourselves mana sick, though. We still have training tomorrow. I’m going to be in my room for the rest of the day, but before that…”</p><p>He ran over to Rozemyne, thanked her for showing them the compression method and then went to Ferdinand. “Uncle, will you be at the training grounds tomorrow?”</p><p>Ferdinand groaned inwardly as he thought of all the work he had to do, but it was true he needed to train if he was going to take back his old post once Hartmut became High Priest. “Yes,” he said at last, “though I’ll be training on my own.”</p><p>The boy grinned and said, “Then I’ll see you there, Uncle!” before leaving with his retainers.</p><p>“Ferdinand,” Rozemyne called as she walked over, “will you be heading back to the temple soon?”</p><p>“Not for a few days yet,” he said. “While I have you here, though, here.” He handed her the magic circle he wanted embroidered on his cape.</p><p>Her eyes bugged as she beheld the complicated pattern that was hopelessly beyond her comprehension. After a moment, however, she nodded with resolve and said, “I’d embroider anything for my fiancé who protected the Royal Academy Library!”</p><p>Behind him, Sylvester snorted and turned away, clapping a hand over his mouth.</p><p>Perhaps Ferdinand had let that annoy him too much because when he told Rozemyne, “I will hold you to that,” she paled.</p><p> </p><p>After the Feast Celebrating Spring, they returned to the temple, but unlike last time, Ferdinand’s work did not threaten to drown him, though it was still substantial. With earlier access to Rozemyne’s retainers and Wilfried and Charlotte occasionally sending their adult scholars to learn under him, he was able to train more blue priests to pick up part of the load. He’d also already finished the High Bishop’s work that Bezewanst had left behind thanks in large part to Hartmut.</p><p>When the day came to discuss embroidering Schwartz’s and Weiss’ clothes, Ferdinand’s stomach sank. His getting engaged to Rozemyne was about to cost her dearly. Her lack of embroidery skill in the last weave had driven her to introduce new dying methods which led to a dying competition where she was eventually able to select her mother as her exclusive dyer. This time, however, Elvira had seen to her bridal training, so embroidering was no longer as much of a chore as it had been.</p><p>With great trepidation, he showed her the circles for the shumils, wondering how he was going to fix this. She looked them over and placed a hand on her cheek. “There is quite a lot here, and they’ll need their clothes by the time I return to the Academy this winter. I know I can get some help from my and Charlotte’s retainers, but having someone else use my thread will reduce the effectiveness, right? I won’t have time to do this and embroider your cloak, though. Is there any way I can just write the circles on the cloth? I could use [&amp;!*!&amp;@*@)] dying so the color wouldn’t bleed.”</p><p>Thank the gods for his selfishness in requesting such a complicated circle from a first year student.</p><p>From there, he was able to guide the conversation to ensure that she would show the dying method to the Gilberta Company and develop the shining ink with him. He once again swore her and her guard knights to secrecy, but this time, he was able to complete the “experiments” within a day. He was slightly worried to find her ink did not bleed as much as before on his cloth, meaning her capacity was closer to his than before. Was he going to have to make himself mana sick for the next six years to make sure they still matched?</p><p> </p><p>This time, Ferdinand forwent the gathering during Spring Prayer, so he was able to accompany them to Haldenzel. As the children went to see the workshops and guilds for the printing industry, he and Karstedt met with the giebe and went for a short hunt. He was gathering feystones from the beasts he’d just slain when Giebe Haldenzel approached him.</p><p>“My sister’s daughter is quite talented, is she not?”</p><p>Ferdinand nodded, already seeing where this was going.</p><p>The giebe squinted his eyes as he peered through the gloom of the frozen forest. “It truly is a shame that one so suited for the seat of archduke was taken from the competition.”</p><p>“She would disagree.”</p><p>“Would she now?” the giebe asked, his eyebrows shooting up. “I see. Maybe she feels better suited to the position of first wife?”</p><p>“To the knight commander, yes.”</p><p>“Have you truly no designs to–”</p><p>“No,” Ferdinand said, shooting an arrow at a feybeast skittering across the forest floor. “One of Florencia’s children will inherit.”</p><p>Giebe Haldenzel shook his head with a sigh. “So the aub is intent on picking based on blood, not the one most suited to the position. Is that not blatant favoritism?”</p><p>“No, it’s a question of desire. Neither of us wants to rule Ehrenfest.”</p><p>“Then what does she want?” he asked as he followed Ferdinand to where his arrow had fallen. Its tip was embedded in a feystone.</p><p>He picked it up and placed it in his bag. “She will gladly tell you if you ask.”</p><p>“And what about you? What is it you want?”</p><p>Ferdinand paused and stared into the gloom for several moments before saying, “To make her happy.”</p><p>“Well then!” he laughed. “You’ll make a fine subject for Elvira’s next story.”</p><p>Ferdinand did not join him in his mirth.</p><p> </p><p>Later that day when they were being led to their seats for Spring Prayer, Giebe Haldenzel tried to offer Rozemyne her seat first, but she waved to her sister and said, “Charlotte, I believe this seat is more suited to you.” The giebe laughed, and Ferdinand saw in that moment the man abandon any hope of either he or Rozemyne becoming aub.</p><p>After they were settled, the men began to perform the song welcoming spring, and Rozemyne sang along with them.</p><p>“Oh, Rozemyne,” Giebe Haldenzel said, “this song is only performed in Haldenzel. How is it that you know it?”</p><p>“It’s in the High Bishop’s bible,” she explained. “The subordinate goddesses of the Goddess of Earth sing it to call for spring. I haven’t seen another version of the bible with this prayer in it, though.”</p><p>“Well, why don’t you as High Bishop sing it for us?”</p><p>She shot Ferdinand a troubled look, but he merely stared back at her. She should be able to handle this level of socializing. He wanted to see what she could do.</p><p>Turning back to the giebe, she tilted her head to the side and said, “As it was all the subordinates of the Goddess of Earth offering the prayer, I think it’s hardly appropriate that I sing it by myself.”</p><p>“In that case,” he said, “let’s have the women join you.”</p><p>Karstedt smiled and volunteered his wife to accompany them with her harspiel. “She is quite talented, you know.”</p><p>“My, Father, are you taking another chance to brag about your wife?”</p><p>“Rozemyne!” he hissed before coughing. “There are some things we don’t say outloud.”</p><p>“Another?” Elvira asked, raising an interested eyebrow. “I shall have to hear of these other instances, Rozemyne. For now, I’ll go fetch my harspiel.”</p><p>Rozemyne watched her go with the resignation of someone who realized their last spark of hope had just died. With the viscountess leading, the women all took to the stage and knelt around the chalices. Then, they all slowly stood and began to sing.</p><p>…Except for Rozemyne, who looked slightly panicked. How in the world had she missed that obvious cue? He would have to increase the rigor of her harspiel practice. He’d let no disciple of his keep such a poor sense of timing.</p><p>At the end of the song, Rozemyne finally stood and threw her arms in the air, giving praise to the gods. Since he knew what was coming, he wasn’t paralyzed by shock like everyone else and instead concentrated on the circle as it rose into the air, committing it to memory. “Justus,” he said, and a piece of paper, pen, and ink bottle appeared on the table before him. He quickly scratched down what he’d seen before he could forget any minor details. Rozemyne had told him at one point in the past weave that she’d found the blueprints for the stage and circle that called spring, but he’d never seen them himself as he hadn’t come across that tablet in the underground library.</p><p>As people tended to the collapsed lay- and mednobles, Ferdinand ascended the stage with Charlotte and Wilfried. Karstedt had already leapt up to check on his wife.</p><p>“Rozemyne!” Wilfried called as he rushed to her. “Are you okay?”</p><p>She nodded. “Yes, I’m perfectly fine. It seems the circle took quite a lot of mana from everyone, but I still have plenty left.”</p><p>“Sister, are you taking this opportunity to brag about your mana capacity?” Charlotte sighed.</p><p>“Come, Rozemyne,” Ferdinand said. “I want to examine you just in case.” He led her off the stage and back to their seats where he checked her pulse, temperature, and mana flow. As he trickled mana into her for the medical check up, she closed her eyes and gave a small smile.</p><p>“It’s been a while since you’ve done an exam,” she said. “It’s comforting.”</p><p>Thank the gods none of the adults were nearby to hear her.</p><p>“That’s probably because of the courtship necklace,” Wilfried said. “It’s supposed to be getting you used to his mana. I didn’t know they worked that quickly, though.”</p><p>Ferdinand was going to murder him.</p><p>Rozemyne’s eyes flashed open as she realized what she’d implied. “Oh, it’s probably because Ferdinand and I have the same elements.”</p><p>“That makes sense.”</p><p>Thankfully, the conversation ended there.</p><p> </p><p>“My lord!”</p><p>Ferdinand jerked awake. “What?” he growled, rubbing his forehead.</p><p>“Spring has come to Haldenzel! Everyone is gathering outside. Would you like to get dressed and join them?”</p><p>Ferdinand crawled out of bed, his brows furrowed. “Isn’t spring heralded by thunder in Haldenzel?”</p><p>“Indeed, my lord. Did you not hear it last night? It was rather loud.”</p><p>The circle of Schlatrum must have let him sleep through it, which was concerning. Would he be unable to wake in the case of intruders or fire? <em>I should only use it at my estate. I can’t risk it elsewhere.</em></p><p>Spring had indeed come to Haldenzel overnight, and it was a sight to behold. After Giebe Haldenzel promised the children blenrus, he, Ferdinand, and Karstedt went hunting. Unlike the day before, there were strong feybeasts roaming the lands, begging to have their materials harvested. Ferdinand had gotten so lost in trying to gather all the rare ingredients he couldn’t find elsewhere that Karstedt had to physically intervene before he culled too many feybeasts.</p><p>Overall, it was a successful trip, made even more so when Wilfried, Charlotte, and Rozemyne gave him some of their blenrus to make better-tasting potions for entwickeln. It didn’t feel like as much of a waste this time since he still had the ones gods sent back with him.</p><p>Giving mana for the entwickeln wasn’t nearly as hard on Rozemyne this time. Before, she had collapsed after three rounds, but this time, she was able to make it to six before she complained of being too tired to go on. As a result, they were able to get what they needed for Ehrenfest and a little more for Groschel. They didn’t need to push themselves too hard for the latter. It would be another year before they actually performed the entwickeln for that city. The merchants were so busy preparing for summer that they didn’t have time to go investigate Groschel’s lower city and draw up blueprints for everything they wanted.</p><p>Once Sylvester performed the spell, Rozemyne and Ferdinand flew over the lower city to inspect the changes, and just like before, she wanted to cast waschen to clean the streets and buildings. Using her unreasonable amount of mana to fill a dozen feystones, Ferdinand drew a magic circle in the air and cast an area-wide waschen, clearing the entire lower city in one go.</p><p>“Wow! You’re amazing, Ferdinand!” she yelled.</p><p>“Control yourself,” he chided her. “And it was your mana I used.”</p><p>“So what? I could have never done that. My fiancé is amazing!”</p><p>The guard knights with them started snickering, earning harsh glares from Ferdinand with a silent promise to push them to the brink of death when he took up his post of knight commander again. How unfortunate for them that he had a long memory.</p><p> </p><p>Soon after the entwickeln, Sylvester left for the Archduke Conference, and Ferdinand took the opportunity to teach Rozemyne how to make various grades of mana restoration potions, and she in turn taught Philine. So long as she didn’t show her his personal recipes, he was fine with it. They would prove a valuable source of income for the layscholar once she started gathering on her own.</p><p>Of course, Ferdinand was still summoned to the Archduke Conference on several occasions. One was to discuss the changes in curriculum that led to the decline in their apprentice knights’ performance and the scholars’ complete lack of awareness in battle. Another was to talk about Eglantine’s adoption and how that would affect things going forward since she and Rozemyne were close acquaintances.</p><p>The most important, however, made his blood run cold. Ahrensbach had forced through two engagements for brides they were sending to Ehrenfest in the summer. This has been the move that let them take Ferdinand. Since the king had approved Wilfried’s engagement, he couldn’t say for sure what they were planning. There were no more male archduke candidates left for them to take since Melchior was not of a suitable age, and if they were trading two nobles to Ehrenfest, then it was safe to assume they wouldn’t also send Detlinde to be a first or second wife as well.</p><p>The question was, then, which engagement were they going to dissolve - his or Wilfried’s?</p>

<p>After the Archduke Conference, Sylvester gave roughly the same updates as before - Ehrenfest was ranked tenth, the trends Rozemyne and Wilfried started were going over well, and they would be opening trade to the Sovereignty and Klassenberg in the summer. After the initial excitement of the rise in rank, things returned to normal as Ferdinand got back to all the work waiting for him and Rozemyne held meetings and met with her mothers for training and to discuss the dyeing competition.</p><p>The competition was set to take place at the beginning of autumn, but as Ferdinand recalled, Rozemyne did not pick her Renaissance at this point in the last weave. The Gilberta Company had arranged things so that none of the workshop’s or dyer’s names were known, and while she did eventually pick her mother’s cloth at a later point, he wasn’t at all confident the second competition would take place. It was only by a stroke of luck that this one was occurring at all. He needed to ensure Rozemyne would pick her mother’s cloth the first time, but if he called the Gilberta Company in before the dyeing competition, there was a chance those in the lower city would correctly claim they’d received orders to tell the archduke’s adoptive daughter which one was Effa’s, possibly breaking the tenuous trust he’d built with them during Rozemyne’s long sleep.</p><p>Well, Rozemyne often talked about the connections between family members. He wasn’t above exploiting them.</p><p>During one of the days that Rozemyne was socializing in the castle, he summoned merchants from the Plantin Company with orders to bring the High Bishop’s personal hair pin craftswoman. After placing some orders for fey paper and discussing a few items related to the papermaking and printing industries, he had Eckhart show the members of the Plantin Company to a waiting room while he discussed an order with Tuuli. The looks on their faces suggested they believed he wanted to speak to her as the fiancé to her sister, and he was fine letting them believe it.</p><p>Once it was just them and Justus, Tuuli lowered her head respectfully and said with a slight tremor in her voice, “May I congratulate you on your engagement to the High Bishop?”</p><p>“You may.”</p><p>“Congratulations. May your union be blessed by the king and queen gods.”</p><p>Her smile was tight with nerves but not unkind. He hoped that was a positive sign. “I see news travels fast in the lower city. Have even the guards at the gate heard?”</p><p>It took a moment for her to understand what he was asking, and her smile warmed a little when she answered, “I think so since my father heard about it, too. Just like the other guards, he’s very protective of the High Bishop, so once he had time to think about it, he was happy to know she had found someone strong enough to protect her. My mother hasn’t seen Lady Rozemyne very much, but she’s heard a lot about her from me and my father. When we told her, she said, ‘Her parents trusted him with her for a reason. I’m sure he’ll take good care of her.’”</p><p>Ferdinand lowered his head, afraid of what face he might show her otherwise. A few moments later, he gathered himself and looked back up, his expression blank. “I would like to order a hair pin for the High Bishop.”</p><p>“Do you have any preferred colors or flowers?” she asked, fully slipping into her business persona.</p><p>“I would like it to perfectly match the fabric she plans to use for the new dress you helped design, and I need you to deliver it before the dyeing competition.”</p><p>Her eyes scrunched for several moments before they widened with understanding. A broad smile stretched across her face as she lowered her head and crossed her arms. “I will deliver it to her as requested.”</p><p>At least that was one problem solved.</p><p>Ferdinand spent the next few weeks training Rozemyne to make fey armor, shields, and cast defensive magic whenever their threads crossed. While he was reasonably certain nothing would happen that would necessitate it, one could never be too careful.</p><p>Towards the end of that time, Fran came in the middle of the day with a request from the High Bishop for a meeting at his earliest convenience, so within half a bell, he was in her chambers.</p><p>“Thank you for coming,” she said before passing him a sound-blocking tool. “Hartmut has informed me that Matthias and Laurenz want to meet with me.”</p><p>“I see,” he said, tapping his temple. Last weave, they’d sent word through Roderick. It seemed they were forgoing the messenger this time. “You are aware, I take it, that Hartmut has been in contact with both of them for a while now?”</p><p>“Yes,” she said. “I assume they would be among the first of the former Veronica faction children to learn my mana compression method, but since the new contract hasn’t been drawn up…”</p><p>“Signing that contract will allow them to get your compression method. It will not clear them to become your retainers.”</p><p>He sighed and tapped his temple, preparing for the lecture he’d have to give to explain the basic ways of the world, but she simply nodded. Elvira’s education was evidently doing far more than he was crediting it.</p><p>“Well, did they say why they want to meet?” Ferdinand asked.</p><p>“It seems Giebe Gerlach is planning something in the imminent future, but they want to give details in person.”</p><p>“Very well,” he said. “Have Hartmut contact Justus and schedule a time where we can both be present.”</p><p>A week later, Matthias and Laurenz arrived at the temple, both looking a little worn from traveling all the way from Gerlach and Wiltord via highbeast. Per Ferdinand’s orders, they were rushed to the High Bishop’s chambers. Given the nature of the discussion, they opted to hold it in Rozemyne’s hidden room with her, Ferdinand, Justus, Eckhart, Hartmut, Angelica, Damuel, and Fran. The boys’ eyes darted around the group as their blanched faces paled further, but Rozemyne assured them everyone in the room could be trusted. Laurenz nodded while Matthias narrowed his eyes, taking in each of them. He spent no time studying Hartmut, his point of contact, Rozemyne, the person he would swear his name to, or Angelica, the one who couldn’t count to first bell. Justus, he stared at for a few moments, but he took in every detail of Damuel and Eckhart. His gaze was equally as searching when it landed on Ferdinand, likely weighing what he’d heard from members of the former Veronica faction against Rozemyne’s trust in him. Eventually, he, too, nodded.</p><p>“You mentioned in the message you sent Hartmut that your father is planning something,” Rozemyne prompted.</p><p>Matthias exchanged a look with Laurenz and said, “Yes, but I don’t have proof. It’s just what I overheard.”</p><p>When she waved for him to continue, he said, “They’re planning to attack the carriages traveling through the forest near the border gate for the startbind ceremony.. I…don’t know much more than that.”</p><p>Rozemyne blinked a few times then said, “No, that’s quite helpful. Has there been anything else suspicious?”</p><p>“...Nothing with proof.”</p><p>“I would like to hear it, anyway, if you’re willing to share.”</p><p>Laurenz shrugged at him, so Matthias explained, “There have been a few things. My father keeps referring to someone as ‘his lady,’ but he’s never said her name. I think it might be Lady Georgine since they said their ‘lady was arriving’ when she visited that one summer, but when we started talking about compression methods, he said…” He trailed off, abashed, his gaze falling to the floor. After a moment, he continued, “He said that he would ask his lady if he could share her compression method with me, which makes me think it might not be Lady Georgine. Why give that method to Ehrenfest nobles when Ahrensbach is so clearly desperate for mana? I also haven’t seen him contact her. He just sends letters to nobles in old Werkestock, but I don’t think they even have any connection with…”</p><p>His gaze flicked between Rozemyne and Ferdinand. “What is it?”</p><p>She looked to Ferdinand who sighed and tapped his temple. “I am only stating this much because of the information you have provided despite being in the former Veronica faction, but there might be a connection.”</p><p>Matthias’ face paled. “So then…”</p><p>“The knights!” Laurenz gasped.</p><p>“What about the knights?” Rozemyne asked.</p><p>“Our fathers have been making our knights do joint training exercises recently, and Matthias’ father has become a lot stronger, saying he needs to be ready to act for his lady at a moment’s notice.”</p><p>Ferdinand leveled his glare at the two boys. “You know what divulging this information to us means, then.”</p><p>With an agonized groan, Laurenz dropped his head in his hands as Matthias closed his eyes with resignation. “Yes,” the latter said, “but I already made my decision at the Royal Academy. I just lacked an opportunity.”</p><p>Laurenz said, “I have a little brother. He’s not baptized. I… I know I can’t… But…”</p><p>With that look that told Ferdinand she was about to go on a mercy-driven rampage, Rozemyne turned to him and asked, “Is there anything we can do?”</p><p>“He can’t come to the castle or knight dorms since he’s unbaptized. If we find any evidence to bring to Aub Ehrenfest about this, the family will be purged. Even if the child were spared, without a family to send financial support, he can’t become a blue priest, either.”</p><p>“A priest?” Laurenz asked.</p><p>“The temple would be the only place he wouldn’t be treated as a child of criminals. There’s only one way for you yourself to escape that fate.”</p><p>“But the children didn’t do anything wrong,” Rozemyne protested.</p><p>Feeling a headache knocking against his skull, he handed Rozemyne a sound-blocking tool and said, “I distinctly recall having this conversation before and telling you that you had to convince Aub Ehrenfest.”</p><p>“Fine. Make an appointment.”</p><p>“You realize that investigating this will likely trigger a purge, yes?”</p><p>She nodded. “That’s why it’s vital I make the appointment. It isn’t just Laurenz’ little brother. There are several families supporting Georgine, right? I imagine there are a lot more innocent children. Aren’t several of these families mednobles with high mana capacities, too? We already have a low population. Can we afford to lose even more?”</p><p>“Do not make me repeat myself. Aub Ehrenfest is the one you must convince.”</p><p>She sighed and said, “Convincing you will go a long way to convincing him.”</p><p>“I will make no judgment on this. This is a battle you must fight on your own.” Given Sylvester’s opinion of their relationship, he was less likely to take anything Ferdinand said about this seriously. Championing this cause was so out-of-standard that Sylvester would dismiss him as a fool unduly influenced by his young fiancé.</p><p>Once she handed the tool back, she said, “I will talk to Aub Ehrenfest, but I make no promises. You understand guilt by association is the standard. Trying to change that will be no small feat.”</p><p>“That’s…” Laurenze squeezed his eyes shut and crossed his arms over his chest. “That’s all I can ask. I thank you, Lady Rozemyne.”</p><p>She gave him a few moments of silence before she turned back to Matthias. “You said you’d already made your decision at the Royal Academy. What was it?”</p><p>“To swear my name to you.”</p><p>Only she and Damuel reacted, their eyes widening in shock. Once Rozemyne recovered, she asked Justus for a sound-blocking barrier and for everyone except Ferdinand and Matthias to step out of range. The young knight was tense but nodded to Laurenz to follow her orders.</p><p>“Matthias,” she said carefully, “before you make this decision, I need you to know something.”</p><p>With a gulp, he nodded.</p><p>She took a deep breath, held it for a few moments, then confessed, “Your father was the one who poisoned me, causing me to sleep in a jureve for over a year.”</p><p>Matthias had a sharp intake of breath but then slumped in his chair, his head hanging low. “I… I had wondered, but there were eyewitnesses saying he was in the grand hall that night. Still, he’s always said things about you…”</p><p>“What things?” she asked.</p><p>“That… That you’re a… a commoner.”</p><p>“How many years has it been that Bezewanst’s lies have been exposed, and yet he still clings to them?” Ferdinand scoffed.</p><p>Rozemyne shook her head, her eyes cast down in a perfect picture of sorrow. “I am baptized as Elvira and Karstedt’s daughter and adopted by Aub Ehrenfest himself.”</p><p>“I know,” he said with a short nod. “So I suppose that means you won’t accept my name, then…”</p><p>Tilting her head, she asked, “When did I say that?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I never said I wouldn’t accept your name. However, I wanted you to make your decision after knowing everything. Do you want to serve me, who your father attempted to kidnap and kill, knowing that I would have the power to force you to testify against him?”</p><p>“As I said, I’ve already made my decision. If you will accept it, I will swear my name to you.”</p><p>Not an ounce of hesitation. Ferdinand was impressed with Hartmut’s work.</p><p>Rozemyne met Matthias’ eye and asked, “Why do you wish to swear your name to me?”</p><p>Much like Gretia, his story began with how the winter playroom used to be before she came and how her arrival brought unity to the children, erasing the divide carved by their parents. He explained how her absence had left the playroom hollow and how devastated he’d felt at the Royal Academy his first two years there, suffering from the factional divide more than ever. She, of course, changed everything, as the little rampaging gremlin always did.</p><p>Just before she accepted, Ferdinand leapt into the conversation. “Rozemyne, if you accept his name, you should send him back home to gather information, not take him as your retainer yet. Giebe Gerlach is the most prominent actor in these plots, and his capture will lead us to most, if not all, the others involved.”</p><p>“But…”</p><p>Matthias shook his head. “I offered my name expecting that to be the case, Lady Rozemyne.”</p><p>“Then…” she said, tilting her head as she considered something before her eyes sparkled with an idea. “Once you swear your name, you will be able to learn my mana compression method, even if you’re not officially my retainer yet.”</p><p>“I… I would be ever so grateful,” he said, taken aback.</p><p>“Send me word once you’re ready. We’ll make arrangements at that time.”</p><p>“Yes, my lady.” With that, he stood and ceded his seat to the devastated Laurenz.</p><p>“Laurenz,” Rozemyne said, “I will not ask you to make a decision. This is a very perso–”</p><p>“No, I made my choice already,” he said, waving his hand. “I decided to swear my name to you last winter, just like Matthias. It’s just… my brother.”</p><p>Her eyes softened with empathy as her hands balled into fists. “I…. I understand. I would find it nearly impossible to abandon Charlotte.”</p><p>Laurenz shot her a crooked smile. “You went charging off into the night to save her when you were only eight without so much as a knife. We all know how much you value your family.” He looked down and muttered, “You even show mercy to orphans and the unbaptized.” Meeting her gaze again, he said, “I absolutely will swear my name to you, Lady Rozemyne, if you’ll accept it.”</p><p>Like before, she asked for his reasoning, and his story was similar to the other two except he mentioned how Hartmut had so willingly helped some of the former Veronica faction children “as his goddess would have done” and how well Gretia was being treated, even though she was a mednoble from an opposing faction with nothing to offer other than her service. And then she showed concern for his unbaptized little brother, even stating she’d speak with the aub on his behalf. She consistently showed a mercy he never believed existed.</p><p>In other words, he had fallen victim to Hartmut’s Saint-of-Ehrenfest campaign.</p><p>Then again, Ferdinand was somewhat ready to believe the lie he concocted himself after what she’d done for him in the last weave.</p><p>As with Matthias, she asked him to contact her when he was ready. They took down the sound barrier, and she handed them each a potion. “It…has a strong flavor,” she said, “but it’s infused with Ferdinand’s kindness, and it’s very effective.” To prove it wasn’t poisoned, she took one herself before slipping her hand into her pouch of feystones. Ferdinand wondered if she’d let him have the gold powder she was undoubtedly creating.</p><p>They both gratefully drank the potions and then gagged, holding their hands over their mouths. Speed ditter truly did leave apprentice knights weaker.</p><p>“<em>That</em> was his kindness?!” Laurenz spat. “Good gods, I’d hate to be his enemy!”</p><p>“Laurenz!” Matthias hissed, though he still had one eye squeezed shut as he continued to hold his mouth.</p><p>He snorted. “Yeah, like you aren’t about to be sick yourself.”</p><p>Justus also had a hand clapped over his mouth, though for an entirely different reason.</p><p>Rozemyne had Gil and Zahm see the two apprentice knights off while she remained in the hidden room to discuss the intelligence they’d provided. “They’re preparing for war, aren’t they?”</p><p>Ferdinand nodded. “At Georgine’s behest it sounds like. They’re likely name sworn. Veronica often required her people to swear their names, and I imagine Georgine followed suit.”</p><p>“Isn’t name swearing a private ceremony?” Rozemyne asked. “How did you find out about Veronica?”</p><p>Since they were still in the sound-blocking barrier, he covered his mouth and said, “She tried to force me to swear mine to her, and she foolishly revealed that she required it of many of her followers. I was able to somewhat appease her by swearing it to my father instead.”</p><p>“That’s…” Rozemyne gave a slow shake of her head as she motioned for her retainers to turn around. Since Cornelius wasn’t among them, they obeyed without protest. Ferdinand did the same, not sure what she was planning to say.</p><p>“That’s terrible!” she cried. “You shouldn’t have been forced to swear your name. Your father should have stood up for you!”</p><p>“Stood up for…? Is that not precisely what he did when he took my name in her place?”</p><p>“No, it’s not! He should have told her that you didn’t have to swear your name at all!”</p><p>“It was the most expedient solution to prove I had no designs to take Sylvester’s place as aub.”</p><p>She shook her head again and grabbed his hand in both of hers, her sad, intense gaze boring into him. “Then why did she keep poisoning you? It wasn’t to prove anything except that she had power over you, and your father should have protected you!”</p><p>Ah, there was the disconnect. She assumed all families were meant to be like hers. Was there truly another father in all of Yurgenschmidt willing to fight even against nobles to protect his child? While he desperately desired that sort of bond, it simply didn’t exist outside of Rozemyne’s commoner family. There were no expectations of noble parents to act that way; they had to be ready to abandon any child with insufficient mana or any they were unable to provide a magic tool for.</p><p>Of course, explaining to her what she was already aware of was pointless. No amount of evidence could shake her resolve on these core beliefs of hers. It brought to mind that silly notion of hers that he should express his anger at being unable to attend his father’s funeral as his son rather than a priest, as though that would accomplish anything. Such feelings were better left buried in the past.</p><p>Rather than waste his breath with an argument he couldn’t win, he squeezed her hand, letting her know he heard her, though he couldn’t let it pass entirely. He needed her to understand the way of things. “…You’ll find few fathers willing to go so far to protect their children.”</p><p>“You’ll protect ours, though, right?”</p><p>His eyes widened in shock as he froze. Was she already thinking about children? Hadn’t she stated a year ago that she didn’t know if she could even bear Geduldh’s burden? Then again, she’d had a full year in a healthy body. She’d likely changed her perception of herself since then.</p><p>Still, what gave her the confidence to assume he, who had been responsible for tearing her family apart, would act as her father did?</p><p>“You’re breaking your back trying to protect me all the time, right?”</p><p>Gods, she was getting far too good at reading his face.</p><p>“I… Yes, I will protect them.”</p><p>Her smile was as Flutrane’s healing waters, the Goddess of Light’s shining brilliance, and Leidenschaft’s warm rays.</p><p>He was glad no one else could see it.</p><p>Coughing, he wrenched his hand free and turned off the sound-blocking tool. “Justus, Eckhart, we’re leaving. Rozemyne, practice your harspiel.”</p><p>Ignoring her complaints, he strode out of her hidden room, beating a fast pace to his. He left his retainers in his office as he stepped into his workshop, nearly knocking several stacks of documents to the floor in his haste to clear a space for his parchment. On it, he wrote the vow he would engrave into her engagement stone then looked for somewhere safe to keep it. That bookfiend would absolutely find and read it the moment he had his back turned. The obvious answer was to place it high out of reach, and as he searched for a suitable spot, his eyes landed on the silver box hiding Mestionora’s vilest act of cruelty.</p><p>Nodding to himself, he tucked the parchment underneath it. It would be a reminder of the consequences of failing to uphold his vow.</p>

<p>Ferdinand reported what he had learned from Matthias and Laurenz to Sylvester and Karstedt. They both held their heads in their hands as Sylvester asked, “Weren’t you the one who said let Giebe Gerlach go? That he would lead us to the mastermind or whatever? And now look! He’s preparing to help Ahrensbach invade!”</p><p>“Yes, he’s doing exactly as I said he would,” Ferdinand agreed. “He’s leading us right to Georgine. We have all the connections. We know what we’re looking for. We just need to find - or create - the evidence.”</p><p>“And how do you propose we do that?” Sylvester asked. “What is it now? Nearly three years since the attack, and we still only have word of mouth and speculation?”</p><p>“First, we capture the lackeys waiting to ambush us. I imagine that like the attack during Spring Prayer, they’ll use commoners and low-manaed devouring soldiers.”</p><p>Karstedt shook his head. “If they run, they’ll be almost impossible to detect.”</p><p>“Not with Damuel,” Ferdinand corrected. “He’s attuned to even the slightest traces of mana. Our more pressing concern should be how to question them. They’ll no doubt be under orders not to reveal anything, so if we’re not careful, they’ll go up in flames before we can get anything useful from them. We might be able to view their memories, but depending on how the order is worded, that may trigger the magic contract, too.”</p><p>“So capturing them is pointless is what you’re saying,” Sylvester said.</p><p>Ferdinand tapped his temple as he thought over how to get the answers they sought. “Not pointless. If we catch several, then we can use trial and error to find the best way to get information. We’ll lose some in the process, but we should at least benefit something from the effort.” On the positive side, Gerlach was less likely to waste trug on devouring soldiers since he could rely on the slave contracts he already signed with them. At least whatever information they could glean from them before they died would be from clear memories.</p><p> </p><p>It was a week after that when Sylvester was able to meet with Rozemyne who pleaded with him to spare the children of those who would be punished, which he firmly denied. They debated many of the same points as in the previous weave, though Rozemyne’s arguments were better crafted and far more elegant thanks to Elvira’s teachings. Eventually, he agreed to let the unbaptized children go to the orphanage as blue priests supported by the funds of their soon-to-be-defunct houses, but he would not let anyone older escape punishment.</p><p>“Wait!” she protested. “My retainers assure me that Roderick and Muriella are in the process of making their name stones to give to me. Hartmut has been in contact with Roderick, and he’s just waiting for an opportunity. Gretia says Muriella is waiting until we return to the Academy to finish gathering her ingredients.”</p><p>Sylvester shook his head. “Then Roderick better find his opportunity before Lamprecht’s Starbind Ceremony. If Muriella’s parents are involved, more than likely, she won’t survive until winter. If you can have Gretia urge her to find a way to gather ingredients, make her stone, and swear to you before the deadline without tipping anyone off, then do so. Otherwise, accept it as the will of Dregarnuhr.”</p><p>Ferdinand winced.</p><p>“If we’re offering them mercy based on name swearing,” Rozemyne asked, “can we not do the same for others? Can’t we use Schutzaria’s shield to test them and then let them swear their names to you?”</p><p>Sylvester held his chin as his brows furrowed in thought. “You’re right that this is going to cost us a lot of nobles from the former Veronica faction, which is mana we can’t really afford to lose.”</p><p>“If we do this,” Karstedt said, “not only will we be saying we were wrong for all the previous executions for guilt by association, but we’ll be sullying the meaning of name swearing. It’ll become associated with criminals escaping punishment rather than the highest act of fealty.”</p><p>“Well, for the first problem,” Rozemyne said, “you can blame it on me, the Saint of Ehrenfest who shows mercy even to orphans. I would think they would fall all over themselves to prove their loyalty if it meant sparing their lives when common sense says to do otherwise.”</p><p>Ferdinand tapped his temple, trying to determine the best way to steer this conversation with the limited knowledge he was supposed to have. They hadn’t known about the prevalence of name swearing among the former Veronica and Georgine factions until they’d questioned Giebe Dahldolf, and Ferdinand had never discussed his own experience with Sylvester. “Is it possible that several of them are already name sworn?” he asked. “It is unusual for mednobles to hold so fast to a single faction even in the face of such political upheaval, after all.”</p><p>Rozemyne picked up on his reluctance to speak of what he’d told her in her hidden room and said, “Matthias said his father was extremely subservient to ‘his lady,’ which we believe to be Georgine. He and Giebe Wiltord may be name sworn to her.”</p><p>“Grausam did use to serve my sister before she left as I recall,” Sylvester muttered. “It’s entirely possible, though name swearing is typically pretty rare.”</p><p>“Is it?” Rozemyne asked, tilting her head. “Could it not be that since it’s such a private affair, it’s simply not spoken about?”</p><p>“...Huh.” Sylvester crossed his arms and frowned at her. “Well, when you put it like that… It could be the Georgine faction is made up of name sworn. If so, they’d all be executed as traitors for being sworn to the first wife of another duchy, and that’s aside from their attacks on our family. If that’s the case, there are going to be very few of them we can spare.”</p><p>Ferdinand shrugged. “We wouldn’t want to spare them, anyway. Their children, however, are less likely to have given their names, though some may have managed it during Georgine’s visit three years ago.”</p><p>“Still, if Matthias, Laurenz, and Gretia are anything to go by,” Rozemyne said, “there are bound to be several who aren’t name sworn. They’ll be easier to absorb into our faction, anyway, but what will we do if some of them turn out to be name sworn to Veronica?” At Ferdinand’s hard look, she added, “I doubt Georgine came up with the idea all on her own before she left for Ahrensbach. She had to have gotten it from somewhere.”</p><p>“That does pose a problem,” Sylvester said. “All we could do is confirm that they don’t currently hold any malice towards us with the shield. We’d have no way of determining their actual loyalty.”</p><p>Karstedt stepped forward. “It’s not treasonous for them to have given their names to Veronica. If we dole out punishment based on their crimes, that should spare several from execution.”</p><p>Ferdinand nodded. “They would likely be limited to paying fines or imprisonment. The question is what we do with baptized children too young to create name stones.”</p><p>“Can they be taken in by other family members?” Rozemyne asked. “Father can take Nikolaus, for instance, if Trudeliede ends up getting punished.”</p><p>Karstedt grimaced and ran a hand through his thinning hair. “While that may work overall, it’ll be a difficult situation for us. Elvira will not want to welcome Trudeliede’s son into our home.”</p><p>“Can I take him into my care, then?” Rozemyne asked, startling everyone in the room.</p><p>“Explain,” Ferdinand said.</p><p>She tilted her head and pressed a finger into her cheek as she thought. “I’ve been wanting to start a temple school for a while now, especially after my retainers said the orphans are receiving a better education than most laynobles, but I want one for commoners as well as nobles. The more people who read, the more books will be made, after all!” At everyone's exasperated looks, she quickly continued, “Anyway, I was thinking that if Mother won’t accept him, I could take him in at the temple where he’ll be clothed, fed, and educated. He already has a magic tool, so he shouldn’t suffer in the least.”</p><p>“You would treat him as an orphan?” Karstedt asked.</p><p>“You would let him be executed?” she shot back, causing him to look away with a grimace.</p><p>Sylvester hummed to himself as he thought. “You know, the temple’s reputation isn’t so bad anymore. Since three of my kids and my half-brother are all ordained, no one wants to outright say anything bad about it. Well, not where I could hear, anyway. All of your scholars and adult guard knights have been going with you as well, and their only complaints are about Ferdinand’s training.”</p><p>Ferdinand shrugged. He wasn’t the one who’d selected such weak, useless people to serve as retainers to the archducal family. At least they were marginally acceptable now.</p><p>“Rozemyne,” Ferdinand said, “How do you plan to run this school? Will you have gray-robed orphans teach nobles?”</p><p>“Why not?” she asked. “Rosina taught me music while I was being treated like a noble, and don’t Fran and Zahm assist you with training our retainers?”</p><p>He shook his head. “Those are entirely different circumstances. As you stated, I’m the one training your retainers, not your temple attendants. Likewise, you were studying music with your personal attendant, not an unattached gray-robed priest or shrine maiden.”</p><p>She shrugged. “Wilma and Rosina are both my attendants, so they can learn art and music from them. Wilma is skilled enough in harspiel to cover for Rosina when she’s not at the temple. While I can’t put any more burden on my other temple attendants, I can ask Wilma who would make good teachers and take them into my service as well. That way, they’ll be learning from the adoptive daughter of the archduke’s attendants, not orphans.”</p><p>“That…might work,” Ferdinand begrudgingly admitted. “However, will you do this for every child left bereft of guardianship?”</p><p>“Can we not do as we are with the unbaptized children and take their living expenses and furniture from their houses? We have plenty of rooms in the noble section of the temple thanks to having so few blue priests. Besides, having them at the temple makes it easier to keep an eye on them. They can choose attendants from a list of ones we’ve already selected so we can get regular reports. If they are a danger, they won’t be able to hide it forever.”</p><p>“Hmm… Not bad,” Sylvester said. “I have to say, I like this temple school idea. Lay- and mednobles tend to bring down our grade averages, though they’ve been improving thanks to the winter playroom. If they can get access to similar education year round, then it’ll help boost our ranking.”</p><p>Rozemyne smiled. “If we overtake Ahrensbach, we won’t have to bow to them anymore, either.”</p><p>“What the hell are you saying?!” he shouted. “Are you seriously talking about taking us to fifth rank?! We can’t even handle letting more than two duchies do trade with us! What makes you think we can deal with being a top-ranking duchy?”</p><p>She shrugged. “Ehrenfest will have to adapt. That’s all there is to it.”</p><p>“Rozemyne,” Ferdinand said, placing a hand on her shoulder. When she looked up at him, he gave her a cold smile, preparing to put a stop to this rampage before it could begin.</p><p>“Eep!”</p><p> </p><p>At the end of spring, Rozemyne had plans to visit the Italian Restaurant to check on the progress of the renovations in the lower city. Naturally as her guardian and fiancé, Ferdinand couldn’t allow her to go alone. It was his duty to accompany her.</p><p>The meal was just as delicious as he remembered, and once again, he was sorely tempted to take the guild master’s chef for himself. Rozemyne would likely murder him if he did, however. Even so, he made a few pointed remarks just to watch them sweat for daring to keep such an excellent chef out of his reach.</p><p>As the meal was wrapping up, Rozemyne offered Freida the production method for gelatin at a “fair but reasonable” cost as a reward and promised the Plantin Company she’d deliver plans to create binders to store loose papers. That settled, she turned to Ferdinand and said, “Of course, I also have a gift for you to thank you for everything you’ve done as well. I will give it to you once we return to the temple.”</p><p>Benno and Lutz shot him wry grins, though they quickly dropped them when they saw Ferdinand’s cold glare.</p><p>Upon their return to the temple, Rozemyne asked him to come to the High Bishop’s chambers at the next bell. He arrived when instructed, and they sat down to tea and some delicious cookies that didn’t hold a hint of sweetness. “Ferdinand,” she said after the preliminaries were out of the way, “I cannot express the depth of gratitude I feel for all you did while I slept and all you’ve continued to do since I awoke. However, I hope these humble offerings will serve to demonstrate a portion of it.”</p><p>Fran handed three boxes to Justus, who inspected them all with a smile before handing them over. In the first was sheet music dedicated to Dregarnuhr. The lyrics spoke of the Goddess of Time and Liebeskhilfe weaving together two threads, and once both ran out, they had made a beautiful tapestry. She had already given him his spring song, so this was quite a welcome surprise.</p><p>The next was a set of three recipes, one for an improved double consomme, one for a dish layered with cheeses and a meat-and-pome sauce, and one for a savory cookie made with rosemary and thyme, likely the ones she had served for this afternoon tea. He would have to get his chefs working on the last recipe immediately.</p><p>In the last box was his cape. He had surrendered it to her when he’d given her the circle, and he’d been wearing the blue one ever since. Now, the circle he’d wanted would hang just between his shoulder blades, making the presence of her mana that much more apparent. It was obscured by a continuation of the obfuscating pattern at the bottom of the cape, adding to its complex beauty. The needlework was exactly as one would expect of Elvira’s daughter. She must have spent the majority of her time at the Linkberg’s working on it.</p><p>He wasted no time in having Justus put it on him, relaxing as he felt her warmth on his back once again. “Very fine work, Rozemyne.”</p><p>With a light blush on her cheeks, she giggled, repeating the words to herself. It made him wonder how often she used that recording device he’d given her last winter.</p><p>Once he sat back down, they chatted for a bit before she passed him a sound-blocking tool. Raising a brow, he took it up and waited for her to speak.</p><p>“There’s another reason I called you to my chambers,” she said. “Matthias and Laurenz contacted me.”</p><p>“They’re ready, then?”</p><p>She nodded. “Roderick should be ready, too, within the next couple of days. I would like for you and Hartmut to be present for the name swearing. I know this isn’t how things are normally done, but we will have to work around Matthias’ and Laurenz’s schedules rather than ours since they need to be able to slip away undetected. They will be able to come in four days at fourth bell. I’ll have Roderick come the same day.”</p><p>And so four days later, Ferdinand stood next to Hartmut in Rozemyne’s hidden room as she took their names. Roderick came earlier in the morning and presented her not only his name stone but a story he’d written about ditter, which she gladly accepted. She poured her mana in his stone with a grim face as he crumpled in pain.</p><p>“Ferdinand,” she said, addressing him while Roderick recovered, “do you have a magic contract?”</p><p>He had all the ones for her name sworn prepared already. “I will have to retrieve it, but yes. Did Roderick bring his fee?”</p><p>She held up his story. “I’m withholding it from payment for this. I assume you don’t mind, Roderick?”</p><p>He regarded her with wide eyes, obviously not having expected to receive anything for his story. “N-Not at all, Lady Rozemyne.”</p><p>After Ferdinand retrieved the contract from his hidden room and Roderick signed it, Rozemyne gave him a private lesson for her compression method.</p><p>When the two knight apprentices arrived later, Matthias went first, groaning only slightly as she took his name. A few moments later, he signed the magic contract Ferdinand produced and handed over the payment. Then, he waited outside for Laurenz to finish. Afterwards, Rozemyne taught them both the compression method before they hurried home.</p><p> </p><p>Weeks passed, and still, there was no update from Muriella. Rozemyne and Gretia both fretted more and more as the day of the wedding ceremony drew near, but there was nothing anyone could do. None of Ferdinand’s machinations had planned for Muriella to show such disinterest in creating her name stone over the winter despite Hartmut’s best attempts. She’d thought she would be able to wait another year before taking on such a difficult task, but due to Matthias and Laurenz securing a meeting with Rozemyne through Hartmut, things had progressed on a trajectory Ferdinand had not predicted. Now, Muriella was having to rush to create her name stone on her own.</p><p>The day before the wedding, Rozemyne kept looking at the window while she was supposed to be doing paperwork, waiting for an ordonnanz that didn’t come. At dinner, she had finally given up. Muriella was lost to them. It was with a heavy heart that she bid him goodnight.</p><p> </p><p>Ferdinand was startled awake by Justus. “What is it?” he asked, pulling out his schtappe. Glancing through the parted bed curtains, he saw the flickering of a candle. It was still the middle of the night, then.</p><p>“Milady has summoned you for an urgent request.”</p><p>With the speed of Steifebrise, he dressed and rushed down the hall. When Angelica opened the door, he swept in and found Rozemyne sitting at her table waiting for him.</p><p>Across from her was a very tired and disheveled Muriella.</p><p>“She completed her name stone today,” Rozemyne explained, “but she had to wait for everyone to fall asleep before she could pack what belongings she could carry and flee. I have Fran preparing a room for her for tonight. Tomorrow, she’ll move into the room next to Gretia’s.”</p><p>This time since Hartmut had long-since returned to the castle, Angelica would be standing with Ferdinand as a witness for the name swearing.</p><p>As before, Rozemyne dyed the girl’s name stone within moments and then helped her to her feet once she was able to stand. Unlike the others, Muriella wasn’t able to pay for the compression method and would have to wait until the lecture after they returned from the Royal Academy. Since she would no longer be receiving support from her family, she would have to do a substantial amount of crest-certified work next winter to get the necessary funds in addition to her other expenses.</p><p>By the time they stepped out, Muriella’s room was ready, and they all went to bed, trying to get the last bit of sleep they could before they had to wake for the ceremony.</p><p>The next day, everyone traveled to the border gate as a group. Upon landing, Ferdinand and Rozemyne went inside to prepare for the ceremony. He finished getting changed first, so he went to stand outside close enough to overhear the archdukes but still far enough away to maintain a socially acceptable distance for a priest.</p><p>The archduke couples exchanged greetings and then began discussing the marriages. “It is fortunate we were able to come to an agreement,” Gieselfried said. “I for one do not wish to stand in the way of young love, even if that means sending away two nobles in these trying times.”</p><p>“Yes, I’m sure they’ll enjoy happy marriages here,” Sylvester replied.</p><p>“Incidentally,” Georgine said, stepping forward, “I did not have the opportunity to congratulate you on your son’s rather sudden engagement.”</p><p>Florencia gave a polite laugh and replied, “Oh, it wasn’t sudden at all. We had been in talks for some time.”</p><p>“I see,” Georgine nodded. “It was to an archnoble girl, was it not? From that faction that so vehemently opposed Mother.”</p><p>“Well, the heart wants what the heart wants,” Sylvester said, his smile tight. “If I may ask, how fare your daughter’s prospects?”</p><p>The Ahrensbach couple stiffened but kept their smiles in place. “We are considering our options,” Gieselfried finally said.</p><p>Sylvester nodded. “If I may be so bold, have you sought an archnoble to adopt? One entering his third year would be within an acceptable age range, and he would be able to start taking the archduke course this winter.”</p><p>“We are not all so fortunate as to have saints hidden amongst our archnoble children,” Gieselfried replied, his and Georgine’s eyes taking on a hard glint. “Ah, and there she is now. I have been looking forward to seeing her for myself.”</p><p>It took every ounce of Ferdinand’s willpower not to step in front of Rozemyne to shield her from Aub Ahrensbach, but as her station ranked above his in their current roles, doing so would be improper.</p><p>Rozemyne performed the ceremony, using a feystone to ensure she gave equal blessings to the couples. Unlike last time, however, when Gieselfried complimented her, he and Georgine were looking at her, not Ferdinand.</p><p>Did they have designs on Rozemyne? Their gazes weren’t penetrating like they had been before, though, and they turned away when Sylvester addressed them again to offer farewells. Their eyes didn’t linger on anyone in particular.</p><p>What was their new plan? <em>Maybe Georgine will marry her daughter to that Lanzenave boy and let him take the foundation,</em> he thought with a derisive snort. She only desired Ehrenfest, after all. Ahrensbach could rot for all she cared.</p><p>The ceremony ended peacefully, and as they were returning, a rott shot up from the forest near the road. Ferdinand and Karstedt dived to the spot and found Damuel and the other three guard knights they’d sent standing around several bound men, many of whom were gnashing their teeth against their gags. To Damuel’s right lay a pile of severed hands.</p><p>He came forward and presented the rings to Ferdinand who inspected them closely. “Wiltord and Gerlach,” he confirmed. “Take the prisoners back to Ehrenfest. We’ll deal with them there.”</p><p>“Yes, sir!”</p><p>It was with trepidation that Ferdinand prepared to turn the rings over to Sylvester. With this, they would have the excuse to search Giebe Gerlach’s memories - if he didn’t “kill” himself first. However, catching him this early would likely mean finding the other name sworn early as well, including Viscountess Dahldolf, who had so helpfully given them the key to Ahrensbach’s foundation in the last weave. Even with her minions captured or killed, Georgine would find another way to get Ehrenfest’s key, but Ferdinand couldn’t predict what it would be.</p><p>That afternoon, he went to meet with Sylvester and Karstedt. “We’ll have to search Gerlach’s and Wiltord’s memories,” Sylvester said. “We need to move fast. When those devouring soldiers don’t come back…”</p><p>Ferdinand nodded. “We have a day at most. I’ll question the prisoners. You, Karstedt, and perhaps Bonifatius should plan the capture. Be mindful that any detected movements against them may trigger a response from the others in their faction.”</p><p>That decided, he went down to the prison cells and pulled one of the devouring soldiers into an interrogation room, yanking his gag free. “We already know who you belong to,” Ferdinand said. “Don’t answer anything that will get you killed according to the terms of your submission contract. If I receive no answers at all, you’ll die. If I receive incorrect answers, you’ll die. If I leave here satisfied, you’ll live. I trust that’s simple enough for you to understand.”</p><p>The man nodded.</p><p>“Good. Now, what’s your name?”</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>Damn. “How old are you?”</p><p>“Twenty-three.”</p><p>Well, at least he could get something. Time to start running tests. “Were you ordered to kill a man named Fran?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>So he could say what he wasn’t ordered to do. “Were you ordered to ambush the High Bishop’s caravan?”</p><p>The man kept his silence, but still he was consumed by flames. Apparently, silent admissions counted in whatever orders they were given.</p><p>He pulled out the next, taking him into a different room, and asked his age. When the man responded, Ferdinand asked, “What was your objective?”</p><p>No flames. So open-ended questions were fine, but he would get no useful information from them. “Were you ordered to capture Aub Ehrenfest?”</p><p>Silence. No flames.</p><p>Ferdinand pulled out his schtappe and transformed it into a knife. “Were you ordered to capture Aub Ehrenfest? I will not ask again.”</p><p>“N-no!”</p><p>So silence for a negative answer didn’t count.</p><p>“Were you ordered to capture Rozemyne, the High Bishop?”</p><p>Flames.</p><p>This pattern continued until he was able to confirm they were ordered to attack the carriage of gray-robed priests and then capture or kill Rozemyne when she inevitably responded. It was a ridiculous order. This amount of devouring soldiers couldn’t hope to overpower her now that she was healthy and had learned enhancement magic from Bonifatius. Even if she were still weak, they wouldn’t have been able to get past her shield. Perhaps it was nothing more than wishful thinking, an order given on the off chance they were given an opportunity to carry it out.</p><p>He determined their main plan had been to cause a disturbance on the way to the wedding. Why? Aub Ahrensbach and Georgine would not have had any legal right to cross over even if Rozemyne was late to arrive due to protecting or avenging her priests. Preparations would have taken a bit longer without the priests as well, but did they believe the delay would give them justification to take some sort of action? Or was Gerlach merely using the opportunity to strike against Rozemyne?</p><p>Either way, Georgine’s plan had always been to remove both of them from the temple, which was why Ferdinand had it announced early on that he would be leaving to return to the knights order. He would be stepping down from his role as High Priest next spring once Hartmut graduated and took over. He’d been training the scholar to take on his duties since he first entered Rozemyne’s service, so he foresaw no issues with the transition, save for perhaps Rozemyne’s discontent, but there was little she could do except complain.</p><p>Removing Rozemyne would prove more difficult. She would remain High Bishop until they left Ehrenfest or she came of age, whichever happened first. There was little he could do to change that. What he could do, however, was reduce her time in the temple as much as possible. Hartmut would have no qualms making all the blue priests pick up the slack her absence would create.</p><p>Since Georgine didn’t have time to make any decisive moves until after Ferdinand left the temple, he thought it reasonable that she would stop wasting energy and political capital on him. What concerned him, however, was her complete nonchalance regarding Rozemyne’s life. She would absolutely try to kill her if she thought it easier, possibly by poisoning her bible again, but there were any number of methods she could use that he might not see coming. His best course of action, then, was to continue having Eckhart and Justus train Rozemyne’s retainers in poison detection and assassination thwarting while he kept an eye on the key. Whether or not she continued to target Rozemyne, he knew for certain she would come for it.</p><p>The only question was how.</p>

<h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
<p>I waschened myself before I entered the house, carrying a bag of feystones and ingredients I’d gathered with Laurenz when we went to train. As I started heading for my room, my father called out to me. “Matthias! I have excellent news. My lady has given me permission to share her compression method with you.”</p><p>“Oh? That is good news!” I said with a smile. “I’ll be able to catch up to the others now.”</p><p>“No, you’ll surpass them,” my father said, his eyes narrowed. “Go put those things away and come to the meeting hall. I’ll teach it to you there.”</p><p>I did as instructed, and when Father showed me his lady’s 3-step method, I performed my lady’s 4-step, letting sweat accumulate on my brow.</p><p>“I’m proud to see you putting forth this much effort,” Father said, “but don’t make yourself sick. It will only impede your progress.”</p><p>“Right.”</p><p>That night, our supper was as lacking as always compared to the Ehrenfest dormitory, but I pretended to enjoy it nevertheless. After dinner, my mother and I retired to the grand hall where I read through the notes on feybeasts I copied from Leonore while she worked on her embroidery. About half a bell later, Father strode in and headed to the window, taking a peek out into the night.</p><p>“Dear?” Mother asked. “What’s wrong?”</p><p>“Nothing,” he said. “I was just expecting to hear back from someone by now. It’s possible they were delayed by a change in plans or the like.” He gave her a pointed look, and she set down her embroidery to follow him into the meeting hall. Father shut the door behind her.</p><p>I remained where I was but enhanced my hearing as much as possible.</p><p>“...Ambush…could have failed…?”</p><p>“Maybe they…come…tomorrow?”</p><p>Moving as quietly as I could, I stepped closer to the door.</p><p>“It’s possible. They were told to lie low if they failed and had to escape,” Father said.</p><p>Mother asked, “You don’t think they were captured?”</p><p>“No, I purposely sent the ones with too little mana to detect. Even if they were, they were under orders to dispose of themselves using their rings to get rid of the evidence. There’s nothing to trace back to us.”</p><p>I listened for a while longer, but they just continued to assure themselves that they’d covered their tracks. As I climbed the stairs to go to my rooms, I thought about what had likely happened with the ambush. Lord Ferdinand and Lady Rozemyne were both capable tacticians, so if the devouring soldiers had not returned by now, I was reasonably certain they were either dead or captured, likely the latter. After going so far as to take my name and use me to gather evidence, there was no way they’d let a chance like this slip past them.</p><p>There also was zero chance they would wait much longer to make their move. Father was already suspicious, and they were bound to know that. I needed to prepare.</p><p> </p><p>I woke suddenly, feeling Lady Rozemyne’s mana strengthening around me. Her order came as though she’d given it from right beside me. “Prepare yourself. We’re coming.” I immediately leapt out of bed, got dressed, formed my feystone armor, and tied my pouch to my belt. Enhancing my hearing, I crept to the door, listening for any movement. The sound of highbeast wings came from the forest, and I left my room, quietly making my way down the hall. Sure enough, I heard my father cry out in anger as the windows in the grand hall down below exploded.</p><p>Acting almost on instinct, I threw open my father’s door to find him halfway to his hidden room. “Matthias!” he barked. “Stall them!”</p><p>With some resignation, I nodded and pulled out my schtappe as I reached into my pouch. The moment my father turned around, I summoned bands of light to capture him. Sadly, he had more mana than I did, so it wouldn’t take him long to break free, but it still caught him by surprise, giving me a precious few moments to throw the envelope of powder I held in his face. He had just enough time to growl my name before he collapsed. I’d have to thank Harmut later for the sleeping drug.</p><p>“What do you think you’re doing?!”</p><p>I spun around just in time to dodge Janrik’s sword. Transforming my schtappe into one as well, I blocked his next three attacks before I knocked him off balance and sent him tumbling over a side table.</p><p>“Traitor!” Janrik barked as he stumbled to his feet. “You’d attack your own father?! Kinslayer!”</p><p>“Traitor?” I repeated. “He’s the one acting against Ehrenfest and serving a noble from another duchy!”</p><p>In the brief instant that doubt and confusion stalled my brother’s movements, bands of light wrapped around him. He staggered for a moment before falling over, grunting in pain.</p><p>“Ah, I see you’ve already captured the traitor,” Lord Ferdinand said as he strode into the room. “Are these yours?” He pointed to the bands of light still around my father.</p><p>When I nodded, he ordered me to undo them so he could wrap him up himself. He knelt down and plucked the ring off my father’s hand, dropping it into a pouch on his belt before calling out, “I have him!”</p><p>Lord Eckhart appeared in the doorway and looked around, nodding to himself. “Alright. I’ll get them lo–”</p><p>An explosion sent tremors through the floor, and my stomach sank. It’d come from down the hall where my mother’s rooms were. Janrik paled as we made eye contact, neither of us willing to believe what had just happened.</p><p>Lord Eckhart ran in the direction of the explosion while Lord Ferdinand cursed and dropped a magic tool on my father’s face. “Don’t touch that,” he said as he made for the door. “I’m going to secure transport.”</p><p>I stood frozen for ages, staring at my brother, the horror I felt reflected in his own eyes. Finally, Lord Eckhart appeared, his hard gaze scanning the room again before it landed on me. He gave a subtle shake of his head before disappearing again.</p><p>He might as well have punched me in the stomach. I dropped to my hands and knees, trembling as I fought back the tears Janrik was letting flow freely with his gentle sobs. I knew. I knew my parents, my brothers - my whole family would be executed. I had prepared, even going so far as to gather evidence against my father and incapacitate him, but it had still seemed so abstract since it was something I wouldn’t see. I would just be told at some point that it was done, and I knew it would hurt, but this…?</p><p>It was one thing to know your mother was going to be executed. It was another to hear her kill herself.</p><p>“Matthias…”</p><p>I looked up, and there stood my lady, her golden eyes full of sorrow as she walked over and knelt before me. How long had she been there? How long had I been lost in my grief? I looked around and found my brother and father missing, the door to the hidden room open. “I…” I hurriedly wiped my face and knelt properly before her. “Lady Rozemyne, my deepest apologies, I–”</p><p>Her gentle hand rested on my shoulder as she said in her quiet voice, “You don’t have to apologize. It’s okay to be sad or angry.” Her own moon-like eyes shone as though she were holding back tears herself. “There is no pain like losing your family, even if you’ve prepared yourself for it.”</p><p>“My lady,” I rasped, fighting against the burning lump in my throat.</p><p>“Here,” she said, handing me a sound-blocking tool. “I’ll keep mine in my belt. Take all the time you need.” With that, she stood up, turned her back to me, and flared out her cape just enough to hide me from anyone else who might enter the room.</p><p>I couldn’t hold it back anymore. I hunched over my lady’s sound-blocking tool, clasping it tight as I wept, letting myself scream and cry as loud as I wanted. Pale gray light was just starting to stream through the curtains when my last tears fell. The entire time, Lady Rozemyne stood before me, protecting me as I grieved.</p><p>I stood, causing her to turn around. When I offered her the tool back, she slipped it into her belt then held her hands out, speaking a prayer to Heilschmerz. A light of blessing shot from her ring and rained down on me, taking the soreness and swelling from my eyes. I’d never seen anything so beautiful before.</p><p>“Rozemyne,” Lord Ferdinand called as he came out of the hidden room, holding a large box in his hands, “once I load this, we’re leaving.”</p><p>“Alright,” she said. After he left, she spun around and said to me, “Laurenz and his brother are downstairs.” Then, she turned around and walked out of the room. I followed after her, freezing when I saw a giant grun taking up half the grand hall.</p><p>“What is that?” I gasped.</p><p>Lady Rozemyne turned where she was on the stairs, tilting her head. “My highbeast, of course. Lessy is very convenient. Although Ferdinand always has bad things to say about him, he still makes me carry his luggage everywhere.”</p><p>I…didn’t know what to say to that. Honestly, I hadn’t been quite sure what the dynamic was between my lady and her lord, just that Lord Fedinand erred on the side of Ewigeliebe when it came to gifts. For some reason, I’d never expected them to share something so…normal.</p><p>
<em>Maybe Lord Ferdinand is human after all…</em>
</p><p>As I followed my lady downstairs, I realized that my and Laurenz’s families were inside “Lessy,” each bound with a magic tool attached to them, reminiscent of the one Harmut had shown off at the interduchy tournament. It probably served the same purpose given everyone was slumped over with their eyes closed.</p><p>“Matthias!” Laurenz called, running over with his little brother in tow. For a moment, I felt a pang of envy that he got to keep part of his family when I couldn’t.</p><p>“They hit your house at the same time?” I asked.</p><p>He nodded. “Yeah, Lord Bonifatius and Lord Karstedt just charged right through the front door. Didn’t take them long to nab my parents and the servants.”</p><p>“So your mother’s still alive, then?”</p><p>Laurenz’s eyes widened before he shook his head and looked away. “I’m… I’m sorry, Matthias.”</p><p>“It’s alright,” I sighed, pushing the pain back down before I lost myself to it again. “It would’ve happened anyway.”</p><p>“Doesn’t make it any better.”</p><p>“No, it doesn’t.”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne offered to take us in her highbeast, but we politely declined, instead opting to take our own. Laurenz held his little brother in front of him on his highbeast as we traveled to Ehrenfest.</p><p>We had to stop at the temple first to drop off Bertram. Lady Rozemyne’s attendants were already outside waiting for us since she’d sent word beforehand. Laurenz saw him to the orphanage and stayed with him as he cried himself to sleep. After that, we had to go to the castle.</p><p>They had us go to the knight dorm to eat breakfast before taking us out to the training grounds where Lord Bonifatius was waiting.</p><p>“Hmph!” he snorted. “So you’re the two boys who my granddaughter took into her service, huh? It was a rough night, but there’s nothing like training to get your mind off of it! Let’s go!”</p><p>He was right. I couldn’t think about the night before at all while I was enduring hell.</p><p> </p><p>That afternoon, Lady Rozemyne called me to Lord Ferdinand’s office where they were both waiting along with their retainers.</p><p>“Have a seat, please,” my lady said, waving to a chair across the table from her. Tea and some new type of cookie were presented to me, and after she took a demonstrative bite, I tried one only to widen my eyes in shock. I stared at the other half of the cookie, wondering what I’d just eaten.</p><p>“It’s a savory version for the men in my life who don’t like sweets,” she said, flicking her eyes to Lord Ferdinand who furrowed his brows but otherwise ignored her.</p><p>“It’s good,” I said, a little sad to miss out on something sweet, but they were still enjoyable.</p><p>Lady Rozemyne lifted her hand, and Rihyarda stepped forward to set down an area sound-blocking tool, which my lady activated. “Matthias,” she said, “I called you here to tell you the results of the investigation.”</p><p>I braced myself and nodded.</p><p>“Thanks to your quick thinking, we were able to capture Giebe Gerlach and look into his memories. We uncovered many misdeeds and discovered the identities of other traitors hiding in Ehrenfest. He was indeed name sworn to Lady Georgine, and it seemed he was working with her on a plan to get her to visit Ehrenfest again, though it was in its early stages, so we were unable to glean anything concrete.</p><p>“Perhaps the most important thing to you, however, is what we found when we searched your older brother’s memories. He has no loyalty to Lady Georgine and has been, in fact, looking for a way to join the Florencia faction. He likely would have already if not for your father. It seemed he was starting to get worried and feared he would be forced to swear his name to Giebe Gerlach’s lady.”</p><p>I stared at her, not understanding exactly where she was going with this.</p><p>“We found no crimes he was guilty of. He’s been offered the chance to swear his name to the archduke, but he’s requested to swear it to me, the Saint of Ehrenfest, instead. I would like to hear your thoughts.”</p><p>I frowned and narrowed my eyes as I put the pieces together of what I knew about my older brother. “I…believe he has a good sense of justice. He never blamed Roderick for the White Tower incident, for instance, and instead recognized he was just doing what his father told him. It disgusted him how the other boys involved escaped punishment yet heaped abuse on him.”</p><p>I thought about how he’d called me a kinslayer but then stopped pressing the attack when I told him about Father’s treachery. He always seemed like someone who thought things over carefully and tried to do what he thought was right, though he bowed easily to authority. “I… I think my brother probably realizes he’s only being given a chance thanks to your mercy. We would all already be at the top of the towering staircase by now without you. He probably feels that if he had to choose between swearing his name to the aub or the Saint of Ehrenfest, he’d rather choose his savior.”</p><p>“I see,” she said. “That was also the impression I got from what I was told. The problem is he’s an attendant. If he were a scholar or a knight, then…” She tilted her head and placed a hand on her cheek. “Perhaps I could talk to him about Wilfried. I don’t think they interacted much at the Royal Academy, but he would have seen his character all the same, no?”</p><p>I didn’t know how to answer. It was true that she couldn’t take a male attendant, so my brother was out of luck there, but I didn’t know how he felt about Wilfried. He’d only spoken of him in a political sense, not a personal one.</p><p>Lord Ferdinand sighed and tapped his temple. “Rozemyne, that’s a question for Janrik, not Matthias.” He then picked up another cookie. Was that his eighth one? I’d lost count.</p><p>“My apologies. I didn’t wish to put you on the spot,” she said. “Matthias, am I right in assuming Janrik will swear his name to someone in the archducal family rather than be executed by association?”</p><p>“…Yes, Lady Rozemyne, I would say that is a safe assumption.”</p><p>Nodding to herself, she graced me with a smile that made her golden eyes shine and said, “I’m glad that both you and Laurenz still have your brothers.”</p><p>I sat stunned. Had she read my thoughts this morning?</p><p>No, it was as everyone always said - she valued family to an uncommon degree.</p><p>I returned her smile, feeling a spark of warmth for the first time that day. “Yes, thank you, Lady Rozemyne.”</p><p> </p><p>Over the next two weeks, it felt as though the chaos would never end. My father and oldest brother were executed along with Laurenz’s parents and older brother and nearly all of their close associates - Viscountess Dahldolf, Giebe Bessel, his sister… The list went on, but even more were imprisoned, like Freuden’s new wife from Ahrensbach and Lady Trudeliede.</p><p>During this time, between training, dodging Hartmut’s envy-induced rants, and guarding Lady Rozemyne, I was also tasked with helping Lord Ferdinand sort through the belongings from my late father’s hidden room. There were various ingredients that I didn’t recognize or know the use of, some letters that Lord Ferdinand put away to read later, plans for transfer circles, and some strange silver cloth.</p><p>Lord Ferdinand rubbed the cloth between his fingers, muttering under his breath before he laid it across the table and gestured to it. “Matthias, slash it.”</p><p>I hesitated, but when he glared I me, I quickly produced my schtappe, turned it into a knife, and slashed it across the material. Good gods, how did Lady Rozemyne ever defy this man? He was terrifying.</p><p>More terrifying was realizing I’d failed the task he’d given me. Once again, I ran my knife over the fabric, but nothing happened.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Lord Ferdinand nodded. “I see. Here.” He placed several boards underneath the fabric then said, “You’re learning enhancement magic, no? Use it to drive your knife as hard as you can through the boards beneath.”</p><p>I did as instructed, feeling the wood give way, yet when I lifted my knife, the fabric was still intact.</p><p>“Hm. Eckhart, a knife,” Lord Ferdinand said, holding out his hand. Not a moment later, a metal dagger appeared in it, and he took it to the fabric, cutting a slit through it.</p><p>“It’s resistant to mana?” I asked.</p><p>“Eckhart, hold it up and brace yourself.”</p><p>The knight did as commanded, and Lord Ferdinand fired an attack at it. It dissipated against the fabric, causing nothing more than a breeze to hit Lord Eckhart.</p><p>“Hold it above you.”</p><p>Lord Ferdinand tried to fire a rott through it only for it to stop like it did against ceilings. “I believe it’s more accurate to say it blocks mana,” he said, putting away his schtappe.</p><p>“If it blocks mana,” I asked, holding my chin, “then would it be possible to cross the border without alerting anyone if you were wearing a cloak made of this material?”</p><p>He raised a brow at me. “That was quite a leap.”</p><p>“I live…lived by the border.”</p><p>“Hm. True. I believe you’re right, though. Any noble wrapped in this would appear as a commoner as far as any detection spells were concerned.”</p><p>I narrowed my eyes as I stared at the cloth. “So my father was planning to cross the border into Ahrensbach. Since he hadn’t done so already, I assume he still had something to do in Ehrenfest.”</p><p>Lord Ferdinand nodded. “Not all of your father’s memories were clear. He seemed to be drugged for some of his interactions, but it was also reported that he’d thrown something in the fire that produced a sweet-smelling smoke when he was talking with Viscount Joisontak. This seemed to correspond to the viscount’s muddled memories of meeting with your father.”</p><p>“Sweet smelling…” I closed my eyes as I tried to remember anything that might match that description. “I apologize, Lord Ferdinand, but I can’t recall encountering anything like that.”</p><p>“I see,” he said, his face blank and tone flat. It made it hard to determine what he was thinking. Had he been disappointed, or had he expected my answer?</p><p>That had more or less been the last time I was summoned to help investigate my father’s belongings. According to Lady Rozemyne, there were several magic tools that had caught Lord Ferdinand’s interest, but I didn’t know much about them. My father had been a rather gifted scholar, and a lot of what he did was beyond me, a soon-to-be fourth-year knight apprentice.</p><p>Yet another reason to regret not taking the scholar course.</p><p>During this upheaval, Lady Rozemyne and Lord Ferdinand still had to perform a religious ceremony at the beginning of autumn, meaning all of Lady Rozemyne’s guards and scholars were expected to go with her to the temple. I’d been there twice before, but it was my first time being able to get a good look at it. Our lady was gracious enough to give us a tour which allowed Laurenz to check on his little brother in the orphanage. Bertram was having a hard time adjusting, but he was barely four years old, so it stood to reason he’d be upset at losing his parents and home without understanding why.</p><p>I knew it bothered Laurenz that he had to leave him in the temple while he stayed in the knight dorms, but he was still grateful Lady Rozemyne had managed to save him along with a few other young kids. The current plan was for them to be raised and educated in the orphanage before giving them blue robes when they turned seven. Laurenz could become his guardian, but he’d have to purchase his own estate and find someone to look after Bertram since he couldn’t live in the knight dorms with us. He wouldn’t be able to afford that before Bertram turned ten.</p><p>There were a few other children who were already baptized but hadn’t started at the Royal Academy yet who were living as blue priests. Some of them just had parents in prison, so they would leave the temple once they were released. Some, however, had lost their parents. They’d spent their whole lives living as nobles and planning to go to the Academy and then overnight, their entire futures changed. They weren’t taking it well at all.</p><p>When this was reported to Lady Rozemyne, she had the children of the executed gather and spoke with them about what their new lives would be like. They would continue to receive a noble education in the temple, have attendants, and travel around the duchy performing religious ceremonies. As she described them, the children became more and more interested, some exploding with questions when she mentioned a game where those celebrating the Harvest Festival kicked around a feybeast.</p><p>She made living at the temple sound pleasant, which made sense since she was raised there, and as I heard later from many of the gray priests, she’d greatly improved the quality of life for everyone there.</p><p>I couldn’t help but be awed by everything my lady had done. Would anyone else have worked so hard to educate orphans and give them the means to support themselves, unite children of warring factions and treat them equally, and plead for the aub to spare their lives when by all rights they should have been executed for guilt by association?</p><p>It was with these thoughts in my and Laurenz’s hearts that we happened to meet a priest named Egmont when we were taking our turn to go train and compress our mana. Since we were new, he correctly guessed we were former Veronica faction children who’d been taken in by the archducal family. He started by trying to ingratiate himself to us, which we found rather off-putting. As we were telling him to be on his way, he asked if we’d been “forced to serve that filthy commoner” who was “nothing but the High Priest’s favorite flower.”</p><p>Laurenz and I both had our blades against his neck.</p><p>Angelica appeared from around the corner before he could even finish screaming. Upon seeing us, she sent off an ordonnanz and then pulled her mana blade. She didn’t bother asking questions; she just wanted to know where to stick the pig.</p><p>Lord Ferdinand, Lady Rozemyne, Lord Echkart, Cornelius, and Hartmut (for some reason) came around the corner, pausing only for a brief moment before they took action. Lord Ferdinand strode forward as Lord Eckhart produced his sword. Lady Rozemyne stayed a few steps behind while Hartmut followed, his expression betraying mild curiosity. Cornelius brought up the rear.</p><p>“What’s this about?” Lord Ferdinand demanded.</p><p>When I told him what the vile man said, everyone’s faces darkened, except for Egmont’s. His went white as the temple walls.</p><p>“My lady, you shouldn’t have to hear such filth,” Harmut said. “May Angelica escort you back to your chambers while we cleanse this stain from the wall?”</p><p>Her gaze flicked between everyone but lingered on Lord Ferdinand. When he didn’t turn around, she gave a slow nod and followed Angelica back to the High Bishop’s room.</p><p>Once she was gone, the temperature dropped several degrees as Lord Ferdinand bore down on the blue priest. “I believe we all heard words that in this current environment could be considered…treasonous, did we not?”</p><p>I didn’t care what the justification was so long as the man who insulted my lady in such a manner was dealt with. Either way, he wasn’t going to survive this. At best, Hartmut would cut his tongue out.</p><p>With everyone in agreement, Lord Ferdinand and Lord Eckhart took Egmont away. It was the last any of us ever saw of him. I wasn’t sure what steps they had to take to execute a blue priest, but I wasn’t going to ask any questions. The result was more than satisfactory.</p>

<p>The sudden purge had thrown a wrench into things to say the least. So many plans got delayed or derailed. We were supposed to have Ferdinand inspect the embroidery for Schwartz’s and Weiss’s outfits, visit Groschel to see how the early stages of paper production were coming along, and prepare for the dyeing competition.</p><p>However, Ferdinand was so busy running back and forth that I was certain he was relying on potions again, not that I saw him enough to verify, and with all the political upheaval, we couldn’t safely travel anywhere at the moment.</p><p>The dyeing competition was mostly still on track, though, since the purge didn’t really affect the lower city, and the brains behind it could still meet at the castle or Mother’s house. At first, I was afraid the purge would mean Aurelia couldn’t participate, but it was actually better for her to be seen with Mother and Florencia.</p><p>At least there were a few good things to come from the mess. First, I got to have my two new guard knights, Matthias and Laurenz, with me. Second, I got to see my cute little brother Nikolaus at the temple. Cornelius didn’t like me visiting him, but that was too bad. Little brothers were just too cute to ignore! Plus, since he was being educated in the newly-cemented temple school, he was getting to read all the picture books we made, meaning he was already well on his way to becoming a proper bookworm.</p><p>Ferdinand also ended up getting another sorely-needed attendant, though it took a lot of convincing. Janrik, Matthias’ older brother, had wanted to swear his name to me, but unlike in the temple, I couldn’t use male attendants in the castle or at the Linkberg estate. When I mentioned serving Wilfried instead, Janrik said if he couldn’t swear his name to me, then he would like to at least serve in my house. It seemed to me his motivation had less to do with the Saint-of-Ehrenfest misinformation campaign and more to do with wanting to stick to his brother.</p><p>I eventually convinced Ferdinand by winning Justus to my side. I started by appealing to the fact that he was criminally understaffed, but when that didn’t work, I eventually agreed to let Justus in my highbeast again on scheduled trips where he could bombard me with questions.</p><p>I wanted someone to appreciate me for my sacrifice, but Justus insisted he was the one actually making the sacrifice since he was going to be training Janrik. Apparently, Ferdinand wasn’t satisfied with merely adding an attendant to his entourage, so they were basically putting him through scholar bootcamp.</p><p>I didn’t see what the big deal was, though. I’d been in bootcamp ever since I met Ferdinand, and it didn’t include nearly as much reading as Janrik’s did! He was going to be in paradise while I was going to have to put up with Justus’ nagging questions while desperately trying not to crash in my highbeast. Scholar bootcamp sounded amazing.</p><p>I just hoped crossdressing wasn’t in the curriculum. Janrik had a pretty face and a slender build like his little brother, so he might’ve been able to pull it off even better than Justus with enough practice. <em>Ugh, and Ferdinand wouldn’t stop him, either. He’d just ignore it like he does with Justus. We don’t need two of them in our house!</em></p><p>
<em>Wait a second… If he makes Janrik take up his weird hobby, what’s to stop him from spreading it elsewhere? Ferdinand’s super pretty, too! If our son looks like him, and Justus gets his hands on him…</em>
</p><p>
<em>Noooooo!!!</em>
</p><p>Sadly, I couldn’t share my inner turmoil with anyone. Ferdinand would pinch my cheeks for wasting his time, Matthias and my other retainers would probably be traumatized by the thought, and it’d just give Justus ideas. Besides, I didn’t think anyone but Rihyarda even knew about Justus’ strange habit since he hadn’t displayed it to any of them before. I only knew about it because he told me about dressing up as his sister to infiltrate tea parties to gather information.</p><p>Thankfully, I didn’t have very long to dwell on that horror show. The dyeing competition was set to take place two weeks after the Autumn Baptism Ceremony. It was later than I wanted, and it would put a lot of pressure on my seamstresses, but my hands were tied by circumstance. A lot had happened in those two weeks, too. For one, Brother Egmont was “dealt with” after making some disparaging remarks about me. I didn’t really care about what he’d said, but this was the person who’d trashed my bookroom. I was glad such a dangerous criminal was off the streets.</p><p>I also finally got to meet with Tuuli again. She had apparently made me a hairpin at the end of summer, but we couldn’t arrange to meet until a few days before the dyeing competition. When she showed me the hairpin, I was surprised to see it was in the noble color of Geduldh. The focal point was three large flowers in a nice shade of red with smaller flowers trailing down from them, gradually shifting in color to a deep crimson. There were a few flowers in multiple shades of purple towards the bottom as well. It was a stunning piece but an odd one to receive at this time of year.</p><p>“It’s beautiful,” I said. “Whatever inspired you to make it?”</p><p>She grinned. “Your honorable fiancé ordered it. He wanted a hairstick that would match your dress this winter.”</p><p>I didn’t know which dress she meant since we were having several made. I’d grown quite a lot in the past year, especially in certain places thanks to the same genetics that had blessed Tuuli, so we were having to redo my entire winter wardrobe before I went back to the Royal Academy.</p><p>Nevertheless, I couldn’t turn down a gift from my sister and fiancé!</p><p>
<em>Wait… When did he see her? He better not have brought her to the temple without telling me!</em>
</p><p>Setting aside my sudden burst of jealousy, I had her put the hairstick in for me and asked Philine and Muriella what they thought.</p><p>“It’s lovely,” Philine said.</p><p>Muriella’s eyes sparkled as she put her hand on her cheek and sighed. “Ah, how romantic to have your fiancé surprise you with such a beautiful hair accessory!”</p><p>I would take that as her approval.</p><p>I thanked Tuuli for the hairpin, but when I went to pay, she said Ferdinand had already taken care of it. The gleam in her eye suggested he’d paid quite a bit extra, too.</p><p>Once Gil had walked her out, I wrote a thank you letter to Ferdinand at Muriella’s insistence and had Monika return it to its box and put it with my things to be sent to the castle.</p><p> </p><p>When we arrived at the venue for the dyeing competition, Brunhilde left to go direct the Gilberta Company in setting up the displays while I went to meet with Mother, Florencia, and Aurelia. It was my first time actually speaking with her since the wedding. As I feared, she seemed to be rather nervous, no doubt due in part to the other Ahrensbach bride being imprisoned within two weeks of arriving in Ehrenfest. She still wore her thick veil which she refused to remove under any circumstances. It was a bit off-putting given the current political climate, but I could understand her reluctance if she’d received poor treatment because of her looks her entire life.</p><p>As we sat and talked about various things, she ended up sharing a few stories about knights fighting sea creatures. This prompted me to ask if they ate a lot of seafood in Ahrensbach, and wonderfully enough, she’d brought some fish with her! She nearly killed all of my hopes and dreams, however, when she said she was going to have to dispose of them because rather than filling her time-stopping magic tool with prepared dishes, they’d stuffed it with live fish.</p><p>
<em>Oh, so it’s super fresh, too! Fish! My precious fish! I won’t let you die in vain!</em>
</p><p>My problem was that I had to find a way to convince her to give me the fish without outright asking for them. Mother and Florencia would scold me so hard in my hidden room if I messed up that badly, especially when meeting my sister-in-law for the first time.</p><p>“Sister-in-law,” I said, “I’m sure that was terribly upsetting to find raw fish when you were undoubtedly seeking comfort in the form of familiar dishes.”</p><p>“Umm… Yes, it rather was, I suppose.”</p><p>“That truly saddens my heart. However, as I have yet been unable to do anything to welcome you to Ehrenfest as Lamprecht’s little sister, may I offer the services of my personal chefs? They are quite skilled as today’s sweets will attest. I think it would be lovely for all of us to be able to share a meal as a family made with Ahrensbach fish and Ehrenfest spices to celebrate your union.” It was a risk to even mention Ahrensbach at the moment, but since I was putting emphasis on food rather than people or culture, it seemed my mother was going to let it slide.</p><p>“O-oh my, I couldn’t ask you to do that…”</p><p>I let my gaze fall. “I see. I apologize. I didn’t mean to impose.”</p><p>“Oh, not at all!” she said hurriedly. “I…I would be ever so grateful to share such a wonderful meal with you.”</p><p><em>Yes! My fish! I have saved you, my precious fish!</em> It really was fortunate that Aurelia was so desperate to please. “Wonderful,” I said, smiling brightly. “I will look forward to it, then.” We made preliminary arrangements to have the time-stopping magic tools delivered to Ferdinand’s estate where I would keep it supplied with mana until my chefs could get an opportunity to start experimenting. While I hadn’t asked him about it first, I didn’t think Ferdinand would mind too much if I told him he could use whatever we weren’t planning to eat as materials. He probably never got the opportunity to study any ingredients from the sea before, and though he would certainly lecture me, he’d keep it nice and short so as not to waste any time he could spend in his workshop instead.</p><p>When everything was ready, we got up to go view the various pieces of cloth, and I found Aurelia following me like a little duckling. Well, that was fine. Anyone who gave me fish was a friend of mine. Besides, there was a possibility she could get even more fish sent to her in the future! Really, I was doing my part in diplomatic relations here by letting her imprint on me.</p><p>As we approached the first piece of cloth, I saw a tag with a number on it but no other identifying information. Hiding my panic, I called Otto over and asked, “What is this?”</p><p>He explained that to avoid favoritism, they decided to keep the dyers and workshops anonymous. So this whole setup was to prevent me from seeing my mom’s name and picking her cloth. What was the point of having all this power if it meant I couldn’t engage in a little nepotism?!</p><p>With a sinking feeling in my chest, I walked around with Aurelia, commenting on the various pieces as we went, trying to believe the power of my love would be enough to see me through.</p><p>I came to a sudden stop in front of a particular display. It was dyed in a beautiful red that gradually shifted into a deep crimson. At the bottom were small flowers in various shades of purple.</p><p>
<em>”He wanted a hairstick that would match your dress this winter.”</em>
</p><p><em>Oh, Ferdinand…</em> I closed my eyes and brought a hand to my chest as his roundabout, hard-to-understand kindness warmed my heart. Being able to select my mom as my exclusive dyer boosted my mood so much that I had Gretia purchase the cloth Aurelia seemed to gravitate towards and send it to Lamprecht to give to his new bride.</p><p>I was going to have to do something big for Ferdinand in return. To that end, I spent all of my free time for the next several days in my workshop trying to rush along my pet project. Imagining the look on his face when I gave it to him made all the mana expenditure and lost reading time worth it.</p>

<p>It was weird being engaged. I didn’t really know what to do at first. Since Brunhilde was Rozemyne’s attendant, she wouldn’t let me escort her while she was working, which was basically all the time. Even though I sometimes saw her when I had tea with my little sisters, I didn’t get to speak with her much there, either.</p><p>Father told me to send her gifts instead, but I didn’t really know what to get her. First, I asked Rozemyne what her favorite rinsham was and got her that. She was polite with her thanks, but she didn’t seem to love it.</p><p>Next, I sent her description to the Gilberta Company to get a hairpin that would suit her, and she seemed to like that a lot, but I couldn’t just keep giving her hairpins all the time.</p><p>Finally, the perfect idea occurred to me. Since she was going to be working so hard to get the paper-making and printing industries going in Groschel, I decided to start giving her different types of stationery so she could see a variety of paper and maybe get ideas for the future. Rozemyne had said they would only teach them to make one basic kind of paper, but who knew what Brunhilde would have her people making in ten or twenty years?</p><p>At first, she didn’t seem that thrilled with it, but when I followed my sister’s advice and told her why I was giving her paper, she was really happy. Rozemyne told me to start passing her notes instead of just giving her blank paper, but I wouldn’t even know what to write.</p><p>When the purge started, we archduke candidates were basically locked down where we were, save for when we went to the temple for the Autumn Baptism. Charlotte and I only stayed at the temple for the day, but Rozemyne ended up being there for a couple of weeks. Since she didn’t take her attendants with her to the temple and Charlotte and I couldn’t move around like we normally did, we ended up having a tea party with the two of us and Brunhilde.</p><p>The girls started by talking about rinsham and fashion trends and the dyeing competition that was coming up, but I didn’t really have anything to add, so I just sat and listened while eating my mousse. It was going to be the trend Charlotte would introduce this winter since her chefs figured out how to make it look fancy after learning to make it.</p><p>“Oh my, but we’re leaving my dear brother out,” Charlotte said, covering her mouth with her hand. “I imagine all this talk of fashion is boring you to tears.”</p><p>“You two were talking about the new fabric so much that it made me wonder if it was going to be another trend you and Rozemyne were going to be spreading this year.”</p><p>Brunhilde’s eyes lit up as she smiled at me. “That would be nice if a little difficult given we all have to wear black clothing at the Academy.”</p><p>I raised my brows at her in bewilderment. “You mean even you didn’t think to use the new cloth as handkerchiefs or something?”</p><p>Her eyes widened before they narrowed in calculation. “While that’s an interesting idea, a handkerchief isn’t a handkerchief without embroidery, and we don’t have time to embroider them with the schumil’s clothing.”</p><p>“Can’t you get seamstresses to do it?”</p><p>She pursued her lips in thought, but she didn’t seem too interested in the idea.</p><p>I just shrugged in response. This was outside my area of expertise.</p><p>The conversation moved on to the trends my father said we could spread this year. I was going to do different flavored cookies, a book about knights fighting powerful feybeasts, and chess, which was pretty similar to gewinnen. After getting all the boys in my class to include their crest in their schtappes, I was also secretly hoping to come up with a really cool-looking sword this year.</p><p>In addition to mousse, Charlotte was going to share a book of romance stories and stackable hairpins while Rozemyne was going to have mille crepes, a different book of romance stories, and fancy hairpins. Everyone was going to be using Ehrenfest paper with even med- and laynobles being allowed to deduct the cost of materials from whatever they’d be paid for information and stories they gathered or books they transcribed. Apparently, with new paper-making workshops popping up all over the south thanks to Ilgner and Haldenzel’s shorter winter making the river usable longer, the cost of paper was going down, too.</p><p>By the end of the tea party, I’d seen several sides of Brunhilde that she hadn’t shown me before. Unlike when she was serving my little sister, she’d been emotional and passionate as we discussed trends, almost like Rozemyne when she was talking about books. It made me wonder what I was getting myself into once again.</p><p> </p><p>It was nearly time for the Harvest Festival before we were able to travel to Groschel. Not only did all of our retainers come but so did some of Rozemyne’s Gutenbergs. She dropped them off in the lower city to investigate the situation after giving Brunhilde time off to spend with her family. While it was nice to finally be able to fulfill my duty and escort her, I was nervous the whole time. I knew her family didn’t think highly of me.</p><p>Surprisingly enough, though, they were all very cordial. It was superficial, sure, but it was a lot better than I was expecting. Wherever it seemed like they were about to start trying to trip me up with questions I didn’t know the answer to or by hiding insults behind polite words, I’d just compliment Brunhilde, and they would drop it. I wasn’t sitting through all those tea parties with my sisters and mother for nothing!</p><p>One time, her mother started asking why I was going for knight commander rather than aub (a hidden slight even I recognized). I said, “As knight commander, I’ll be able to support Brunhilde when she becomes Giebe Groschel. With how good she is at spreading trends and gathering all sorts of information about people from other duchies, I think Groschel’s only going to flourish more under her. The city’s influence can only grow with someone like her leading it.”</p><p>When her uncle mentioned that Brunhilde’s strengths really made up for my weaknesses, I said, “You’re right. I may be getting good with physical enhancement and battle strategy, but Brunhilde’s really good with social tactics. It’s comforting to know that someone with the blessings of Anhaltung, Mestionora, and Efflorelume will be at the forefront of the political landscape as both Giebe Groschel and the wife of the knight commander.”</p><p>That one made her whole face turn red, but I didn’t see why. I knew I had made a blunder with Lady Hannelore when I mentioned Efflorelume, but this wasn’t at all the same. The goddess’ blessing was a powerful weapon when going to battle in the realm of politics.</p><p>Well, either way, I was happy when her family stopped with their sneak attacks.</p><p>After a couple of days, Rozemyne asked Groschel’s scholars for a report on the paper-making industry, and they said everything was progressing smoothly. I thought that was good news, but my little sister looked troubled. When she said that report differed from her Gutenbergs’ findings, it was Brunhilde’s turn to look troubled.</p><p>My sisters, fiancé, and I retired to another room to discuss the discrepancies in reports, and Rozemyne and Brunhilde ended up going back and forth on deciding which was more trustworthy - a noble’s word or a commoner’s. Eventually, I stepped in and said, “You’re both right toa certain degree. There are many truths, and it’s important to listen to all of them.”</p><p>“But they’re commoners,” Brunhilde protested.</p><p>“You know, that’s something I find kind of odd,” I said, resisting the urge to scratch my head. “I’ve been to a lot of provinces for Spring Prayer and a few for the Harvest Festival, but I’ve never seen another giebe’s land divided between commoners and nobles like Ehrenfest is. In Haldenzel, they even celebrate Spring Prayer together.”</p><p>“With…commoners?”</p><p>“Yeah. A giebe is supposed to work with their people, right? I mean, the aub has to worry about the whole duchy, so he’s relying on giebes to take care of the people on a local level, right?” I looked to Charlotte for confirmation since she was receiving some intensive aub education from Uncle and Bonifatius.</p><p>My little sister nodded. “I, too, have seen giebes, nobles, and commoners talking with each other and working together. Since Ehrenfest has no giebe and serves as the place where nobles from all over the duchy gather, it doesn’t function quite like that as its purpose is different. Please understand that Groschel is the exception, not the rule.”</p><p>“But…”</p><p>“Well, there’s one definite way to settle this matter,” I said, getting to my feet. “Let’s go have a look at the paper for ourselves! We won’t get anywhere just sitting around talking about it.” Brunhilde was reluctant to take the hand I offered her, but at least she was willing to come.</p><p>Since the lower city smelled so bad thanks to the entwickeln being delayed until next year, Rozemyne had her Gutenbergs meet us in the side building used by priests during Spring Prayer and the Harvest Festival. They brought with them samples of Groschel’s paper, which all of us could immediately tell was nowhere near the quality of paper made elsewhere.</p><p>“Are our commoners lacking compared to those in other provinces?” Brunhilde asked.</p><p>I felt it was a fair question. The quality of knight could change how well a strategy worked, after all. We would never get the same results sending untrained laynobles against the Lord of Winter as seasoned archknights.</p><p>Rozemyne shook her head and asked the blonde boy from the Plantin Company to explain. It turned out the water was so dirty here that it was lowering the quality of the paper.</p><p>“Do you suppose the entwickeln will correct that?” Charlotte asked.</p><p>Rozemyne shrugged. “I’m not sure. That’s probably a question for Ferdinand or Sylvester.”</p><p>“So will we be unable to make paper, then…?” Brunhilde asked, her face going pale.</p><p>“Couldn’t you just buy paper from Ilgner or one of the other provinces?” I asked. “You have smiths and carpenters in Ehrenfest training for the printing industry. Maybe you could focus on that until we figure out if creation magic can fix the river. If not, then you can just focus on printing.”</p><p>She nodded, though she didn’t look too pleased. I tried wracking my brain for another idea that could give Groschel a unique advantage while playing to Brunhilde’s strengths. “Hmm… Printing… Books… Fashion… Fabric…”</p><p>“Oh!” Rozemyne said, clapping her hands together. “What if you start printing [&amp;$*^&lt;#] books?”</p><p>“What’s that now?” I asked.</p><p>“Oh, umm, very thin books about fashion trends for the season. You could gather information about fashion trends then hire an artist to draw pictures to accompany descriptions.”</p><p>“What a wonderful idea!” Brunhilde exclaimed.</p><p>“What about special covers, too?” Charlotte added. “You could use one of the most popular styles for fabric for the fashion book each year.”</p><p>“If we place a bigger emphasis on Ehrenfest fashion combined with the fabric, it would be a powerful tool for spreading our trends. Lady Rozemyne, is there any way we could get a few of these books printed before we start back to the Academy?”</p><p>She tilted her head, pressing a finger against her cheek. “It’ll be tight, but if we only do a handful… We will only be able to do a few styles. If I get my personal artist along with Mother’s…”</p><p>They got lost in planning while I sat back with a smile, patting my back for a job well done. I may not have come up with the ideas myself, but I had helped spark them, so I was satisfied with my contribution.</p><p>When they finished, I crossed my arms and raised a brow at Brunhilde. “You know, your lady would be disappointed if I gave you the idea to check on the paper yourself and to buy paper from elsewhere for free.”</p><p>She narrowed her eyes. “What do you want?”</p><p>I grinned. “Come with me for this year’s Harvest Festival so you can see what we mean about giebes working with commoners.”</p><p>“What?!”</p><p>Rozemyne tilted her head. “I think that’s a good idea. It’ll only be a few days. You can return here after that to talk with Giebe Groschel about what you’ve observed. Wilfried won’t have to leave for another five days, so why don’t you spend that time getting descriptions together for the fashion book to send to the artists?”</p><p>And so it was decided that she would attend the Harvest Festival with me. She was really uncomfortable at first, but by the time we got to our fourth destination, she had relaxed enough to start talking with the commoners, not just the giebes and nobles. She wasn’t going to change overnight, but she was making an effort to do better for her people and to make the duchy business a success.</p><p>She may have been a bit emotional and passionate about her hobbies, but seeing this side of her eased a lot of my anxiety. I didn’t mind what I was getting myself into so much anymore.</p>

<p>Ferdinand was livid. He had just spent the past few weeks running himself ragged rounding up Georgine sympathizers and dealing with the nightmarish political consequences, and then he received an ordonnanz from Lasfam stating Rozemyne had sent some time-stopping magic tools to his estate without even mentioning it to him first. Without even going to inspect them, he knew what was inside since the dyeing competition had just wrapped up.</p><p>Despite being on the verge of death from how busy he was, he went to his estate where he stood before the fish-filled tools with a deep frown. Did that girl think his estate was her personal storage building? If this was how she acted as a fiancé, what sort of nonsense would he have to deal with once they were married?</p><p>Rather than wait until after the Harvest Festival to get his revenge by pinching her cheeks, he had the tools taken to the library and lined up in front of the shelves she was currently reading her way through. He spent a few moments considering if she would take back her offer of letting him have the materials from the fish, but he dismissed the notion. He already had them from the first weave, after all, and she needed to learn a lesson.</p><p>That taken care of, Ferdinand went back to the temple where he continued working out the schedule for the Harvest Festival. They had several new blue priests thanks to the purge, but due to their age, emotional state, and lack of experience, he couldn’t send them out by themselves, nor could he keep them in the temple when the Harvest Festival would play an important role in their winter preparations. The established blue priests would not take kindly to having to split their share with children, and increasing the number of towns they each went to would make some of them even more irate.</p><p>“Good grief,” Ferdinand sighed, rubbing his temples. He was not looking forward to all the trouble the blue priests were about to cause him.</p><p>To his surprise, though, none of them spoke a word of complaint when he gave out the schedules. Apparently, Egmont’s recent demise had put a few things into perspective for them. At least the man had finally proven of some use.</p><p>The day before winter socializing began, Rozemyne came to Ferdinand’s estate with her winter song and recipe. As he reviewed them, his ears warmed. She was not so socially incompetent now that she wouldn’t understand the implications of poached raffles, and her song of Geduldh longing for the warmth Ewigeliebe had shown before the Goddess of Chaos had corrupted his love paralleled thematically and musically to the song she’d forbidden him to perform in front of other women so well that her intent for them to play them together in the future was obvious. He didn’t know if he could survive listening to her sing as Geduldh pleading for Ewigeliebe to embrace her as he used to.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, he dismissed her, and she immediately bounded off to the library as he pulled out his harspiel to begin playing through the new piece. A moment later, an outraged cry rang throughout the house before Rozemyne was suddenly in front of him, having used enhancement magic to increase her speed.</p><p>“How could you?!” she asked. “To desecrate my library by blocking my path to its books like that is unforgivable!”</p><p>“I believe you mean <em>my</em> library,” Ferdinand shot back with a smug smirk. “If you choose to use my estate as your personal storage facility, I see no harm in putting the items you wish to keep in the room you use the most.”</p><p>“Fine! Then you can’t have the materials from the fish that you’ll likely never get any other way!”</p><p>“Ah, then you will not need my assistance fighting and dissecting them.”</p><p>They glared at each other for several long moments before she relented. “If I didn’t want to eat fish so badly, I’d really be letting you have it right now.”</p><p>“How fortunate for me that you are as shortsighted in the pursuit of your goals as ever,” he said. “Perhaps you can start on a different shelf. I will need time to find a place to store the time-stopping magic tools where you can refill them with mana and they’ll be out of the way.”</p><p>“Ngh…! Fine.”</p><p>From behind him, Ferdinand heard Janrik ask Justus in a bewildered voice if this sort of interaction was normal only for Justus to clap a hand over his mouth as he tried desperately not to laugh.</p><p>The next day after he and Rozemyne performed the winter debut and they’d changed, he escorted her back into the grand hall. Her red dress was similar to last weave, though the top portion was designed to accommodate her quickly developing blessings of Anwachs. Her hairpin differed, too, since Tuuli had made it to perfectly match the dyed fabric rather than complement it. His robes, at Rozemyne’s, Elvira’s, and Florencia’s insistence, were dyed in a similar gradient to her dress, though without the flowers and pops of purple. It felt odd not wearing something in his usual shades of green for his birth season, and the looks they drew upon entering did nothing to assuage his discomfort.</p><p>He did feel a little better, however, when he witnessed Rozemyne’s anxiety at receiving the highest form of gratitude from Giebe Haldenzel for bringing spring early. This year, there were no outright enemies to defend her from since the purge had happened earlier and was far more thorough, but both she and Ferdinand had to verbally spar against the Leisegangs who’d yet to give up on one of them taking the seat of aub.</p><p>When it came time for the students to depart, Ferdinand gave Rozemyne, Wilfried, and Charlotte a list of warnings, not that he expected it to do much good. Sure enough, his doubts were proven justified once they received reports from the advancement ceremony and fellowship gathering. First, Eglantine was made a professor. Second, Anastasius was the royal representative this year, not Hildebrand, though that could have been just as much a blessing as a curse. Either way, Hartmut’s report only raised more concerns.</p><p>
<em>Lord Ferdinand,</em>
</p><p>
<em>Once again, our goddess’ grace and divinity drew the eyes of all as she glided across the hall. When she went to greet Prince Anastasius, however, he was blinded by his own utter lack of perception.</em>
</p><p>
<em>His words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“I see Ehrenfest has clawed its way to tenth, due in no small part to the Saint of Ehrenfest’s efforts.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Our goddess’ words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“I thank you ever so much for the praise, but it was a joint effort of all students. One of the pillar gods’ actions alone is not enough to exalt all five.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>His words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“It seems the gods have taken many actions in regards to you. Tell me, are you certain you’re not at least a year older than you claim? You do not have the same youthful appearance as others in your grade.”</em>
</p><p>And there was the first hint of suspicion. Ferdinand hadn’t seen much of Tuuli in the previous weave, so he was unable to witness just how quickly the girl had matured. Both girls were already early bloomers, and Rozemyne was pretending to be a year younger than she was. Overall, he didn’t think her early puberty would matter much in the grand scheme of things, but it was just another concern to add to his mountain of worries.</p><p>
<em>Her words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“I am ever so humbled by your praise once again, but I assure you that I was baptized and adopted by the archduke on the same day in summer four years hence. Incidentally, may I introduce you to our dear little sister, Charlotte, who is starting at the academy this year?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>His words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Ah, the one who’s currently favored to become aub.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Lady Charlotte, a truly kindred spirit’s words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Indeed, and if I may be forgiven for saying so, my older sister’s appearance is merely another sign of her abundant blessings from the gods. She was baptized the year before my debut, and yet she was so small that one might question whether she was old enough to be baptized even then. On that fateful night when Chaocipher struck our duchy, she was forced to endure a year in a jureve for my sake. Though all thought it impossible, she enjoyed the blessing of Anwachs.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>His words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“You seem to enjoy many blessings from the gods.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Charlotte’s words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Indeed she does.”</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand rubbed his temples. He could have done without them continually pointing out how special Rozemyne was. It was only a matter of time before the royal family moved on her, and this sort of praise would only hasten that day.</p><p>Hartmut went on to describe how Klassenberg tried to emphasize ties with Rozemyne through her “friendship” with Eglantine, how Rozemyne had taken a gratuitous amount of time discussing books and the library with Lady Hannelore, Drewanchel’s apparent success at recreating rinsham and Adolphine’s interest in inviting not only Rozemyne but Charlotte to future tea parties, and the benign interactions with the fourth- and fifth-ranked duchies.</p><p>Ahrensbach was as troublesome as ever.</p><p>
<em>Lady Detlinde once again spent an inordinate amount of time addressing Wilfried and ignoring our goddess.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Her words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“My dear cousin Wilfried, I was so sad that I did not get a chance to speak with you properly at the wedding, nor you, cousin Charlotte.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>His words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Indeed. However, as we were there partially to support our sister Rozemyne–”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Her words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Yes, yes, we all saw her mediocre blessing. Really, for a so-called saint, we had expected more. It truly is a shame a temple-raised child has forced two outstanding archduke candidates to sully themselves with temple work, but I suppose that much is necessary to support one such as her.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>His words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“We have not been forced but rather gladly offer our–”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Her words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“And to think you are forced to pretend to be happy about it. Well, I would expect nothing less of a duchy so eager to prop up a temple-raised child. Incidentally, how are the Ahrensbach brides? We have been so worried, haven’t we, Martina?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Martina’s words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Indeed. I have worried for my sister Aurelia so. We haven’t received word from her, and all communication from Lady Bettina was lost within two weeks of her arrival in Ehrenfest.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Deltinde’s words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“I trust nothing is amiss?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Charlotte’s words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Fear not. Aurelia is doing well. We recently saw her at a tea party in the castle where she expressed her happiness with her marriage being approved.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Wilfried’s words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Our apologies, but Dregarnuhr has woven swiftly. We cannot ask others who are so eager to greet you to wait any longer.”</em>
</p><p>“Ahrensbach hasn’t heard about the purge yet,” Ferdinand told Sylvester and Karstedt. “Or at least, they’re searching for more information on it.”</p><p>“If we’re lucky, Georgine won’t get anything concrete before the archduke conference,” Sylvester said. “That’s a conversation I don’t want to deal with…”</p><p>The next troublesome report was from Philine who stated Fraularm was calling Ehrenfest’s integrity into question after they passed one of their written exams on the first day with such high marks. Fortunately, even without Hirschur’s presence, the other professors were quick to dismiss her claims and pass the students. Ferdinand, Sylvester, and Karstedt agreed that without any proof on Fraularm’s part, it was unlikely that any of her false accusations would cause any lasting harm and may in fact work against her.</p><p>The next letter Ferdinand received from Rozemyne was full of gushing praise for the two new librarians, Arnfried and Isolde, archnobles from Klassenberg. Hartmut was able to find out that they were both related to people in Eglantine’s entourage. Neither was married as they were both fully dedicated to their crafts, painting and harspiel, respectively. They left their duchy for the Sovereignty more to follow their family members than anything else, but they were happy to take the oath to Mestionora in hopes of expanding the library’s resources related to their passions. It was no wonder Rozemyne was so enamored with them. The third librarian had yet to appear, however, so Eglantine was likely still negotiating with whichever duchy she planned to steal an archnoble from.</p><p>The innocuous news from the Academy could not continue, however, with Rozemyne in attendance. Her and Wilfried’s reports on their schtappe class caused all three men to raise their eyebrows in shock.</p><p>
<em>To my dear fiancé who desecrates libraries,</em>
</p><p>“What’s that about?” Sylvester asked between snorts of laughter.</p><p>Ferdinand ignored him and continued reading.</p><p>
<em>Today, we learned to make shields and weapons. A lot of the other archduke candidates didn’t seem to get the importance of learning these techniques, but sweet Hannelore, Wilfried, and I certainly did. I hope she didn’t experience anything like what occurred in the castle after Charlotte’s debut.</em>
</p><p>
<em>The shield was a little difficult for me and Wilfried because the rectangle they wanted us to produce didn’t match Schutzaria’s round shield which we’re both more familiar with. They gave me permission to stick with the round shield since I won’t be doing the knight course, but when Professor Rauffen tested it by throwing a feystone at me, one of your protective charms went off. It was fortunate he was so quick to react, or I could have gotten in a lot of trouble for attacking a professor! Can I remove my charms for practical lessons at least? I don’t want to cause an incident in the future.</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand was loath to grant his permission, but he begrudgingly did so at Sylvester and Karstedt’s nagging.</p><p>
<em>Anyway, Wilfried was able to make the circular shield, but since he’s going to take the knight course, he has to focus on making it rectangular. The magic circle on the divine instrument is much more powerful than the one they showed us in class, so he’s working on incorporating it on the knight-approved shield.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Weapons were next, and Wilfried caused quite a stir by producing Ewigeliebe’s sword. When he told everyone it was because he was a priest in the temple and dedicated mana and prayers to the gods, they made me make one, too. We also both produced Leidenschaft’s spear. This caused a lot of questioning from Rauffen but not much else.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Anyway, I passed on the first day. One step closer to the library!</em>
</p><p>
<em>– Rozemyne</em>
</p><p>“Oh, she’s definitely leaving something out,” Sylvester said, and Karstedt nodded in agreement.</p><p>Fairly certain of what that something was, Ferdinand looked at Wilfried’s report.</p><p>
<em>Uncle,</em>
</p><p>
<em>In class today, we had to make a shield and a weapon. Rozemyne and I were able to make Schutzaria’s shield, but I have to make mine a rectangle, so it’s going to take some work before I pass this class. It’s hard to imagine since I’ve given so much mana to the divine instruments. It’s like the image is imprinted on my brain or something.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Everyone thought it was really cool when I made Ewigeliebe’s sword, and when I filled it with mana, it looked like a little blizzard was starting to swirl around it. Professor Rauffen made me dismiss it before I could see what it did, though. He made Rozemyne form the sword, too. We both made Leidenschaft’s spear, but hers was crackling with so much mana that she was immediately told to revert her schtappe.</em>
</p><p>
<em>We told the professors that we could make the divine instruments because we were both part of the temple and offered our prayers and mana to the gods so often, and some of our classmates were disgusted. I don’t really understand why since our offerings make the harvests better, and you get to make divine instruments with your schtappe. Some of them seemed interested, though, so at least some people weren’t looking at us like we were gruns.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rozemyne did something really crazy next. While I was trying to figure out the whole shield thing, she made a weird weapon that she could hold in one hand, and Professor Rauffen went nuts, saying it would completely change warfare. She said it was just a toy, and when she used it, it made a little stream of mana. I told her that you would still want to hear about it, even if it were a toy because she basically just created something brand new.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Well, after we got back to the dorm, she tore several holes through one of the tapestries on the wall in the common room, but at least the stone itself wasn’t damaged. She said she was just thinking about how you fired several arrows at once with a bow, and it just sort of happened.”</em>
</p><p>“What?!” Karstedt cried as he leapt to his feet while Sylvester cradled his head. “She created an entirely new spell, and it’s a one-handed bow?!”</p><p>Sylvester cradled his head in his hands and said, “We should just be grateful she didn’t fire off the arrows in class. Who knows what we’d have to deal with then?”</p><p>A mild headache began pounding behind Ferdinand’s eyes. Originally, she’d only discovered its function as a weapon when she was alone, and then she’d only shown it to her retainers after that, at least until the ternisbefallen attack. Allowing other Ehrenfest students to witness it probably wouldn’t have dire consequences, but he disliked the uncertainty he felt.</p><p>
<em>It’s a good weapon for her since she should be able to use it from her highbeast, but none of us could reproduce it. I don’t think anyone below archknight could use it, anyway, since it requires a lot of mana. We’re going to take her out to the gathering spot tomorrow to see how strong it actually is. We’ll update you on what we discover.</em>
</p><p>
<em>–Wilfried</em>
</p><p>The next day, they found it was powerful enough to take down a feybeast of middling strength in one shot, making it more powerful than it had been in the previous weave, undoubtedly due to her extra compression and lack of mana blockages.</p><p>Karstedt was beside himself, practically foaming at the mouth to witness it while Sylvester bemoaned his fate should anyone else discover her new invention. Meanwhile, Ferdinand wrote a rather stern letter to Rozemyne chastising her for failing to report the most important event during her schtappe-morphing class or the experiment the following morning. He ordered her to keep the new weapon a secret while explaining the myriad problems that could surface should she fail to heed his warning.</p><p>The students continued to blaze through their work thanks to all the materials Rozemyne had made as well as the increased rigor of the winter playroom, though not all the first years passed on their first day. Meanwhile, Ferdinand worked with Elvira to try to quell the surge of enthusiasm the Leisegangs were enjoying after the purge. They were no longer calling for either him or Rozemyne to take the seat of aub, but they seemed to think they now wielded power over Sylvester.</p><p>They wanted heavier taxes placed on those provinces allied with the former Veronica faction as punishment for the treatment they’d received, direct descendants of Leisegangs to fill the recently-vacated giebe positions, and a plethora of other ridiculous demands. The majority of the affected provinces would go to mostly ostensibly neutral nobles, such as the former Viscount Dahldolf’s son who’d sworn his name to Sylvester. As for the higher taxes, Sylvester more or less told them to be satisfied with their increased harvests thanks to members of the archduke family joining the temple to provide mana to their lands.</p><p>At least there was some good news from the Academy for a change. Rozemyne, Wilfried, and their retainers that had trained under Ferdinand had sped through brewing recovery potions, though only Rozemyne used the time-saving magic circle when making hers. Apparently, these low-grade potions were proving to be a valuable source of income for Philine, so Roderick was working feverishly to learn to make them, too. While that had lifted Sylvester’s spirits, the report from the dedication whirl class had boosted Ferdinand’s.</p><p>Drewanchel had approached Rozemyne, Wilfried, and Charlotte during the break, and just before they parted, Wilfried had noticed Detlinde and Rudiger waiting to pounce, so he acted on impulse and pulled Hannelore into the conversation under the pretense of introducing her to Charlotte. Rozemyne’s book obsession took care of things from there, so Detlinde was never afforded the opportunity to speak with them. After that clumsy attempt to probe for information during the fellowship gathering, Ferdinand wanted them to stay as far away from Ahrensbach as possible, with the exception of Raymund who was providing intelligence in exchange for his guidance. The boy would make a decent retainer in a few years.</p><p>The next major development came after the divine protections ritual where Gretia, Laurenz, and Muriella were all found to be omnielemental. Hirschur had managed to keep the event under wraps, but she immediately wrote to Ferdinand demanding answers. Were it nearly anyone else, he might have been able to deflect by suggesting it a natural consequence of serving one so dedicated to the gods that she was able to reproduce divine instruments, but Hirschur would immediately point out the flaws in that theory. Instead, he said it might have something to do with how Rozemyne’s retainers were visiting the temple so often and that he’d look into it more at a later date. This didn’t satisfy her, but it at least delayed the problem of having to deal with her.</p><p>Meanwhile, Sylvester and Karstedt minds boggled at the news, wondering how Rozemyne’s influence had allowed mednobles to gain elements they hadn’t had at their baptism. Ferdinand offered no answers.</p><p>An utterly baffling report came from Rozemyne’s musician via Philine. They’d attended a tea party with the music professors, and when they asked to hear one of Rozemyne’s original compositions, Rosina tried to quietly mention a song Rozemyne had written the lyrics to herself only to be overheard by one of the sharp-eared professors. She was pressured into playing it, and it was such that both Rosina and Philine implored him to ask Rozemyne about it when she returned. Naturally, Rozemyne made no report of the incident, only stating the tea party was pleasant, and everyone enjoyed her musician’s playing.</p><p><em>Now what song could this be?</em> he wondered. It was obviously one she hadn’t shared with him before, or she wouldn’t have gone out of her way to not mention it in her letter to him. His curiosity nearly drove him to have her return home sooner, but she would only lash out at being torn from the library too soon, thus ensuring he’d never hear the piece.</p><p>Peace was ever ephemeral, however. The next headache-inducing report came shortly on the heels of the baffling one, stating how Prince Anastasius had opted to attend the changing of Schwartz and Weiss. Hartmut’s letter was as thorough as ever, unlike Rozemyne’s.</p><p>
<em>My lord,</em>
</p><p>
<em>It truly is a marvel to see how our goddess shines when in her preferred environment! Her radiance as she directed all those around her in dressing the two shumils was a sight to behold!</em>
</p><p>
<em>Alas, a dark cloud came in an attempt to diminish her brilliance. The prince appeared seemingly by happenstance, though this lie was as obvious as what Ewigeliebe wants. As the dressing of the shumils continued, he asked why one of the arch librarians had not been made their master. My lady deigned to explain to the obtuse prince in language he could understand that not only would they have to pour in more mana than she had, but they would have to provide new clothing that neither of them had the time to prepare. The librarians, recognizing her words for what they were, added that they were grateful for the library committee’s contributions of mana to the shumils as it allowed them to focus on other tools that needed to be reactivated and maintained.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Once again, however, our goddess extended her grace to him, asking if he would like to take ownership as a member of royalty, which he of course denied. It seems his cape only extends so far.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Throughout the conversation, his gaze kept wandering toward the reading room, so extending her mercy to him that he might seek his true goal without bringing shame upon himself, our goddess asked if he would prefer to go as he no doubt originally intended and read, but he failed to grasp the magnanimous gesture and instead opted to stay, though I cannot place too much blame upon him as her presence is one difficult to abandon.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Either way, I believe we both know what he was truly hoping to find at the library, or rather “who.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>When the shumils were at last changed, Rozemyne offered to him the clothes from their previous master. He responded thusly:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“I would not like to accept such filthy clothing. Have it cleaned then arrange a time to deliver it to me at my villa.”</em>
</p><p>“What the hell does he want with her now?” Ferdinand growled.</p><p>“What’s that?” Sylvester asked, looking up from Hirschur’s weekly report.</p><p>Ferdinand gave him a quick summary of the letter thus far, feeling a spark of satisfaction when Sylvester, too, became physically pained by the prince’s invitation.</p><p>“I know that gremlin isn’t actively seeking out all this trouble, but if she isn’t the incarnation of Glucklitat, then I don’t know what she is!”</p><p>Ferdinand was currently feeling the same way.</p><p>
<em>My lady deftly avoided his thinly veiled invitation by stating:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“My deepest apologies, Prince Anastasius. I wouldn’t dream of asking Dregarnuhr to weave so much of her tapestry for a task such as this. Please allow me but a moment.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>She then had Gretia cast waschen on the clothes and offered them to him once again. This time, one of his retainers accepted the garments.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I am afraid to report that the prince was displeased with the response, and he left soon after. We are uncertain if he will outright summon her at a later date.</em>
</p><p>
<em>—Hartmut </em>
</p><p>Rozemyne’s report, in contrast, left much to be desired.</p><p>
<em>To my fiancé,</em>
</p><p>
<em>We changed Schwartz and Weiss today. Everyone was having a great time, but then Prince Anastasius showed up and ruined the mood. He just sort of stood there being grumpy and then demanded I hand ownership over to Professor Arnfried or Professor Isolde, which troubled them greatly since they’re busy trying to get library up and running again as it used to, and they don’t have the time to prepare clothes or the mana to dedicate to taking over the shumils at the moment.</em>
</p><p>
<em>He tried to refuse their old clothes and get me to bring them to his villa later, but Mother warned me about such tactics. I was able to get him to accept them before we left.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I don’t even know why he was watching us change them when he so obviously wanted to go read. I guess he was putting his duty before his lust for books. I may not like him much, but I can appreciate the resolve that took.</em>
</p><p>
<em>—Rozemyne</em>
</p><p>Since the prince had so obviously been looking for Eglantine, Ferdinand assumed he likely wanted to talk to Rozemyne about her again, meaning she was soon to receive an invitation to tea. He didn’t have long to ponder it, however, as his mental faculties were required to respond to Rozemyne’s next letter.</p><p>
<em>Ferdinand,</em>
</p><p>
<em>Something strange happened when I went to the library with the first years to register them, and I waited until I could speak with the librarians about it in relative privacy, but Professor Solange wasn’t sure since she’s a mednoble and was unaware of many of the workings of the library, and Professors Arnfried and Isolde hadn’t had a chance to go through all the old materials from the previous arch librarians.</em>
</p><p>
<em>The shumils had taken me upstairs and asked me to dedicate mana to the Grutrissheit the statue of Mestionora was holding since it was apparently part of my job as their owner. It took a lot of my mana all at once, but nothing seemed to happen. Schwartz and Weiss just said that “Gramps” was happy, but they wouldn’t elaborate further.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Who or what is Gramps?</em>
</p><p>
<em>—Rozemyne</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand wrote and rewrote half a dozen replies before he gave up and sent her the following message:</p><p>
<em>Rozemyne,</em>
</p><p>
<em>We’ll discuss this when you return for the Dedication Ritual. Don’t speak of this to anyone else.</em>
</p><p>
<em>—Ferdinand </em>

<h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
<p>I waved to the apprentice knights as they left to go gather for their classes. Matthias, one of Rozemyne’s retainers, had discovered a new method for getting better feystones - killing a weak feybeast, feeding its feystone to another feybeast, and killing its evolved form before it got used to its new body. Lots of the lay- and mednobles were excited to go try it out.</p><p>I was staying behind to try to figure out how to make Schutzaria’s shield rectangular. Rozemyne came over after the third time I summoned a round shield and asked, “Would it help if you had a drawing to look at?”</p><p>I shrugged. “Maybe. Couldn’t hurt.”</p><p>She summoned her musician, Rosina, and one of her guard knights, Leonore. After having Leonore summon a shield, she had Rosina draw it for me on some plant paper. I added the magic circle to the center of it and stared at it, trying to commit it to memory.</p><p>After a while, I said, “Alright, I think I got it.” I chanted the spell, and on my arm was the shield from the drawing. The room burst into cheers for me with even Rozemyne looking up from her book to congratulate me. I’d been working on trying to make the right shield for knights every day since the schtappe-morphing lesson, and everyone had seen me struggling with it at one point or another, so their praise filled me with so much joy that it was going to pour out of my ears. When I caught Brunhilde’s smile, I was certain my happiness would flood the common room.</p><p>Just as things started to die back down, an ordonnanz flew through the window and landed on Rozemyne’s arm.</p><p>“This is Matthias. A ternisbefallen is attacking the gathering site. We request all available knights to help lead it away.”</p><p>All the apprentice knights were on their feet, including me, before it even started its second repeat. Leonore brought everyone to a halt, though, as she explained with a pale face that a ternisbefallen absorbed mana, meaning none of our attacks would work.</p><p>As Rozemyne commanded one of her scholars to contact Professor Hirschur and Professor Rauffen, I ran out the door with the other apprentice knights and mounted my highbeast before blasting towards the gathering spot. Alexis shouted at me, reminding me that my higher mana quantity was letting me outstrip some of my retainers, so I forced myself to slow down.</p><p>A black trail of death and decay led from somewhere across the academy straight to our gathering spot, almost as if it’d been directed there by someone. My first thought was Ahrensbach, but to be honest, I didn’t think Detlinde was smart enough to pull it off. Then again, who knew what her retainers were capable of?</p><p>As we crossed the barrier, Matthias’ voice nearly made me freeze in shock.</p><p>“TRAUGOTT! STOP!”</p><p>In moments, we had reached the battle, and most of the students were high in the air. It was obvious they’d been darting in and out to bait it into following them from the gathering spot, but now nearly all of them were flying up in the air out of reach. Traugott, however, had filled his sword with mana and slammed it into the ternisbefallen. With a roar, it began to grow before our eyes, nearly doubling in size within moments.</p><p>We all flew up higher to get out of its increased range, and by the time we came to a stop, it was too late. Traugott had thrown yet another attack at it. “DAMN IT, TRAUGOTT!” Laurenz shouted. “Did you not just see what your attack did?!”</p><p>The heat of the battle and fear of the enemy had driven Traugott to battle blindness. He couldn’t think anymore; his mind would only let him attack what was directly in front of him.</p><p>I started to yell at him, but my words died as I saw him pull out a couple of feystones and throw them at the ternisbefallen. My blood ran cold as the feybeast snapped them up and grew to monstrous proportions.</p><p>Almost without thinking, I flew at top speed towards him, whipping out my schtappe and calling forth bands of light. He was turned away from me, and despite whatever he’d done to give himself an insane mana boost over the past year, he still was no match for an archduke candidate with nearly a year of Rozemyne’s compression method under his belt. I snagged him in the ropes and yanked him away from where the ternisbefallen was rampaging. “Alexis!” I barked.</p><p>My guard knight leapt into action, grabbing the screaming Traugott with his own bands of light.</p><p>“Take him back to the dorms!” I ordered. I called forth an ordonnanz and said, “Ignaz, send an emergency message to Ehrenfest. The Knight’s Order needs to be ready immediately to receive a traitor from the transportation circle.”</p><p>As I spun to return to the battle, movement from the direction of the dormitory caught my eye, and I cursed. When my little sister arrived, I flew over and banged my fist against her highbeast. “Damn it, Rozemyne! Why the hell did you come out here?!”</p><p>Leonore and Corenelius grimaced as if to say, “We did everything except physically tie her down.” Well, they should have brought out the ropes! Better that than a dead archduke candidate!</p><p>She was staring at the ternisbefallen with horror. “H-how…?”</p><p>“We can talk later! Go back to the dorm!”</p><p>Meanwhile, Leonore was yelling about its eyes glowing in multiple colors, which was a bad sign since it meant it was super powerful now with all that mana Traugott had fed it. I didn’t see the point in going on about its eyes. The thing was the size of a building, and it was rampaging through our gathering spot.</p><p>While I tried to convince my sister to stop being stupid, Matthias was calling out orders. “Lay- and medknights, fall back! Archknights and those with higher mana, keep leading it this way!” It was a good call. The weaker knights weren’t fast enough to avoid being eaten by the monster.</p><p>“Leonore, Cornelius, go help!” Rozemyne ordered. “I’ll keep Judith and Hartmut with me!” Then, she turned to me and said, “Let’s go up!” With that, she shot straight towards the sky, leaving me no choice but to follow if I wanted to ensure she stayed alive.</p><p>When we came to a stop, she all but threw a sound-blocking tool at me. “This is just like a trombe,” she said. “The only way to take it down is with darkness-imbued weapons.”</p><p>“None of us know how to make those, or we’d already have done it!” I shouted.</p><p>“There’s a prayer in the High Bishop’s bible that will grant the God of Darkness’ blessing, but Ferdinand told me never to use it on weapons. It’s too much like a spell only adult knights of certain duchies are allowed to use.”</p><p>“Then why are we having this conversation if we can’t use it on wea–” My mind came to a halt as I understood what she was saying. “We can’t use the God of Darkness’ blessing on weapons, but we can use his cape!” I gasped.</p><p>She nodded. With that decided, I tossed her back the tool, which she nearly dropped, and waited for her to kick Judith and Hartmut out of her highbeast. Together, we each summoned the God of Darkness’ cape, and she spoke the really, really long prayer that imbued them with his attribute.</p><p>“So what do we do with this?” I asked. “Just drape it over the thing?”</p><p>“That’s the plan,” she said before zooming off, the cape fluttering in the wind as she held it out the window. I followed after, and together, we came just above it. It looked at us as soon as we stopped, so I dropped the cloak, covering its eyes, causing it to thrash about. Rozemyne threw hers over its nose just as it was taking a blind leap towards us.</p><p>“Rozemyne!”</p><p>“Wilfried!”</p><p>A couple dozen cries of shock went up as I poured mana into my highbeast and rammed into Rozemyne’s, knocking us both out of the way just in time. If it had been able to see, it would have gotten us for sure.</p><p>At least the capes were having an effect. It was gradually shrinking, though it would take bells for it to get to a reasonable size.</p><p>“It’s a shame,” Rozemyne sighed. “I bet it’d make some great materials all pumped up like this.”</p><p>“Really?!” I asked, incredulous. “Is now really the time?”</p><p>“Hey, I have to make a super high-quality proposal stone in the future!” she snapped. “You should be looking for one, too, you know! Brunhilde has six attributes, so it’s not going to be easy for you, either!”</p><p>I looked down at the flailing ternisbefallen with a deepening frown. She was right. Still, there was nothing we could do about it.</p><p>The feybeast finally managed to get Rozemyne’s cape off its nose, though it was still struggling with mine. It seemed like it was actually sticking to its eyes. Maybe the cape was just hungry for all that mana? I didn’t really know or care. What I cared about was the damage it was wreaking on our gathering spot. It’d just crossed the barrier when we threw our capes on it, but when it leapt for us, it ended up landing on the edge of the circle, withering everything around it. There was no way any of us were going to pass our brewing lessons next year.</p><p>“Oh!” Rozemyne called. “The professors are coming! Hurry, we need to get our schtappes before they see!”</p><p>“No! We can’t go down there! We’ll die! And then Uncle will kill us!”</p><p>“Ngh…!” she gripped her highbeast’s wheel so hard her knuckles turned white. “Okay, so as soon as they take it down, we’ll grab the capes, dispel the blessing, and immediately revert them back to schtappes. We have to make it look like the darkness attribute is coming from the divine instrument itself, not the blessing.”</p><p>“Got it!”</p><p>While Professor Hirschur sent off an ordonnanz, Rauffen started guiding the students away from the feybeast. It wasn’t much longer before the Sovereign Knight’s Order showed up, and by then, it’d finally knocked my cape off its face, too. Rozemyne and I hovered just out of reach until the moment the ternisbefallen fell. Then, we darted down and retrieved our schtappes, removing the blessing and reverting its shape in the same breath. The plants under where the cape had fallen were just as dead as those touched by the ternisbefallen, but I didn’t think anyone would notice given the circumstances.</p><p>With deep resignation, I drank a “kindness-infused” potion and clapped a hand over my mouth to keep from getting sick. It was at least a relief to feel my mana coming back.</p><p>We were all called over by the professors and captain of the Sovereign Knight’s Order for questioning. Professor Rauffen asked us to explain what happened, and Matthias stepped forward as the one who’d taken the lead when the attack happened.</p><p>“We were gathering materials when the ternisbefallen attacked. It seemed to appear out of nowhere, and it was killing everything it touched.”</p><p>“How’d it get so large?” Professor Hirschur asked.</p><p>“Most of the apprentice knights weren’t aware of what kind of feybeast it was and launched several attacks against it.”</p><p>I crossed my arms and nodded along with the rest of the students. We didn’t want to publicize that everything resulted from the actions of a lone traitor, at least not until Father got to weigh in. I wasn’t the most politically savvy, but even I knew that telling them everything could make us look suspicious.</p><p>“Oh ho?” Professor Hirschur asked, adjusting her monocle. “And how did you know what it was, Matthias?”</p><p>“I’ve been studying Leonore’s notes on feybeasts since last year,” he said.</p><p>At the mention of her name, she stepped forward and explained, “At Lady Rozemyne’s behest, I began studying the weaknesses of feybeasts that commonly appear in speed ditter. I found the topic interesting, so I continued to study other feybeasts as well. I learned about ternisbefallens from a scroll in the library last year.”</p><p>Professor Rauffen nodded his appreciation of her dedication but then turned his intense gaze on me and Rozemyne. “What was with the black cloth? It looked like you two made it with your schtappes.”</p><p>“Yes, it was the God of Darkness’ cape,” I said.</p><p>“What?!” he shouted. “So it’s not just the shield, sword, and lance you can make?!”</p><p>Rozemyne tilted her head and put her hand on her cheek. “I’m High Bishop, and my brother is a priest. Naturally, we can make all the divine instruments.”</p><p>“All of them?!” Professor Rauffen cried as Professor Hirschur and the knight commander raised their brows.</p><p>“Produce these capes,” the knight commander ordered.</p><p>After exchanging looks, Rozemyne and I summoned our schtappes and transformed them into the God of Darkness’ cape. He then made us lay them on the ground, and my stomach sank. He’d figured out we were draining the mana from the ternisbefallen, and without the darkness blessing, our capes wouldn’t do what he was expecting. He was going to find out about the prayer Rozemyne wasn’t supposed to use.</p><p>At his command, we lifted the cloaks, and praise be to the gods, the grass had withered! It wasn’t nearly as pronounced as with the blessing; there was still some vegetation left, but at least we didn’t look like liars.</p><p>“Why did the ternisbefallen come straight to the Ehrenfest gathering spot?” the commander asked.</p><p>I shrugged as Matthias answered, “We don’t know. We were only gathering as we normally do. There was nothing special about what we did today that would have called a feybeast like that to us.”</p><p><em>Except bring Traugott,</em> I thought. I didn’t know how he managed to do it, but he must have been the one that led it right to us. There was no other explanation.</p><p>Leonore bravely stepped forward and asked, “Are these feybeasts not found in the south of Yurgenschmidt? How was one able to appear here?”</p><p>Professor Hirschur tapped her temple as she said, “They’re native to Werkestock. If we assume it was smuggled into the Sovereignty when it was still young enough to be handled, that would put it being brought here around the time their dorm was sealed off. Even if it could be hidden that long, it’s a ridiculous notion.”</p><p>One of the Sovereign Knights asked, “Could someone connected to Werekestock have brought it?”</p><p>As the knights and professors began discussing theories, Rozemyne asked Professor Hirschur, “My deepest apologies, but might I be permitted to heal the land?”</p><p>“Heal the land?” she repeated as everyone grew silent and stared at my sister.</p><p>She nodded. “As High Bishop, it’s my job to heal the land when it’s ravaged after an attack like this.”</p><p>“Ah, yes, Ehrenfest has trombes,” one of the knight’s order said. “You would have to do a ritual after one of them appeared.”</p><p>Everyone looked intrigued, so they agreed to let her perform the healing ritual so long as they got to observe. I grabbed her sleeve as she walked by and said, “Hey, that’s a lot of damage. If you teach me the prayer, I can help, too.”</p><p>She nodded, grateful for the help, and together we went to a space near the center of the circle that hadn’t been destroyed. The students, professors, and knights order gathered around us. Professor Hirschur started prodding Hartmut to record everything he saw as Rozemyne and I summoned our schtappes and transformed them into Flutrane’s staff to several exclamations of surprise.</p><p>“Ready?” Rozemyne asked, pressing the butt of her staff into the soft earth.</p><p>“Ready!” I said as I slammed mine into the ground.</p><p>I repeated the prayer after her, and boy, was it long, just like the darkness blessing one. As we chanted, a flash caught my attention, and as mana was drained from me, glowing lines began tracing along the ground.</p><p>“What is that?!” someone shouted.</p><p>“It’s a magic circle!” Professor Hirschur gasped. “Hartmut, copy it down!”</p><p>As we continued the prayer, the lines finished forming the magic circle. Suddenly, a lot of mana was sucked out of me all at once, and the circle began to rise, the plants growing with it. Rozemyne’s look of surprise said she’d just experienced the same mana drain, and we stared at each other in shock as the circle reached waist height, then chest, then passed over our heads, and continued climbing slowly.</p><p>“Potion!” Rozemyne cried, and Judith reached for one on my sister's belt, pulled off the lid, and handed it to her. The grimace told me which one she’d taken. With a curse, I demanded the same one from one of my retainers. It would be the last one I could safely take for the day, but I didn’t expect I’d need a lot more mana today. The Knight’s Order would be taking care of anything that required that much.</p><p>At last, the circle vanished, and Rozemyne and I dismissed our staffs, both grinning at each other as if to say, “Good job!” There was an awed silence around us, and as I spun around, I saw not only grass and small plants had grown, but full-sized trees with ripe fruit had appeared as well.</p><p>“That’s going to attract some powerful feybeasts,” I said. “Scholars and attendants, do not come out here without adequate protection. Lay- and medknights, always have at least one archknight with you or come in great numbers. There’s no sense in risking your safety for a few ingredients when a little forethought could prevent disaster.”</p><p>All the students nodded their assent as Professor Rauffen came over and slapped me on the shoulder hard enough to make me wince. “HA! This one’s ready for the knight course! You’ll make a fine knight, Wilfried! A fine knight indeed!”</p><p>“It wasn’t just grass…?” one of the Sovereign knights asked.</p><p>Rozemyne shook her head. “You can’t compare a typical blue priest to two archduke candidates with schtappes. They simply don’t have the mana we do.”</p><p>I was glad we were able to heal the gathering spot, but I really needed to get back to Ehrenfest. Professor Hirschur was busy talking with Hartmut, so there was no help coming from that quarter. The Sovereign knights were mostly looking around in a daze, Professor Rauffen was extolling the virtues of the knight course, and the Sovereign knight commander was studying me and my sister. I didn’t have time for more questions with obvious or impossible answers.</p><p>“Pardon, but I need to go report back to Ehrenfest to make sure Ordoschnelli doesn’t lose her way. Rozemyne, you’ll need to come, too, yeah?”</p><p>She picked up on what I was saying right away, so we both moved to take out our highbeasts.</p><p>“Wait.”</p><p>We both turned to the knight commander who was all but glowering at us. “We may call you in for questioning later. Be prepared to answer our summons at a moment’s notice.”</p><p>With nervous nods, we mounted our highbeasts and fled to the dormitory.</p><p>When we arrived, Charlotte was practically beside herself. “Brother! Sister! You were gone for so long! First that ordonnanz to Ignaz, then Alexis coming through with Traugott, and then you being gone all that time…! What was I supposed to think? Are you okay? What happened?”</p><p>I patted Rozemyne on the shoulder and asked, “You got this?”</p><p>“Yes, hurry back home.”</p><p>As I passed Brunhilde, I cursed myself for missing an opportunity to get a decent proposal feystone, but I wasn’t going to stick around any longer to find out if the knight’s order would give us a shot at ingredients from the ternisbefallen. Still, I shot her a smile to let her know everything was okay, and she looked a little relieved.</p><p>When I teleported back to Ehrenfest, Father and Karstedt were waiting for me. With a flick of his chin, he signaled for me to keep quiet and follow, so I did. Once we were in his office, he activated a sound-blocking tool and said, “Explain what happened.”</p><p>So I did - everything from when we first got the ordonnanz to Traugott’s betrayal to healing the land. The more I talked, the deeper his frown got until he seemed to give up and rest his forehead against his folded hands. Karstedt looked furious, but he remained standing silently behind Father.</p><p>“This is all we needed,” Father sighed. “You handled it well, though. I’m proud of you.”</p><p>The elation that swelled in me just narrowly beat out how Brunhilde’s smile had made me feel that morning. Somehow, finally creating the right shield seemed like it’d happened ages ago. Had all this really happened in a single day?</p><p>“Where’s Traugott?” I asked.</p><p>“Getting his memories searched by Justus.”</p><p>I nodded. “Do you think he did this because I dismissed him from my service?”</p><p>“It’s possible,” Father said, “but don’t blame yourself.”</p><p>“I don’t,” I said, shaking my head. “I’m just trying to figure out why this happened so I can deal with stuff like this before it gets to this point.”</p><p>Karstedt nodded in approval. “Just as a knight commander should do.”</p><p>“Speaking of,” I said, “I do have some good news. I finally was able to make the shield I need for the knight’s course.”</p><p>“Yeah?” Father asked, his face lighting with boyish excitement. “Let’s see it!”</p><p>I pulled out my schtappe and started to chant the spell just as the door burst open and Uncle strode into the sound barrier, looking angrier than I’d ever seen him, sending shivers down my spine.</p><p>He crossed his arms and said, “You need to execute Traugott.”</p>

<p>It was a pleasant day, all things considered. Ferdinand had a reasonable amount of work to complete that morning. He didn’t have to socialize until later that afternoon. He hadn’t received any headache-inducing reports for a couple of days. He even had a plate of his new favorite cookies on his desk as he went through some paperwork in his office.</p><p>It was no wonder, then, that he grimaced when he saw an ordonnanz fly into the room. It landed on the desk before him and said in Karstedt’s voice, “The Knight’s Order just received a request for emergency assistance from the Ehrenfest dormitory. They’ve caught a traitor that they’re bringing through.”</p><p>With his stomach sinking in cold dread, Ferdinand sent his acknowledgment back and rushed out the door. He ran through all his memories of the past weave, but he couldn’t think of who the traitor might be. There was Barthold who served Wilfried poorly, but his entire family had been executed, only his sister surviving to swear her name to Charlotte. He couldn’t think of what any of the other children would do to warrant this response, and he didn’t think the archduke candidates would be foolish enough to detain a noble from another duchy.</p><p>He arrived at the teleportation room to find several knights standing in formation around the circle while another group surrounded Sylvester, waiting at a safe distance.</p><p>“What is this about?” Ferdinand asked as he approached Sylvester and Karstedt.</p><p>“Dunno,” Sylvester said. “Ignaz sent a message on Wilfried’s behalf saying a traitor was coming. That’s all I know.”</p><p>The tension in the room grew more with each passing moment until it was thick enough to suffocate its occupants. Finally, the circle started to glow, and everyone readied themselves.</p><p>Alexis appeared, holding a bound Traugott by the scruff of his neck. The room froze in shock as Justus inhaled sharply behind Ferdinand.</p><p>Karstedt ordered a group of knights to take the boy to an interrogation room as Ferdinand stepped forward to receive the report.</p><p>“Lord Ferdinand,” Alexis said as he crossed his arms and bowed. Then, his eyes scanned the room, indicating his words were not meant for so many ears. Ferdinand passed him a sound-blocking tool, and the boy spoke. “A ternisbefallen attacked the Ehrenfest gathering spot. As we were trying to lead it away, Traugott fired two full-strength attacks at it. He then fed it two feystones that I believe were filled with mana before trying to escape. Of note as well is his vastly superior mana quantity compared to last year, though he hasn’t learned Lady Rozemyne’s mana compression method.”</p><p>“I see. What is the feybeast’s current status?”</p><p>Alexis looked down. “When I left under Lord Wilfried’s orders, it had grown to a horrific scale, rivaling some of the smaller winter mansions. I believe the apprentice knights were regrouping to start trying to lead it away again. Professor Hirschur and Professor Rauffen had already been alerted by the time I arrived at the dorm, so it shouldn’t be long before they respond.”</p><p>Ferdinand fought back the urge to curse. This was significantly worse than the attack in the first weave. Had binding Traugott with contract magic actually been the correct call, even though it defied all common sense? He found himself sending a prayer to Mestionora of all people that Rozemyne would remember their conversation about creating black weapons. They did not want to invite more scrutiny.</p><p>“Good work. Return to the Academy,” Ferdinand said, taking back the tool. His mind reeled as he returned to Sylvester, and he noticed the dark look on Justus' face, meaning he’d been able to read Alexis’ lips from across the room.</p><p>Passing sound blockers to Sylvester and Karstedt, Ferdinand explained, “Traugott deliberately fed enormous quantities of mana to a ternisbefallen that appeared in the Ehrenfest gathering spot before attempting to flee.”</p><p>“What?!” Sylvester balked.</p><p>“What was a ternisbefallen doing at the Royal Academy?” Karstedt asked.</p><p>Ferdinand shook his head. “Let’s spend our energy questioning the person who might actually have answers. Sylvester, I request we use the memory-searching tool.”</p><p>“Granted,” he said with a wave of his hand, sending Karstedt to go fetch it. “Which of us is going to match him the closest do you figure?”</p><p>“Justus if I had to guess since they share blood.”</p><p>“Hmm… Makes sense, but let’s all get tested just to be sure. Traugott’s mana quantity is bound to be a lot lower either way.”</p><p>“Yes, about that - his capacity was reported to have increased significantly since last year.”</p><p>“How?!” Sylvester gasped. “I know for a fact I didn’t approve him to learn Rozemyne’s compression method!”</p><p>“Again, a question better left to the person who would know the answer.”</p><p>Karstedt entered the room, carrying a small box. With a nod from Sylvester, they left for the interrogation chamber in the knight building. The tests revealed that Justus was indeed most suited to reading Traugott’s memories, so Ferdinand stayed behind with him as the other two men returned to the main building upon receiving word that Wilfried would be arriving soon.</p><p>Reading the memories of an unwilling subject was always a drawn out process, so while they waited, Ferdinand and Eckhart took the opportunity to train Janrik in a few more poison-detecting methods.</p><p>“My lord,” Janrik said, “this goes beyond even what my father knew to perform, and he was always cautious to the point of paranoia. Was…was it truly that dangerous for you living under Lady Veronica?”</p><p>Eckhart nodded. “The poison and assassination attempts were constant and varied. This was in addition to ostracization and more general harassment, so we were never out of danger’s shadow. We couldn’t even fully relax at the Royal Academy, nor could Lord Ferdinand at the temple.”</p><p>Ferdinand smirked. “I caught one of Bezewanst’s gray shrine maidens trying to poison my food once, so I returned the favor. He, at least, was not foolish enough to repeat the attempt.”</p><p>Janrik shook his head in disbelief before he dropped his gaze. “I apologize. I had no idea. I had heard that you wanted to take the seat of aub when I was younger, but those rumors died out after you joined the temple. I’d known you to be an enemy of Lady Veronica and her faction, but I see now that it was the other way around.” His face contorted in confused pain for several moments before Ferdinand spoke again.</p><p>“It’s always difficult when you have to come to terms with known truths being proven false. It is not a fast process, so do not try to speed through it lest you replace one set of lies for another.”</p><p>It was then that Justus appeared, his expression murderous. They immediately erected a sound barrier, and while Ferdinand’s initial instinct was to force Janrik out, he chose instead to let him hear this side of the truth to aid in his education.</p><p>“My lord, it’s worse than I believe other of us thought possible.”</p><p>Ferdinand's stomach sank. “Go on.”</p><p>Justus then described what he’d witnessed in the boy’s head. Traugott had been humiliated by his public dismissal and Justus’ inattentive service, not grasping the reason why his uncle was sent in the first place despite having it spelled out for him. He was ostracized from the rest of the Ehrenfest students, and not even the Saint extended a hand to him.</p><p>It was therefore easy for an Ahrensbach student looking for a weak point to exploit to coax him into sharing intelligence. Last year, it had been simple enough - confirming the archducal children were all part of the temple and performed religious ceremonies, the Saint of Ehrenfest gave real blessings including a blessing of Angriff that increased battle performance, and how Ehrenfest used picture books and card games to boost their grades. Thankfully, he wasn’t able at the time to go into detail about either of the products he mentioned since he didn’t have his personal copies with him. This was all in exchange for Georgine’s compression method, which she delivered through one of the students during the interduchy tournament, buying his complete loyalty.</p><p>This year, however, he led with information about the purge, noting several of the nobles who were executed, imprisoned, or fined as well as which of them had children that were spared through name swearing, being taken in by other family members, or being taken to the temple. This information also included Bettina’s imprisonment and Aurelia’s apparent house arrest.</p><p>He passed them his personal copies of two of the picture books and a karuta deck along with tidbits about the printing industry - namely that Ehrenfest was capable of reproducing many books quickly. Thankfully, he knew nothing beyond that, but even that much could prove damaging.</p><p>He also told them what he knew of Rozemyne’s and Wilfried’s engagements. That mostly consisted of Ferdinand’s and Wilfried’s plans to become knight commander at different points in the future and information on Brunhilde’s home, status, and family.</p><p>A couple of weeks ago, he was informed of a plan to attack the Ehrenfest gathering spot. Any resistance he had to it died the moment he was promised to be taken into Ahrensbach. The fool didn’t realize he’d never be allowed to go as an underaged student, and if he moved upon coming of age, he would have outlived his usefulness. He’d no longer be in a position to gather intelligence on Ehrenfest since no one would trust him enough to speak to him, much less send him information.</p><p>His part in the plan was simple - find a way to lure Wilfried to the gathering spot, show everyone how much he’d grown by firing mana attacks at the beast, feed it the filled feystones he was provided, and then create an opportunity for Wilfried to be injured but not killed. He could even attack the boy himself so long as the job was done. If the Saint of Ehrenfest arrived, he was free to lead her to her death so long as it didn’t interfere with the other duties he’d been assigned.</p><p>“I imagine Gudrun would be willing to swear her name to Lady Charlotte so long as she’s guaranteed the seat of aub. She won’t want a repeat of what happened with Georgine.”</p><p>Ferdinand shook his head. “We can’t guarantee it until she has an archduke candidate for a partner.”</p><p>Justus nodded. “I’m aware. I doubt she’ll swear it to Rozemyne. She might serve Florencia, but ultimately, if she swears it to Charlotte, be aware that she’ll harbor discontent and resentment should she not become aub.”</p><p>“What of her husband?”</p><p>“What of him?” Justus shot back with a shrug. “It’d be better for him to die along with his idiot son. The general intelligence of Ehrenfest would rise by several degrees with his demise.”</p><p>Ferdinand nodded and then got to his feet, deactivating the sound-blocking tool. After ordering one of the knights to place Traugott in a cell, he and his retainers flew to the main building and marched down the halls to the aub’s office. Eckhart, Justus, and Janrik stayed behind as he threw open the door, stepped into the sound barrier, and stated, “You need to execute Traugott.”</p><p>Everyone blinked at him as though he were speaking a foreign language. He waited impatiently for them to process his words.</p><p>Eventually, Sylvester recovered enough to send Wilfried from the room and ask what they’d found. When he finished explaining, Sylvester slammed his fists against the desk, leapt to his feet, and declared, “That’s it! I’m filing an official complaint with the zent! She can’t get away with it this time! She’s gone after all three of my baptized kids now, and what does this attempt make on Rozemyne? Four? Five?”</p><p>Ferdinand tapped his temple as his brother ordered Karstedt to provide him with parchment and ink. Georgine already had access to trug, meaning Raublut would as well if she’d already won him to her side. However, he didn’t think that happened until after he had been sent to investigate Ahrensbach, which would happen soon. It was likely currently safe to file a complaint, but Ferdinand didn’t expect it to go anywhere since it was the neutral Tenth speaking against the allied Sixth. Not to mention, Georgine would sacrifice the student Traugott made contact with. She may even blame them for the entire ternisbefallen incident. Ferdinand doubted she didn’t have the foresight to use a former Werkestock student, after all.</p><p>If she went that route, it was possible the investigation would center around the student rather than Werkestock itself, possibly preventing Georgine and Raublut’s meeting. Even if they did meet, could he or Sylvester get word to the royal family about a sweet-smelling drug from Ahrensbach that made one vulnerable to suggestion? He’d actually found some samples of it amongst Gerlach’s effects, so he could include some of it in a report. However, he suspected it wouldn’t make it past the knight commander given his history with Adalgisa.</p><p>Well, they did have two direct connections with royalty. If Rozemyne was destined to cause trouble with Eglantine and Anastasius, perhaps they could use it to their advantage.</p><p>“Before you do that,” Ferdinand cautioned his brother, “let me send a letter to Rozemyne to pass along to the prince or princess.” He explained his reasoning - that his tests had shown the mysterious substance found amongst Gerlach’s things was trug, that it came to him from Ahrensbach, and that it was possible any investigation into the duchy might expose the knight’s order to its effects. “If we can warn them ahead of time, however, we could at least put the royal family on guard.”</p><p>Sylvester furrowed his brows and then sat back down. “My gut is telling me you’re onto something here. I wouldn’t put it past Georgine to have some kind of plan to put the zent in the palm of her hand. What do I say, though, when I’m asked why I waited to report this?”</p><p>“Say you were ensuring the veracity of the evidence. They would expect you to do as much, especially as the Tenth.”</p><p>“Alright. I’ll leave this part in your hands, then. We’ll wait to execute Traugott until we’re sure we no longer need him for evidence. In the meantime, have Justus work out what Traugott’s parents are going to do. They’ll be treated the same way as the families of the traitors from the purge.”</p><p>Ferdinand dismissed Justus for the day to handle his personal affairs, sent Ottilie to replace Rihyarda at the Academy so the latter could return home, and then locked himself in his hidden room to write his letters.</p><p>The first was to whichever member of royalty Rozemyne felt more certain would read and take it seriously, explaining what he’d discussed with Sylvester and the contents of the package he was sending. In the package itself, he put a sample of the drug along with one of Schlaftraum’s flowers and a detailed copy of his “research results.”</p><p>The next was a general explanation to Rozemyne of what he needed her to do - work with the other archduke candidates to restore order in the dormitory, give the sealed letter and package directly to a member of royalty, and be more on guard against Ahrensbach than ever. He then wrote in glowing ink, “Read the third letter in your hidden room after you meet with and are questioned by royalty.”</p><p>The third letter he wrote entirely in invisible ink.</p><p>
<em>Rozemyne,</em>
</p><p>
<em>Traugott was being manipulated by Georgine through an Ahrensbach student. You are not to make contact with anyone from that duchy, even Raymund if you can help it. Continue to communicate with him through Professor Hirschur.</em>
</p><p>
<em>The ternisbefallen was intended to wound Wilfried and kill you if possible, at least according to the orders given to Traugott. He’s been leaking information to Ahrensbach, including your picture books and karuta; information about you, me, Wilfried, Brunhilde, and Aurelia; what little he knows of the printing industry; and the purge. I do not know what Ahrensbach intends to do with this information, but be on guard.</em>
</p><p>
<em>In the letter to royalty, I have explained that we came across a drug from Ahrensbach amongst the belongings of the purged that they need to be aware of. When its smoke is inhaled, it muddles one’s mind and makes them susceptible to suggestion to a frightening degree. My research has revealed that using waschen on the victim will remove the effects, but it seems the more they’ve inhaled over time, the longer the waschen will last. The sample of the drug included in the package you delivered should be enough for them to let their retainers test it and then acquaint themselves with its sweet scent so that they won’t find themselves falling victim to its effects.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Likewise, I intend to expose all of the archducal family and their retainers to the fragrance so you, too, can recognize it. It’s a very distinctive if faint odor.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Be careful, Rozemyne. Do not reveal too much, do not leave the sight of your guard knights, and do not seek out trouble. If you were not so looking forward to your tea party with Hannelore and Professor Solange, I would have called you back home immediately if for no other reason than to ensure your safety. Your enemies are powerful, but your allies are more so. Strengthen your bonds with Dunkelfelger. There can be few stronger allies standing at your back. If you and your retainers judge Drewanchel’s archduke candidate to be trustworthy enough, draw them to your side as well. Build as many defenses as you can.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I can do little from Ehrenfest to protect you while you’re at the Academy save for the charms I’ve given you. Please, heed the warnings of your guard knights and siblings and stay safe.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I don’t know what I would do if I lost you.</em>
</p><p>
<em>— Ferdinand </em>

<p>Two days passed before Ferdinand heard from Justus after he was given time to settle matters with his family. As expected, everyone was beside themselves with anger and regret. Traugott had to be moved to a secret, secure location to ensure Bonifatius didn’t barge in and murder the boy before they were ready to execute him, though with how livid Rihyarda had become, Ferdinand was more concerned about her than the former knight commander. Justus bemoaned his weakness for “choosing to let go” when he’d had the chance to strangle him to death after his dismissal last year. Gudrun was already disappointed enough with her son to want to cut ties with him. Now, she’d written him off entirely, reportedly saying, “I was entirely loyal to Lady Georgine while she was still in Ehrenfest, but the moment she left for Ahrensbach and I remained here, she was no longer my lady. How had Traugott failed to learn such a basic lesson when it was modeled right before him every day of his life? I didn’t think he could prove to be more foolish or bring more shame upon the family than he already had, but I see that at least in this, he has exceeded my expectations.” Her husband likewise already considered him dead.</p><p>The two of them began arguing over who was truly to blame for their son’s poor upbringing at some point. Eventually, they agreed that no mutually satisfying conclusion could be reached. It seemed that they would be seeking a divorce next year, much to Justus’ relief.</p><p>They had both resolved to swear their names to the archducal couple, choosing to ignore Bonifatius as he complained that they were sullying the beauty of name swearing and reducing it to an act committed by criminals seeking to escape punishment. No matter how righteous his indignation, neither wanted to die for their son’s foolishness. It would take some time before they could provide a name stone as they couldn’t obtain the necessary materials during winter, but Sylvester and Florencia were willing to wait until the end of the following autumn.</p><p>Much happened at the Academy during the two days Ferdinand had been waiting for Justus to report back. For one, Rozemyne had completed her tea party for bookworms with Professor Solange and Hannelore, something she’d been unable to accomplish in the past weave. She’d reaffirmed her friendship with the Dunkelfelger archduke candidate and managed to extract a promise of support from her in the future, though it was in return for the same. When they returned each other’s books, she’d provided Hannelore with the modern translation of the Dunkelfelger history book she’d borrowed, saying, “I would be ever so grateful if you would check it for accuracy at your leisure. It was so wonderful learning about your deep and thrilling history that I am quite looking forward to hear Aub Dunkelfelger’s thoughts on it as well as what book he will bring during the interduchy tournament.” With that, she’d all but guaranteed his visit to their table, and allowing everyone to see him lend her such a valuable treasure for a second time would cement their alliance in their onlookers’ minds and make it difficult for anyone to make any overt moves against them.</p><p>Rozemyne had also taken this opportunity to lend out two Ehrenfest books to Professor Solange and Hannelore. In return, she received another thick volume of history from Dunkelfelger and the diaries of the executed librarians. Ferdinand would have to caution Rozemyne to keep the latter a secret to avoid drawing suspicion from the Sovereign Knight’s Order.</p><p>An invitation from Drewanchel arrived at the Ehrenfest dorms, though it was addressed to all the archduke candidates, Rozemyne for obvious reasons, Wilfried for his ability to create divine weapons and his part in the healing ritual, and Charlotte for her success spreading trends and potential to follow in her siblings’ footsteps given her association with the temple. Rudiger’s frequent claims that Wilfried’s advice about participating in religious ceremonies had all but turned around their duchy’s mana crisis had drawn a lot of attention, so drawing close to Drewanchel to allow them to act as gatekeepers for any interested in learning more would prove beneficial.</p><p>At least two of Drewanchel’s archduke candidates would be in attendance at the tea party, and it was evident that Adolphine was considering Charlotte as a potential match for her little brother. Ferdinand, Rozemyne, and Charlotte all agreed that they should exploit that opening to their benefit if given the opportunity, though they would have to make clear that Charlotte would not be leaving Ehrenfest so as not to give the appearance of making false promises.</p><p>Rozemyne also received an invitation from Eglantine for a tea party, and so the Ehrenfest archducal apprentice attendants scheduled both to take place before the children were due to return for the Dedication Ritual.</p><p>The following morning, Ferdinand’s anxiety spiked as he read a letter from Hartmut stating Rozemyne had been summoned by Prince Anastasius for a meeting that afternoon. He tried doing paperwork, training at the practice grounds, and even conducting research on some of the materials Rozemyne’s and Wilfried’s retainers had sent after the healing ritual, but nothing could distract him from his anxiety. He ended up pacing his office, holding his finger to the furrow in his brows as his mind raced through every possible consequence that could arise from this meeting. It wasn’t until after the God of Darkness’ cape covered the sky that the reports arrived.</p><p>Compared to all her previous reports, Rozemyne’s recounting of the event was rather thorough.</p><p>
<em>To my fiancé,</em>
</p><p>
<em>As you were informed this morning, I had to respond to Prince Anastasius’ summons this afternoon. The meeting began peacefully enough. I was served my favorite tea, but sadly, their sweets were nothing more than pretty lumps of sugar. Once again, the prince seemed to enjoy his rumtopf-decorated pound cake, but he also quite liked the mille crepes once they, too, were topped with rumtopf. We had a pleasant conversation about how my classes had fared and the trends Ehrenfest was spreading.</em>
</p><p>
<em>It was at this point he handed me a sound-blocking tool and asked to order a high-quality hairpin for Eglantine. After getting her favorite flowers and her birth season, I agreed to have my personal craftswoman construct it for him as a gift. He seemed exceptionally pleased.</em>
</p><p>
<em>He then had the room cleared save for his head attendant and Hartmut, I’m assuming because he’d been present at the attack. I doubt the prince developed a sense of propriety over the past year given how he greeted me at the fellowship gathering.</em>
</p><p>
<em>He began questioning me about the ternisbefallen incident, and it was immediately clear this was the true purpose behind the summons. He was apparently conducting his own investigation into the matter rather than leaving it solely to the Sovereign Knight’s Order. I told him what I was able, and he demonstrated once again his willingness to listen and not begrudge the testimony of a neutral duchy so low in the rankings. It was for this reason and the fact that Lady Eglantine seems content to avoid the rest of the royal family that I decided to entrust the letter and package you’d sent to him.</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand rubbed his temples and groaned, his stomach twisting as he agonized over whether she’d made the right call. It made sense that Eglantine was avoiding the other royals, especially if Anastasius was ordering hairpins for her. That being the case, he could understand why Rozemyne would judge it better to avoid involving her. However, he had no confidence in a prince who would throw away everything for the convenience of a single woman. Only a fool in such a position of power would do something so thoughtless.</p><p>He skimmed the rest of Rozemyne’s letter, which went on to summarize her conversation with the prince, but Hartmut had included it word-for-word in his report, having mastered lipreading after studying under Justus for so long. Ferdinand skipped through the first round of questioning, which was just a basic recounting of the attack and healing ritual that followed, and instead focused on the moment his evidence was brought up.</p><p>
<em>My lady then spoke to the prince about the items you had sent.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Her words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“If I may, Prince Anastasius, there is some information I suspect is related to the incident that my guardians wanted me to share with the royal family.</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand frowned. He didn’t appreciate being relegated to “guardian” status rather than “fiancé,” though he understood her reasoning. Anastasius had thus far shown hostility whenever Rozemyne’s engagement came up, and since she hoped to win him as an ally, she wanted to avoid anything that might cause him to feel any resistance to her words. He hoped, however, the prince wouldn’t take it as some form of invitation.</p><p>
<em>May I deliver a letter from them to you?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>He raised his brows in obvious interest and confusion.</em>
</p><p>
<em>His words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“You would entrust it to me rather than Princess Eglantine?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Her words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Forgive me for saying so, but I have seen you act in your role as prince on a number of occasions now, and it has instilled in me a great amount of confidence in your abilities. I would entrust this to no other.”</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and then dropped his head against his desk. Over and over again, he repeated that he understood what she was doing, that she was rather skillfully manipulating a prince to get her desired result, but he kept wanting to scream, “You will receive much more than you intend with these foolish tactics!” He would have to consult with Elvira regarding her socializing.</p><p>
<em>Receiving such magnanimous praise directly from the lips of our goddess brought him no end of satisfaction. I believe with these two sentences, she made of him the most steadfast of allies. I would defy any man to hear such beautiful words in her melodic voice and not wish to fall down in worship of her.</em>
</p><p>“That is precisely the problem, Hartmut!” Ferdinand yelled, crumpling the edges of the paper in his clenched fists.</p><p>
<em>It was at this point that I passed the sealed envelope to the prince’s attendant. He performed the careful checks one would expect of those serving royalty before presenting it to his liege. Prince Anastasius asked for our goddess’ consideration as he opted to read the letter immediately. As his eyes traced your words, they widened further and further as the color drained from his face.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Lady Rozemyne was the perfect picture of concern when he finished reading it a second time.</em>
</p><p>
<em>His words upon folding the letter and meeting her gaze:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Are you aware of the contents of this letter?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Her words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“My deepest apologies, but I have already shared all that I know of it.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>His words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“I see. Let’s dispense with Grammaratur’s dance. Tell me, there was a purge carried out in Ehrenfest early this autumn, was there not?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Her hesitant words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“I am ashamed to admit it, but yes, there was.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>His words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Explain to me the circumstances that led to this purge.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Her words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“As you know, there was a wedding between two Ehrenfest grooms and two Ahrensbach brides at our border gate near the end of summer. I received word that an ambush was planned for those of us from the temple. After reporting this to my guardians, they prepared a trap and captured the ones sent to attack us. They were devouring soldiers from two of our giebes. Both giebes were captured alive and subjected to memory searches, which revealed they were name-sworn to Lady Georgine of Ahrensbach, and they were making plans with her to have her visit Ehrenfest in the near future. I’m not certain what their purpose was, though.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>His words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“And there were others who were name-sworn to Lady Georgine within Ehrenfest?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Her words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“That is my understanding, yes.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>His words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“I see. Tell me what you know of trug.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Her words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“My deepest apologies, but I am unfamiliar with that word.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>His words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Then perhaps you know something about a substance that produces a sweet-smelling scent when burned?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Her words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Like dried apfelsige peels?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>His words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Never mind. Tell me about the attack you suffered that put you in a jureve for so long.”</em>
</p><p>Rozemyne described the night of the attack, explaining how devouring soldiers from an Ahrensbach noble had attacked, allowing another noble to kidnap Charlotte, and how her desperate chase to save her little sister gave Giebe Gerlach the opportunity to poison her. This led to her having to tell the prince about Count Bindewald’s attempt to kidnap her, which was when Gerlach obtained his soldiers.</p><p>
<em>His words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“So your relationship with Ahrensbach has been under the influence of Chaocipher for quite some time. Why not say anything to the royal family before now?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Her words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“My deepest apologies, but I cannot answer that question as it is the aub’s decision whether or not to make a report.”</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand had never been so proud of Rozemyne as he was at that moment. In the past, she certainly would have offered an unsolicited opinion, which would have created a political nightmare for him and Sylvester to deal with.</p><p>After that, the prince demanded to know more about Traugott. When Rozemyne’s eyes drifted to Ferdinand’s letter, Anastasius told her to assume he’d already received answers to everything he was asking her.</p><p>
<em>Her words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Traugott was one of my brother’s guard knights. However, after he publicly disrespected me during the ditter match with Dunkelfelger last year, he was dismissed. I heard that he seemed to have deliberately fed mana to the ternisbefallen, but nothing could be determined until he was taken back to Ehrenfest for questioning.</em>
</p><p>
<em>His words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“And what of his contact with Ahrensbach?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Her words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“My deepest apologies, but I was unaware of any such contact.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>His words:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Very well. Oswin, summon my head scholar.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Emmerich, the prince’s head scholar, was brought into the room, and at the prince’s behest, I provided him with the package, which he performed careful checks on. After the prince cautioned Rozemyne to remain vigilant, we were dismissed.</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand did not agree with all the methods, but he was pleased with the result. Their narrative had reached royal ears before Ahrensbach’s, and Georgine would be unable to provide any evidence to refute their claims. They were now also in possession of trug, meaning they were far less likely to fall victim to it. He held a very mild concern that Anastasius might try to employ its use to win Eglantine’s heart, but he chose to believe his desire for her earnest love would win out against the temptation.</p><p>The next afternoon, Ferdinand received another letter from Rozemyne.</p><p>
<em>To my fiancé,</em>
</p><p>
<em>You should have warned me not to read your letter until right before bed! My attendants were in a panic this morning when I left my hidden room with red, puffy eyes! They had to summon Charlotte to come offer me Heilschmerz’s healing. Do you know how embarrassing that was? She peppered me with questions all throughout breakfast, but I couldn’t tell her I’d been moved to tears by your unexpectedly sweet words!</em>
</p><p>
<em>…So unexpectedly sweet as to be suspicious, that is! If you want me to take my safety seriously, just say so. You don’t have to try so hard to manipulate me.</em>
</p><p>Damn it, she’d caught him. He couldn’t deny, however, the words had been heartfelt, even if he’d included them to ensure she wouldn’t run headlong into danger as she was wont to do.</p><p>
<em>Anyway, I assume you’ll be executing Traugott posthate for this unforgivable treachery? I don’t have time to plan a proper bloody carnival at the moment. I instead need to get permission from Sylvester to start spreading karuta and picture books before Ahrensbach makes a move. We’re already lending out certain books to our friends from other duchies, so this may be the time to start shilling the printing industry since it’s also already been leaked. It will make for a headache-inducing Archduke Conference, but I fear our hands are tied at this point.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Before we do this, however, I believe it won’t take long for Drewanchel to piece together how printing works. I’ll try to throw them off by suggesting magic circles are involved somehow, but I don’t expect it to work for long. To that end, I would like to request we put a country-wide magic contract in place following the same procedure as the patent we made for the hand pumps. I want it to state that if anyone outside of Ehrenfest uses printing technology, they have to pay a royalty fee to us. In exchange, they will be taught the fundamentals of the printing industry. We should make a separate one for plant paper as well. That way, even if other duchies start relying on their own printed goods rather than purchasing any from Ehrenfest, we’ll still profit from every book they print and piece of paper they produce. This will also ensure our name is always associated with this technology, and since these contracts will naturally include the Legal Deposit Law, Ehrenfest will benefit from obtaining a copy of every book printed, allowing us to create a national bibliography that will catalog all the printed materials in the kingdom. Our influence will grow just like Sylvester wants.</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand groaned and rubbed his temples. He knew she was just vying for more books to read, but surely she could understand why having Ehrenfest as the seat of all printed material was a terrible, nigh-treacherous idea. They’d have to write the law to have the materials sent to the palace library instead, which would mean getting the royal family involved in writing the contract at the very least, and there was no chance they would allow the clause requiring copies of each book to be sent to the Saint of Ehrenfest to remain. Perhaps if she’d already created Alexandria as the library city she envisioned and had the zent’s name…</p><p>Alas, Traugott’s betrayal would not allow them that much time. Ferdinand would instead speak to Sylvester about creating country-wide contracts to be signed with individual duchies for rights to printing and paper-making technology with the patent fees included. They could negotiate on the legal deposit system, which would likely manifest as Ehrenfest having the right to purchase a copy of any book printed, though he wasn’t sure what they would ask for in exchange. Either way, they would need to meet with Drewanchel and Dunkelfelger about the matter as soon as possible.</p><p>With a sigh, he finished reading the letter.</p><p>
<em>I imagine we’ll have the opportunity to discuss this more once I return for the Dedication Ritual.</em>
</p><p>
<em>How are you doing? Are you eating well and sleeping enough? You have to take care of yourself. I don’t want to be a widow before I’m 30, nor do I want our children to grow up without a father.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Please, take care of yourself, and in return I promise I’ll spend the rest of my life making you happy.</em>
</p><p>
<em>– Rozemyne</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand’s ears burned as he cursed her for her wicked revenge. A smile he could hide, but he could not control his blush. He needed to meet with Sylvester immediately, but he didn’t dare show himself before that man in this state. He’d certainly be ridiculed to death.</p><p>It only took half a bell to get himself under control, and when he met with Sylvester, they discussed their options. For now, they would send several karuta decks and three copies each of the two picture books Traugott had provided to Ahrensbach as well as one he didn’t just to serve as proof of their authorship.</p><p>While they were discussing what to do about the printing industry, another letter arrived, and Sylvester almost fainted when he saw who it was from. His hands trembled and his eyes wavered as he read the message before he passed it over to Ferdinand to read, his face ghastly white.</p><p>
<em>Aub Ehrenfest,</em>
</p><p>
<em>I hereby command you to keep the traitor Traugott alive for questioning by the royal family. Given the nature of the accusations that have been laid, you are hereby permitted to deny any contact and cease any trade with Ahrensbach until my investigation has concluded.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I will summon you once I am prepared. Be ready to respond at once.</em>
</p><p>
<em>From His Highness, Prince Anastasius Sohn Zent Trauerqual</em>
</p><p>“He’s kidding, right?” Sylvester asked. “How am I supposed to just cut off contact with Ahrensbach? It’s not like I can tell them, ‘You finally slipped up and left too much evidence behind, so the Zent says I don’t have to talk to you anymore!’ We can’t stop trade, either. We’re pretty dependent on sugar for our culinary trends.”</p><p>Ferdinand tapped his temples. “Agreed, and do recall this is from the second prince, not the king. In the end, it doesn’t matter what he permits. We can try to avoid them as much as possible, but they will almost certainly approach us when we’re unable to outmaneuver them, such as during the interduchy tournament. I’ll have Rozemyne send word to Aubs Dunkelfelger and Drewanchel through their archduke candidates, suggesting we wish to talk about the printing industry with them. That should keep both aubs at our table for quite some time. The prince may stop by as well, as might Princess Eglantine. Ahrensbach won’t be able to approach while they’re visiting, so that will greatly reduce the time in which they’re able to approach us. They will undoubtedly be looking for an opening, however, so these efforts likely won’t prevent their visit.</p><p>“Georgine is a master of manipulating situations to her favor. Watch your facial expressions and body language. You don’t want her to make you appear hostile or gloating, nor do you want to bow your head to her as an aub. She will surely try to taunt you using the attacks on your children, but you will need to let it be as Schneeahst’s ice in Leidenschaft’s rays. We’ll need to caution Rozemyne as well since Georgine is sure to bring up the printed materials she managed to obtain. I have full faith that Charlotte will be able to handle herself, but Wilfried is easily baited by anything involving the safety of his sisters. You’ll need to keep an eye on him as well as yourself.”</p><p>Sylvester nodded along as Ferdinand listed every warning he could think of then said, “You’ll handle Rozemyne, though, right?”</p><p>“As is my duty.”</p><p>“Duty. Right.” Sylvester sighed and leaned back in his chair, looking as though he was in desperate need of a rejuvenation potion. “You know, when I adopted her, I thought I was offering her protection in exchange for the industries and mana she would provide Ehrenfest. I’m definitely not holding up my end of the bargain. In fact, I think I might have put her in more danger than she was before.”</p><p>“No one could predict the Georgine faction would make such blatantly treacherous moves against the archducal family,” Ferdinand said in an attempt to console him. He had vowed multiple times to protect her himself, and yet how many times had he failed her?</p><p>Not this time, though. Despite everything spiraling out of his control, Rozemyne was in a better position now than she was in the previous weave. She no longer collapsed whenever she got excited, so she could talk with her friends about books for as long as they could stomach it. She was growing in accordance with her age, so she was no longer the small, weak child that attracted so much negative attention. She was more socially competent, so she wouldn’t be taken advantage of so easily. There was also the support of her siblings she didn’t have before. Wilfried making divine instruments and helping with the healing ritual shifted the focus from her to the temple, making Rozemyne less of a threat or an object of curiosity. When Charlotte took the schtappe-morphing class next year, it would further emphasize the role of the temple, not the Saint of Ehrenfest.</p><p>In the end, though she still faced many outside threats, her general quality of life had improved significantly from the past weave, and Ferdinand intended to do whatever it took to let her enjoy all that had been denied her before.</p><p>Nodding to himself, Ferdinand sat across from his brother and said, “Let’s summon Elvira and discuss what we’re going to say to Dunkelfelger and Drewanchel about the printing industry.”</p><p>Elvira made time to meet with them the following morning, and they worked straight through until fourth bell when they broke for lunch. They had the basic foundation for their conversations laid; they just needed to finish agreeing on some of the finer points. The greatest difficulty they were facing was ensuring the terms would be agreeable to Rozemyne. She would be able to weigh in once she returned, but they wanted to have as much completed as possible since her time would be rather limited. She was focusing quite a lot of effort on building relationships with allies, and all three children wanted to spend as much time at the Academy as they could this year since they needed to spread two more trends they’d originally planned to keep secret. Ehrenfest might lose its advantage in grades as a result, but the influence they would gain from the printing industry was immeasurable.</p><p>Once they finalized the last few details, Elvira asked both men to join her and Florencia for tea the following day. Sensing something amiss, they readily agreed.</p><p>As they sipped their tea and ate their tarts the following day, the four of them chatted about the minor gossip flying around, the rising popularity of cloth dyed in the new fashion, and the children’s academic performance. Once Elvira had her tea refreshed and turned on the sound-blocking barrier, however, the mood instantly shifted.</p><p>“Word has reached several ears about the healing ritual at the Academy,” Elvira said. “You can imagine, I’m sure, how the northern giebes who no longer have stages are reacting, especially after the Haldenzel Miracle. While many are aware that the healing ritual is regularly performed after trombe subjugations thanks to several having family members in the Knight’s Order, the fact that even trees bearing ripe fruit appeared is leading them to believe the Saint of Ehrenfest can restore their lands even without the stages.”</p><p>Florencia sighed. “Some have claimed that the difference between what happened at the gathering site and what occurs after trombe subjugations can be explained by Wilfried’s assistance. They’re claiming that if both of them perform the ritual, they’ll have an early spring. Once they realize this isn’t the case…”</p><p>Ferdinand nodded as Sylvester paled. “Don’t tell me I put down a soon-to-be rebellion just to have another pop up out of nowhere!”</p><p>“It won’t grow into a true rebellion,” Elvira assured the aub. “However, it will affect the support base we’re trying to build for the archducal family.”</p><p>“Very well,” Ferdinand said. “Let’s use this as an opportunity to prop up Sylvester. You can go search in the archduke’s archive for information about the stage. Once the giebes know you’re working so diligently on their behalf, that should appease them somewhat. I’ll have the priests start searching temple records. Rozemyne can organize a search of the Royal Academy Library.” He knew the information was in the inaccessible Underground Archive, but the goal wasn’t to find the answer; it was to convince onlookers that the archduke family was sparing no effort in finding it.</p><p>Sylvester grumbled a bit but agreed to the plan. Elvira and Florencia started discussing how they would share this information at tea parties. Ferdinand, meanwhile, began trying to determine how to write a letter to Rozemyne asking her to do research in the library while still ensuring she would maintain her socializing schedule.</p><p>He’d given himself an impossible task. Perhaps he really was a fool.</p>

<p>Ferdinand prepared himself for a headache when he saw the thick bundle that was Hirchur’s weekly report. Sylvester took several steadying breaths before he bravely charged forward, reading her words aloud.</p><p>
<em>Aub Ehrenfest,</em>
</p><p>
<em>The disconcertingly straight trail of the ternisbefallen led to the old Werkestock dormitory, currently under the management of Ahrensbach. Professor Fraularm was kicking up such a fuss about Ahrensbach’s innocence that anyone with half a brain would realize she was trying to hide something, and that’s without knowing her connection to the noble who tried to kidnap Rozemyne the first time.
</em></p><p>
<em>When speaking with the prince to seek his permission to investigate the abandoned dormitory, I suggested that Professor Rauffen, Professor Fraularm, and I remain behind as we all had reason to lack objectivity - Rauffen and Fraularm as former residents of the duchies managing old Werkestock and myself as a former resident of the home of the victims. Despite Fraularm’s shrieks of protest, the prince agreed with my suggestion. </em>
</p><p>
<em>As anyone would have suspected, there was evidence that someone had not only been inside the dorms but had also used the teleportation circle in recent days. None of us were sure how they managed it as the circle was supposed to be sealed and guarded on the Werkestock side. It was at this point Prince Anastasius had Professor Fraularm removed from his sight as he could take her screeching no longer. He agreed this would require further investigation, and he plans to present today’s findings to the Zent.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I’m told more Ehrenfest students than normal are visiting the library. Their classes should be mostly finished, however, so I can only assume Rozemyne has increased the payments for crest-certified work.</em>
</p><p>
<em>–Professor Hirschur</em>
</p><p>“This is getting too deep,” Sylvester said, cradling his head. “Why are we even involved in something like this? This is so far beyond what a middle-ranked duchy should be dealing with that I can’t even wrap my head around it! Is this really all happening just because Georgine wants to be aub? Rather than go through all this, why doesn’t she just kill her husband and take Ahrensbach’s foundation for herself and leave me and my kids out of it?!”</p><p>With a heavy sigh, Ferdinand tapped his temple and muttered, “The women in your family need little reason to be venomous and vindictive.”</p><p>“Hey! Constanze is fine!”</p><p>“Regardless,” Ferdinand said, “it appears the royal family will be handling the investigation from this point onward, so we can wash our hands of it.” And hopefully this time either Raublut would not make contact with Georgine, or his plan to use trug on the king would fail.</p><p>“Don’t forget about Traugott,” Karstedt said. “As long as he’s still alive, we’re still involved.”</p><p>“Yes, we will have the very minor role of prisoner transport. We will not be conducting any of the interrogation ourselves, so we will have little involvement.”</p><p>The more important question was how was Georgine going to react to so many of her plans being foiled. At what point would she stop pulling strings and decide to simply invade? With her minions dead, he had no idea how she would plan to take the key to the High Bishop’s bible, not that she would receive the real one even if she did. Would she bring an army of devouring soldiers, storm the temple, and search for the key herself? They already had silver cloth, though he doubted they had enough of it to cover an army. It was also unlikely that they’d already obtained the instant-death poison. Was that what she was waiting for?</p><p>He’d already resolved to complete his Wisdom during the interduchy tournament. Could he close the border gate to Lanzenave? That would alert everyone to the presence of someone with the Book of Mestinora, and the country would tear itself apart trying to find him. He didn’t think he could subdue the chaos his interference would cause. It seemed he would have to wait until he could install a fake zent. Of course, to do that, he would need to create a Grutrissheit magic tool, which would require 300 pages of the highest quality magic paper, and those had not come back with him. He was only given ingredients, not fabricated products.</p><p>Did Mestinora not realize her pettiness was actively hurting her precious Erwaermen? It would take so much longer to create the magic tool without that paper, meaning it would be longer still until Erwaermen had a zent to drain dry for his crumbling garden.</p><p>Ferdinand had slowly been purchasing the fey paper Rozemyne had used to create the sheets he needed in the past weave, but he was far from obtaining the amount he needed, and it was such a valuable learning experience for her and her scholars that he was loath to take the opportunity away from her. Still, if it meant stopping Lanzenave sooner… Maybe it would even help prevent Rozemyne’s fear of feystones from ever happening. Then again, if it sped up Georgine’s invasion, it might just cause her to develop the fear sooner.</p><p>Sometimes, it felt like his knowledge of the past weave was more of a curse than anything.</p><p> </p><p>A day after they received Hirschur’s letter, reports on the Drewanchel tea party arrived. It felt like they were reading about completely separate events rather than a single gathering.</p><p>
<em>Father,</em>
</p><p>
<em>We had the tea party with Drewanchel today. I don’t really like tea parties, but this one was fine because my friend Ortwin was forced to come by his older sister. We played gewinnen a couple of times, and we each won once. It was a really close game when I lost though, so I think I’m getting better! Let’s play when I get back! I bet I could beat you at least once this time!</em>
</p><p>
<em>After we finished, I got him to play karuta with me like we’d planned. I won, of course, but our game drew Lady Adolphine’s attention, and she got me to explain it to her. We all ended up playing a few games together, and we obliterated them the first three rounds, but it kept getting tougher and tougher. Lady Adolphine ended up winning a round towards the end. Ortwin got close, so I think he’ll be a really tough opponent next time. We’re already neck-in-neck in chess and reversi. It’s great having such a strong rival!</em>
</p><p>“You know, this. This right here. This is what I want to see,” Sylvester said, stabbing his finger into the letter as it rested on his desk. “Heartwarming moments of boyhood adventure and friendship. Not this nonsense about deadly feybeasts and conspiracies to topple thrones or whatever.”</p><p>Ferdinand sighed. “We’ve learned nothing of value from his report.”</p><p>“Nothing of value?!” he shouted. “Every word of this is dripping with value! Agh, why am I even wasting my breath on you. You’ll understand when you have kids.”</p><p>“I sincerely doubt that,” Ferdinand said with a frown.</p><p>Sylvester glanced over at Karstedt and held up three fingers. Karstedt frowned and held up four. They both nodded and shook hands.</p><p>“What was that?” Ferdinand asked.</p><p>“Nothing. You’ll understand when you have kids. Anyway, let’s look at Charlotte’s.”</p><p>
<em>Father,</em>
</p><p>
<em>I attended a wonderful tea party with two Drewanchel archduke candidates, but I had to be on my guard the entire time. Brother was so focused on trying to spread karuta that he didn’t notice the overtures Lady Adolphine and to a lesser extent Lord Ortwin were making. It would have been nice to have his assistance in deflecting them. Instead, he would say things like, “Yeah, my little sister is pretty amazing, right?” or “Yeah, any guy would be lucky to marry her.” At least he mentioned that I’m favored to be the next aub, so they’re under no illusions that I would be willing to move to Drewanchel.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Lady Adolphine was very interested in the picture books after we explained they were the other secret to our rising grades in addition to the karuta. It was a struggle to keep Sister from talking too much about books, but because of her, we were able to introduce Lady Adolphine to Royal Academy Love Stories, which she took an immediate interest in. She began asking me about my favorite love story from the novel, what would be my ideal confession, and other such obvious questions to gain intelligence for her little brother. I suppose there are worse candidates for marriage, though. He’s at least smart and gets along with Brother, but I’m afraid someone from the Third who has a chance to become the next aub is simply an option that does not exist.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Sister was able to come to my rescue during this line of questioning as she spoke at length about Uncle until Lady Adolphine changed the subject.</em>
</p><p>“Oh, she did, did she?” Sylvester asked in a teasing tone.</p><p>Ferdinand wished his hair hid his ears. “It was an obvious tactic to protect her little sister.”</p><p>Karstedt snorted but tried to mask it as a cough, which set Sylvester off. It was several long moments before they returned to the letter.</p><p>
<em>Lady Adolphine expressed her desire to befriend us, which we joyfully accepted. I believe she will have Aub Drewanchel contact you about the books we lent her, so please be prepared to speak with him.</em>
</p><p>
<em>–Your daughter, Charlotte</em>
</p><p>Everyone in the room could guess what Rozemyne’s letter focused on.</p><p>
<em>To my fiancé,</em>
</p><p>
<em>We had a tea party with Lady Adolphine and Lord Ortwin today. Just like we planned, we had Wilfried introduce Lord Ortwin to karuta, and they even got Lady Adolphine to play. I need to contact the Plantin company to get them to make as many decks as they can. These are going to sell out in seconds! The winter playroom will be a joke compared to how many decks we’ll sell to Drewanchel alone! We need to strike while the iron’s hot before they figure out how to mass produce them for themselves!</em>
</p><p>
<em>Lady Adolphine was enamored with the picture books and Royal Academy Love Stories. I knew she was a good person! I mentioned that we’re able to make many copies of books quickly, but like I said before, I hinted that perhaps a specially-developed magic circle was involved. That should delay their research for a while!</em>
</p><p>
<em>Unless they find a way to produce books with magic. If they do, perhaps we can get Lord Ortwin to marry Charlotte and steal the knowledge for ourselves. Lady Adolphine sure was interested in the idea, especially after she saw the books. She kept trying to dig for information on Charlotte’s romantic preferences, so I used a common tactic I picked up from one of the Gilberta Company merchants and droned on and on about you. She gave up pretty quick.</em>
</p><p>“See?” Ferdinand said, a smile of vindication on his lips.</p><p>“Yeah, yeah,” Sylvester said, waving him off. “Those words have to come from somewhere, though.”</p><p>“Perhaps she learned them from the story about a young boy relentlessly attempting to woo an older girl and being rejected time and time again.”</p><p>He shrugged, a roguish grin on his face. “Got her in the end, though, didn’t I?”</p><p>
<em>We discussed the printing industry, and I mentioned that it was a technology that was quickly expanding in Ehrenfest and that soon we would be a duchy of books! This seemed to greatly interest her as she immediately offered friendship with us.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I got Drewanchel on our side, just like you asked! I did an amazing job, right? You’re going to send me a letter praising my efforts, right? Or even better, you can tell me in person! Wait, no, I can read the letter as often as I want. Ah, but I really like hearing praise, too. Do both! Yes, both are absolutely necessary to keep my motivation up. I will not be able to complete any more tasks until I have both.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Anyway, big news. Lady Adolphine wants a hairpin for graduation, so I had Brunhilde take down the details for her. She doesn’t know who will escort her though, since she was supposed to marry the prince Princess Eglantine didn’t choose. Prince Anastasius is still chasing Princess Eglantine, even though she’s thoroughly rejected him, but I don’t think Prince Sigiswald has even talked to Lady Adolphine. I hope she can find a solution where she doesn’t have to marry either of them like Princess Eglantine did.</em>
</p><p>
<em>– Rozemyne</em>
</p><p>In the end, they were able to start spreading karuta and picture books before Ahrensbach had a chance to say a word about them, gain Drewanchel as an ally, and all but ensure Aub Drewanchel would come to their table to discuss the printing industry, giving Ahrensbach less opportunity to approach them and even less authority to wield over them. If one could shelter under the wings of the Second and Third, then the ramblings of the Sixth would be little more than a noisy breeze.</p><p>Rozemyne’s tea party with Eglantine happened two days before she was due to arrive back in Ehrenfest. Harmut was not allowed to attend given his gender, so the report came from Philine, who was doing her best to catch up.</p><p>
<em>Lord Ferdinand,</em>
</p><p>
<em>Lady Rozemyne met with Princess Eglantine for tea this afternoon. Of particular note was her delight with the mille crepes topped with honey in addition to her favored honey pound cake. She offered Lady Rozemyne a treat from Klassenberg and has agreed to send her some dried fruits and seasonings native to her homeland. Lady Rozemyne has promised to turn these into confections that she will present to her next year.</em>
</p><p>
<em>At this point, they turned on a sound-blocking tool, and I’m afraid I am not as good at reading lips as Hartmut. However, I was able to get the gist of what was said. Princess Eglantine expressed worry over Lady Adolphine’s situation and asked for Lady Rozemyne’s support. She gave a noncommittal answer. The only other thing I could glean was that Princess Eglantine spoke of Mestionora quite often.</em>
</p><p>
<em>From Philine</em>
</p><p>Rozemyne’s report came in two envelopes, one addressed to the aub and one addressed to him with a heart after his name, indicating it was to be read in his hidden room. The one to the aub more or less reiterated with Philine stated, though it left out the part about Mestionora.</p><p>When Ferdinand returned to his office later, he entered his hidden room, closed the curtains against the moonlight, and then opened the envelope from Rozemyne.</p><p>
<em>To my fiancé,</em>
</p><p>
<em>My conversation with Princess Eglantine was a little troubling. She said that since Lady Adolphine was meant to marry the prince she herself did not choose - in other words, the prince who would not become Zent - that she stood poised to possibly start another civil war. It seems many think that whoever she marries, the other will ascend the throne, meaning she’s in the exact same position as Princess Eglantine was last year.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Lady Adolphine did not seem to be under this impression, however, so I’m afraid this may escalate in ways we can’t predict.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Anyway, Princess Eglantine said she has a plan to circumvent the issue, and she asked for my support as her “incarnation of Mestionora” since it involves the library in some way. We’re in desperate need of allies, but I was afraid to commit to a plan she seemed unwilling to share, so I said, “As Dregarnuhr’s weave extends, I shall listen for Anhaltung and heed the wisdom of Mestionora that I might know how to pass Glucklitat’s trials.”</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand smirked at Rozemyne’s growth. She would never have been able to give such a beautifully empty answer in the last weave.</p><p>
<em>Ferdinand, I’m worried. It feels like I’m getting way too deep into something I shouldn’t even have my toes in. I’m doing my best to make alliances and avoid making enemies, but it’s like no matter what I do, everything becomes a super huge deal. Am I perhaps Glucklitat’s favorite or something?</em>
</p><p>
<em>I just want to read and eat lunch and dinner with you.</em>
</p><p>
<em>–Rozemyne</em>
</p><p>He penned her a quick response.</p><p>
<em>To my fiancée,</em>
</p><p>
<em>You did well considering the situation you found yourself in. It is indeed troubling, but you have little ability to move the gewinnen pieces that Princess Eglantine is playing with. Simply try to stay out of her way.</em>
</p><p>
<em>And you are not Glucklitat’s favorite. She instead enjoys testing me every single time I receive a letter from you.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I look forward to sharing meals with you as well once you return.</em>
</p><p>
<em>–Ferdinand</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Two days later, the archducal family and all their retainers waited in the teleportation chamber for Rozemyne to appear. Her things came first, and then the circle lit in the colors of the God of Darkness and the Goddess of Light. Before they faded, Ferdinand knew she had appeared.</p><p>Because he could sense her.</p><p>Their eyes met from across the room, both wide with shock. A strained moment passed before she flushed in Geduldh’s divine color. She covered her face and spun around, yelling something incomprehensible into her palms.</p><p>“My lady, whatever is the matter?” Rihyarda asked, trying to get Rozemyne to look at her, but the girl just shook her head violently, refusing to remove her hands.</p><p>“Oh my! Oh my! Oh my my my!” Elvira said, clapping her hands over her mouth as she nearly giggled in glee. She glided forward, put her hands on Rozemyne’s shoulders, and began whispering in her ear as Florencia started tittering.</p><p>After a moment, Sylvester snorted and clapped a hand over his mouth. Karstedt and Bonifatius looked less than amused. Eckhart mumbled, “That’s my little sister for you. No one else could stand by Lord Ferdinand.” Justus had long since braced himself against the wall as he tried to contain his laughter.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ferdinand once again wished his ears were covered by his hair as his frown began to deepen.</p><p>It took several long moments, but Elvira eventually coaxed Rozemyne into coming out of her shell again. Before the girl turned around, Elvira shot a vicious look at everyone in the room, killing their mirth instantly. At her mother’s urging, Rozemyne walked forward and offered greetings to everyone before she stopped in front of Ferdinand. She refused to meet his eye as he said, “Welcome home, Rozemyne.”</p><p>“S-so I have returned.” She then grabbed onto Elvira’s hand, and the two swiftly left the chamber, undoubtedly going to her hidden room for another lesson in ladies’ education. Florencia followed after them.</p><p>“Wow,” Sylvester said, stretching his arm. “I can’t even feel her the tiniest bit. You guys are really up there, huh? Gods, you two are adorable.”</p><p>“Sylvester?”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Shut up.”</p>

<p>Rozemyne eventually came out of her room with her noble smile fixed in place. He felt her approach his office and wondered when the last time he’d sensed someone was. Was it Rozemyne in the last weave? He certainly hadn’t sensed anyone since returning. It was still a strange sensation, one he hadn’t been used to for quite some time. He’d always associated it with painful memories, but after feeling Rozemyne for the first time, he’d begun to rewrite that connection. It hadn’t fully been changed, but he was making progress.</p><p>
<em>Twelve years since I last experienced her abuse, and still she lingers. How much longer will I let her have this power over me?</em>
</p><p>Rozemyne entered, pulling him from his thoughts. “Ferdinand, I would like to apologize for my unseemly behavior earlier.”</p><p>“Apology accepted. Now, come have a seat. We have much to discuss.”</p><p>She did as instructed, and he came around his desk and patted her on the head. “You did a good job with Drewanchel and Dunkelfelger, Rozemyne.”</p><p>Her entire face flushed, and her eyes became glassy as she started to fret. He removed his hand and gave her a quizzical look, but she just stared at the ground, covering her pink cheeks. She’d been so embarrassed to discover she could sense him. Perhaps she was embarrassed by touch as well? He supposed that meant she wouldn’t seek out any more hugs, which both relieved and saddened him.</p><p>He distanced himself from her, sitting down at his desk once again before activating the sound-blocking tool and commanding his people to turn around. Rozemyne noticed and did the same. “Now, let’s discuss the statue of Mestionora. You gave some mana to it, yes?” At her nod, he continued, “What I’m about to say cannot leave this chamber. It cannot be shared with anyone else. In fact, if we ever speak of it again, it will be within a hidden room. Is that clear?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“I believe it’s related to the shrines.”</p><p>Her eyes widened. “So why did Schwartz and Weiss direct me to give mana to the statue? I’ve been their master for a while now, and I visited the shrine a year ago. Nothing else has changed.”</p><p>Ferdinand tapped his temple. “What were you doing prior to that?”</p><p>“I was giving them mana like I always do.”</p><p>“Then is the answer not obvious? In offering them your mana, you passed some threshold that then allowed them to take you to the statue.”</p><p>She nodded, pressing a finger to her cheek. “So then who is Gramps?”</p><p>Sighing, Ferdinand asked, “Do you recall the tree that you received your divine will from?”</p><p>“Yes, it was rather beautiful.”</p><p>“That is Gramps.”</p><p>She tilted her head, but he didn’t elaborate further. Instead, he said, “Avoid donating any more mana to the statue. Now, let’s move on. I hear the music professors pressured you into playing a particular song for them. I would like to hear it.”</p><p>Rozemyne looked ready to refuse, then she plastered her noble smile in place. “Of course, but I will only sing it if all my guardians are in attendance, including both my mothers and fathers.”</p><p>A clever ploy to ensure she didn’t have to perform the song, but not only had she already debuted it at a tea party, she would also be the sole target of Sylvester’s teasing as both performer and composer. This was a game he’d played many times before, and he always played to win.</p><p>“Very well,” he said. “Three days from today. Will you be prepared?”</p><p>Her smile was bright as she said, “Of course. Please look forward to it.”</p><p>His was just as bright as he responded, “I certainly will. Now, we’ll need to schedule a meeting with Sylvester abs Elvira to discuss what we decided upon regarding the expansion of the printing industry to other duchies. Will you be available two days from now in the afternoon?”</p><p>“I should be.”</p><p>Ferdinand nodded then looked down, all traces of false joviality falling away. “Rozemyne, have you been able to sense anyone else?”</p><p>Her “Bwuh?!” confirmed he’d caught her off guard, and he was certain if he looked up, her face would be as red as it was in the teleportation chamber.</p><p>Eventually, she stammered out, “N-no, I h-haven’t.”</p><p>“I see. Good.” That meant the prince was out of her range, and he’d soon realize that fact as it became more and more obvious that she’d passed the point in puberty when one developed mana sensing. That should chase him off.</p><p>“Can you sense anyone else?” she asked hesitantly.</p><p>He shook his head. “Not for a while now.”</p><p>“So there really were no other options to begin with,” she muttered.</p><p>“Why?” he asked, his brows furrowing. “Do you desire other options?”</p><p>She soon her head, her midnight-blue hair whipping back and forth with the violent movement. “No! No! I was thinking that it was lucky we got engaged is all. It would have been kind of tragic if Sylvester engaged me to someone else only to discover I could sense you but not them.”</p><p>“Indeed,” he agreed, remembering his fear that she would choose to leave him to return to being a commoner if he’d been able to give her the choice. With her would go any chance of being part of the type of family he desired more than anything. It was selfish of him not to let her decide between returning to being a commoner or marrying him in this weave, but hadn’t she been the one to insist he learn to be selfish in the first place?</p><p>If that was what it took to keep her by his side, then selfish he would be.</p><p> </p><p>Rozemyne had immediately been inundated with meeting requests from the northern giebes, and rather than turn them down in this weave, she scheduled time to meet with every single one of them after the Dedication Ritual. It would delay her return to the Academy by a couple of days, but she felt it was a reasonable trade off.</p><p>The day of their meeting to discuss the printing industry, a note from Charlotte arrived, stating they would return the next day, quite a bit sooner than planned. Detlinde had been trying to invite her and Wilfried to a tea party while Rozemyne was away, but they were using the excuse of returning for the Dedication Ritual to avoid her.</p><p>“Well, it’s better to have no archduke candidate in the dormitory than to have to socialize with Lady Detlinde,” Rozemyne said after the announcement was made at the beginning of their meeting. “With our better grades, overall higher mana capacity, and the spread of the printing industry, I’m aiming to outstrip them in the rankings so we can tell them no instead of having to go through all this trouble just to avoid Ahrensbach.”</p><p>Sylvester paled, but Elvira took the opportunity to start the meeting in earnest. “Rozemyne, here is the plan for expansion into other duchies. Please review it.”</p><p>Her eyes flew over the words as she flipped through the pages. Once she reached the end, she jerked her head up with a gasp. “The legal deposit law! What happened to it?”</p><p>Elvira looked away while Sylvester scratched his head. In other words, they were leaving the explanation to Ferdinand. With a heavy sigh, he said, “Good grief, can you not see the problems that would come from establishing Ehrenfest as the official custodian of all printed material?”</p><p>“No, I can’t,” she said, setting the packet of papers down and crossing her arms. “We started the industry. Without us - without <em>me</em> - there would be no printed materials in the first place. If they don’t want to abide by the legal deposit law, then they don’t get to have access to my proprietary technology.”</p><p>“Fool, if printed materials are collected anywhere, it should be in the Sovereignty in the Palace Library.”</p><p>“And can anyone visit the Palace Library?”</p><p>“Of course not.”</p><p>She smiled as if she’d just won the argument. “Then it can’t function as a proper repository for books. Books need to be available to everyone. Reading is a fundamental human right. To limit access to printed materials is to infringe upon that right. In fact, I would go so far as to say… I… I really need those books!”</p><p>“So your true motive comes out,” he sighed.</p><p>“Please,” She begged, tears in her eyes, “at least keep the part about the Saint of Ehrenfest getting copies! You can do that much for me, can’t you, after I so graciously gave the industry I created from nothing to the duchy? This is like my child. No, it is my child! Why are you trying to take my child away from me?!”</p><p>“Fool!” Ferdinand barked. “Control yourself, or has all the time I spent doing your work in addition to my own so that you might train with Elvira been wasted?”</p><p>That brought her up short, but only for a moment. “I won’t agree to it!” she declared, crossing her arms in a pout.</p><p>He felt a vein begin to bulge in his forehead. “It is fortunate, then, that this is a duchy industry, not a personal one, so your agreement is not necessary.”</p><p>She gasped and stared at him as though he’d committed some unforgivable act of betrayal.</p><p>“Perhaps we can add a clause allowing Ehrenfest to purchase any book printed as you originally suggested at the previous meeting, Lord Ferdinand,” Elvira said, obviously having had enough of the argument.</p><p>Rozemyne frowned but at least looked contemplative. “Make it two copies. I still want one for myself. It’s why I started the industry in the first place.”</p><p>“Where do you even intend to keep all these books?” Sylvester asked.</p><p>“In the library my fiancé so graciously agreed to give me upon our Star Binding.”</p><p>Ferdinand sighed. “It is a sizable room, but it will soon run out of space if the industry grows as quickly as we suspect it will.”</p><p>With a shrug, she said, “Then we can line the bedroom walls with bookshelves. There’s no better decor, anyway.”</p><p>Ferdinand refused to sleep in a glorified library, but that was an argument they could save for another time. Once they reestablished Alexandria, it would be a moot point since she would undoubtedly create a massive library in the center of the city.</p><p>“Two books, then,” Elvira said as she made a note on the paper. “Anything else?”</p><p>Rozemyne nodded. “I would like to meet with the Plantin Company before we enter into negotiations with any other duchies. We’ll need to discuss how realistic it is to send craftspeople to far away duchies to train their people in printing and paper-making. I would like Otto from the Gilberta Company’s opinion as well since he used to be a traveling merchant and knows more than anyone what doing business in another duchy is like. We’ll also need to add something about allowing me to bring my Gutenbergs in my highbeast. Even if they send craftspeople to train here over the winter, we’ll still need to send representatives of the Plantin Company to establish Printing and Paper Guilds, and I have no intention of letting my people travel across dangerous lands unprotected.”</p><p>“Why would they send their craftspeople here over the winter?” Elvira asked. “Would those from a warm region like Dunkelfelger not suffer considerably from our much colder weather?”</p><p>“We simply don’t have the space to house craftspeople along with all the other merchants that will be coming during the summer. Not to mention, it’s much easier for craftspeople to be away from their workshops over winter when orders slow down and they begin to focus on winter handiwork.”</p><p>“I see,” Sylvester said with a pleased nod. “So all those fancy inns we have can expect to have business year round if we put the burden on travel on the other duchies instead of having you fly your people all over the country. It might be a hard sell, so you’ll need to prepare your Gutenbergs to be ready for either eventuality.”</p><p>With that, the meeting finally concluded.</p><p> </p><p>Wilfried and Charlotte arrived the next morning, both glad to have escaped Detlinde and to see their parents. Within moments of greeting her siblings, Rozemyne told them about the performance she would be giving that afternoon, which was Ferdinand’s first clue that something was amiss.</p><p>His second hint came at the end of lunch when she asked, “The time-stopping magic tools aren’t still in the library, are they?”</p><p>The third occurred just before the performance began. She settled herself at the front of the relatively small chamber, offering a peaceful smile to her gathered family members and the retainers in the room. When her eyes met Ferdinand’s, however, the smile morphed into a wicked smirk for the briefest moment. It was far too late by then to stop the trap he’d sprung three days before.</p><p>She strummed a beautiful melody, sweet and upbeat, the notes trailing up and down the scale like a small stream trickling down a short fall.</p><p>Then she began to sing, and it was all he could do not to cover his face with his hands and groan in embarrassment.</p><p>
<em>Verbergen must hide my heart but<br/>
I can say it in Schlaftraum’s dream<br/>
Though I know we must be apart<br/>
I want to see you desperately</em>
</p><p>
<em>Dregarnuhr is slow in weaving<br/>
Anwachs holds back his blessing<br/>
How can I wait for my Dark God<br/>

</p><p>
<em>As my Dark God’s cape covers the sky<br/>

</p><p>
<em>Steifebrise, speed Dregarnuhr’s weave<br/>

</p><p>He knew when she’d sung the line about being brought to Ehrenfest by the gods that this was the song she’d refused to give the prince. He would be lying to himself if he said the words didn’t move him, but the embarrassment far outweighed everything else.</p><p>By the time the last note played, Elvira was frantically waving her schtappe in the air, and Florenica had a wistful smile on her face. Karstedt was trying his best to keep a polite smile on his face, though his eyebrows twitched and the corners of his lips kept threatening to pull down.</p><p>Once Rozemyne stepped out of the room, Sylvester finally let out the laughter he was holding back and slapped Ferdinand on the back several times. After the fifth hit, he glared at his older brother and said, “Touch me one more time, and you will lose that arm.”</p><p>“Fine, fine!” Sylvester wheezed, turning to his son who had his face in his hands. “Wilfried! What’d you think of the performance?”</p><p>Wilfried lifted his face just enough to say, “Please don’t talk to me. I’m too embarrassed to say anything.”</p><p>“Sister truly is…passionate about the things she likes, isn’t she?” Charlotte said, her eyes and smile wavering.</p><p>“Is that not one of the most romantic things you've ever heard?” Elvira asked no one in particular. “Ah, the story of a young girl in love, desperately longing for her dark god! It’s enough to send your heart aflutter and move you to tears, is it not?”</p><p>Florencia nodded. “Indeed it is. It reminds me of some of the songs Sylvester used to sing to me when we were still in the Royal Academy.”</p><p>“Mother!” Wilfried and Charlotte cried.</p><p>“Hey, now!” Sylvester yelled, his laughter instantly dying. “No need to bring up ancient history, now, is there?”</p><p>Ignoring all of them, Ferdinand stood and strode towards the door, preparing a bone-chilling lecture for his little gremlin. Unsurprisingly, he found Justus moments from collapsing to the floor as he held his stomach with a hand clapped over his mouth. Eckhart looked proud, but he was always one to take away the wrong message. Janrik was staring off to the side, avoiding eye contact, a light blush crawling up his neck.</p><p>Before Ferdinand could reach the door, Sylvester called out, “Hey, I understand being moved by that performance, but remember autumn is still a long way away!”</p><p>He glared at his brother before marching out of the room. Justus got control of himself long enough to send an ordonnanz to his mother asking for Rozemyne’s whereabouts and learned she was in the northern building. Fortunately, Sylvester hadn’t yet revoked Ferdinand’s permission to enter, so he wasted no time in going to her rooms and having Eckhart knock on her door. When he entered, she looked up from the papers on her desk and gave him a noble smile. “Ferdinand,” she said, “whatever brings you here?”</p><p>He all but threw the sound-blocking tool on the desk. She glanced down at it, back up at him, then turned to her retainers. “I’ll have to ask for a moment of your understanding. There are some things that simply cannot risk being said in the presence of non-archduke candidates.” As she got to her feet, Cornelius began protesting, but she glared at him and asked, “Shall I tell Mother about what you do with Leonore in the gazebo?”</p><p>His face blanched as Leonore turned dark red. “Y-you can’t possibly…!”</p><p>Eyes glittering with triumph, Rozemyne said, “Oh, so there <em>is</em> some truth to my theory. A word to the wise, dear Brother, those who protest the loudest are often the guiltiest.” She then all but dragged Ferdinand into her hidden room and slammed the door shut. It only took a few moments before the light began to flash, but she ignored it and instead walked over to a large box on her desk. “I want you to have this,” she said. “I’ve been working on it for a while, but I think it’s finally ready.”</p><p>Ferdinand narrowed his eyes at her, recognizing the ploy for what it was. While he wanted to chastise her for shamelessly singing that song in front of everyone, his eyes kept being drawn to the box. Whatever it was, she believed it impressive enough to save her from a severe scolding. Just how far ahead did she plan her revenge for putting the time-stopping magic tools in the library?</p><p>With a defeated sigh, he stepped forward, took off the cloth hiding the bribe, and froze.</p><p>The box itself was made of panes of glass slotted into a metal frame, designed to let light inside. The lid was similarly constructed, though the bottom was nothing more than wooden slats, no doubt meant to allow excess water to filter out. Inside nestled in the rich soil that filled the bottom of the box was a gently glowing golden sprout roughly two handspans tall.</p><p>“Rozemyne,” he gasped, peering down at the plant in awe, “is this…?”</p><p>She nodded. “A blenrus tree. You got one of the fruits Giebe Haldenzel gave me, but I’ve been using the other to try to cultivate it. You made me agree to give you my mana for future plant experimentation, and with the Haldenzel miracle, I figured it was worth a shot. I went through nearly all of the seeds before I got one to take.”</p><p>His mind spun with all the implications of her experiment. “How? What did you do? What was the process? Did you have any controls? What finally worked? What else did you try? Is this the only sample that produced results? Do you have any seeds left?”</p><p>“Slow down,” she giggled. “I can only answer one question at a time. I can tell you that just planting the seeds and pouring my mana into them didn’t work. However, when I offered prayers to all the goddesses of spring, it sprouted the next day. I had tried just Verdrenna before, but it didn’t produce any results. I didn’t have enough seeds to go through each subordinate goddess one by one, so I don’t know which of them is responsible or if all of them are. Still amazing, though, right?” As she finished her explanation, she puffed out her chest and gave a self-satisfied chuckle.</p><p>“Fascinating,” he murmured, looking the plant over and pushing just a little of his mana into it to check it. It was indeed filled with her mana, and he wondered if the fruit it bore also would be. Would it even bear fruit? How long would it take for it to reach maturity? “When did this seed finally sprout?”</p><p>“About midway through summer. It was so tiny for so long. Most of the growth has occurred since the dying competition.”</p><p>He furrowed his brows at her. “Why since then?”</p><p>Blushing, she said, “Well, a certain someone ordered a hairpin for me that matched the cloth of my future Renaissance, and you know how my emotions lend themselves to blessings, so…”</p><p>“So you poured them into a blessing that made it grow faster?” he asked, stunned. This girl who loved reading and cared nothing at all for research that had nothing to do with libraries had spent <em>months</em> experimenting with her limited resources to give him something so precious. He almost offered his own prayers to the gods, but he barely managed to reign himself back in. “I see. This is… This is truly wonderful. Very fine work indeed.”</p><p>She bounced on her toes several times before she slammed into him, wrapping her arms around him and giggling to herself as she repeated his words of praise. He returned the tight embrace, once again shocked by how much she’d grown. She would physically be thirteen in a mere two seasons, so it shouldn’t have surprised him that she now nearly reached the middle of his chest.</p><p>As pleasant as the hug was, however, the light was getting more and more insistent. “Rozemyne, we should leave now.”</p><p>“Aw, fine,” she said, puffing out her cheeks. As she turned to the door, he quickly threw the cloth covering over the glass box and lifted it with a slight grunt. Had Rozemyne been able to carry this by herself? Just how far along was her enhancement training coming?</p><p>When they stepped outside, the suspicious eyes turned understanding as they caught sight of the large box in his arms. They obviously assumed it contained something related to the archduke candidate course or similar. Though she wasn’t enrolled in it yet, everyone knew she was studying far above her grade level, so it was a likely explanation.</p><p>Ferdinand bade Rozemyne goodbye and hurried down the halls to his office where he immediately entered his hidden room and threw himself into researching the blenrus sprout.</p><p>It was only once he was on his way to the temple for the Dedication Ritual that he realized how thoroughly he’d been manipulated.</p>

<h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
<p>The Dedication Ritual ended just as quickly as the year before, so the children spent their remaining time socializing. Rozemyne focused on telling all the northern giebes how everyone was searching for information on the stages that were demolished and preparing for Melchior’s baptism in the spring. Wilfried took his guard knights out to train once he visited his little brother, and Charlotte made her rounds in various social circles, establishing the connections that would support her as aub.</p><p>After they returned, Sylvester, Karstedt, and Ferdinand waited for either a headache-inducing report from one of their archduke candidates or a summons from royalty, but neither ever came. The children mostly continued socializing with the upper duchies with occasional visits from lower duchies. There was one party that included First through Sixth, and though Detlinde started to insult Rozemyne for her upbringing in the temple, Dunkelfelger and Drewanchel were quick to step in and silence her with the Klassenberg archnoble expressing admiration for Ehrenfest keeping the old ways alive. The participants then went on to discuss their amazement at Wilfried’s and Rozemyne’s ability to summon divine instruments and the healing ritual that restored the Ehrenfest gathering spot. Ferdinand was exceptionally pleased to find out that Charlotte had refused to extend a hand to her cousin this time, instead opting to ignore her as much as possible.</p><p>The peaceful days continued into the interduchy tournament. When Ferdinand arrived, he greeted the archduke candidate and then immediately moved to see the scholars’ research. Hartmut’s secondary research was on prayers, the healing ritual, and the magic circle that appeared in the Ehrenfest gathering grounds. His main topic was also related to magic circles, namely combining multiple elements that traditionally were not used together. It seemed he’d gleaned quite a lot from the use of the life element in Schwartz and Weiss.</p><p>Wilfried’s and Charlotte’s scholars were not as exemplary as Hartmut, but they were still so much improved from last weave as to be unrecognizable. Overall, Ferdinand saw no need to worry about their standing in this regard.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, he ordered Justus to start directing the scholars, Eckhart the knights, and Janrik the attendants. This allowed all of the archducal family to gather without distraction. They decided to divide themselves into three groups: Ferdinand and Rozemyne, Sylvester and Charlotte, and Florencia and Wilfried. When it came time to start discussing the printing industry, Sylvester would join Ferdinand and Rozemyne.</p><p>The plan made, Rozemyne gave the knights Angriff’s blessing, and then they went to their tables. They had several visitors after their sweets, new and old, most of whom also asked about the karuta cards and picture books. Those from the latter group were sent to Sylvester</p><p>It seemed no time at all when the crowds froze and parted, giving way to Princess Eglantine and Aub Drewanchel. It seemed they were about to witness the culmination of her plan for Adolphine.</p><p>As they approached, Ferdinand noticed she was wearing a hairpin decorated with red koralies. So she’d accepted a gift from Prince Anastasius and chose to wear it at such a public event. Given she was not being escorted by the prince, Ferdinand didn’t think they were in any form of romantic relationship. However, it still made him wonder if some things were simply fated to be.</p><p>They sat across from Ferdinand and Rozemyne, exchanging greetings and pleasantries as treats were distributed and taste tested. Not too long after, the princess erected a sound-blocking barrier and said, “Lady Rozemyne, as one blessed by Mestionora, I hoped you would serve as Anhaltung for Aub Drewanchel and myself. To that end, we have come to hear about the Royal Academy Library, specifically the benefits of having a third archnoble librarian.”</p><p>Ah, so that was her plan. Ferdinand sat back and listened to Rozemyne list several of the tools that were not operational because of a lack of personnel, the burden on both the Royal Academy and Palace libraries from the lack of arch librarians able to travel between them, and the impact on general operations. Then, she began to speak about the Underground Archive as described to her by the librarians and the diaries she’d borrowed this term. Aub Drewanchel perked up at that, interjecting, “So you mean to tell me no one has had access to that archive since the civil war?”</p><p>“No, as Professor Solange was alone until this past year.”</p><p>The aub held his chin and hummed to himself before raising a brow and turning his attention to Ferdinand. “I’m sure you understand keeping all the knowledge inside that archive from the archnobles and archduke candidates of the younger generations could have a significant impact on the future.”</p><p>“Indeed,” he agreed.</p><p>“This may explain many of our current shortcomings. They cannot be solely blamed on the lacking curriculum.” Nodding to himself, Aub Drewanchel said, “This needs to be addressed immediately. I will need to go speak with a few others, but I intend to return to discuss this new industry you spoke of to my children.”</p><p>“We will look forward to our threads crossing again.”</p><p>Their visitors left only to be soon replaced by Aub Dunkelfelger, his daughter, and a group of rowdy knights. “Lady Rozemyne!” the aub barked. “Dear friend of my daughter! I’m told this is your work?” He slapped the massive stack of papers on the table.</p><p>Rozemyne gave them a brief glance before nodding. “Yes, that is my translation of your enthralling history. Were any mistakes found? I am concerned with preserving the authenticity of the original text. I would hate to misrepresent any aspect of your impressive history.”</p><p>The aub snorted, though his eyes danced with amusement. “No errors that we noticed. It’s beautifully written. Now, I’m told you want to publish this as a book in Ehrenfest using this new technology you’ve boasted to my children about?”</p><p>“Yes, I would appreciate the opportunity to do so given the time, effort, and expense I went to in creating the translation.”</p><p>He paused, raising an eyebrow. “Why go through all that to print a Dunkelfelgerian book in Ehrenfest?”</p><p>“Why, should not everyone be able to read something so wonderful as a book detailing your long and rich history?” Rozemyne asked, tilting her head and placing a hand on her cheek.</p><p>“Hmmm…” The aub crossed his arms and sat down, taking the rohre-flavored pound cake and waiting for the taste test to be concluded before he ate some himself. He stared down at the confection with some surprise before grinning and nodding his approval. Hannelore beside him was likewise enjoying a slice.</p><p>“It truly is a shame,” he said. “We cannot simply hand over rights to something as valuable as this.”</p><p>Rozemyne nodded. “I understand. Naturally, I also cannot merely hand over something I’ve invested at least 18 large gold in creating.”</p><p>Hannelore and Aub Dunkelfelger nearly choked on their food. “18 large gold?!” Hannelore gasped. “Who spends that kind of money on their hobbies?”</p><p>Smiling sweetly at her friend, Rozemyne replied, “I will spare no expense when it comes to books.”</p><p>“No expense, huh?” Aub Dunkelfelger asked. “Unfortunately, I’m not interested in gold. There is only one means to get exactly what you want in Dunkelfelger.”</p><p>Ferdinand raised his eyebrows. “I believe the agreement last year was that you could not challenge us this year.”</p><p>“And so I am not,” he grinned, leaning back in his seat with his arms crossed as Hannelore sighed. It seemed the first wife was at least aware of his actions this time. “Of course,” the aub continued, “we made no such agreements regarding <em>you</em> challenging <em>us</em>.”</p><p>“Oh my,” Rozemyne said, placing a hand on her cheek. “What would the stakes even be?”</p><p>“You win, you get publishing rights. We win, we get publishing rights.”</p><p>With a nod, she summoned Sylvester over, and they gave him a quick summary of their discussion so far. He and Rozemyne held sound-blocking tools as they held a short discussion. Then, Sylvester and Aub Dunkelfelger went back and forth for a bit before the former patted Rozemyne’s shoulder and gave her a nod.</p><p>Nor a moment later, Rozemyne had placed a sound-blocking tool in Ferdinand’s hand and forced him to curl his fingers around it, holding his hand closed for good measure. “My dearest fiancé-“</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Her smile brightened. “I will bless your sprout every day for a week.”</p><p>He remained silent.</p><p>“Two weeks.”</p><p>“Three weeks, you bless or offer mana to three of my other feyplant experiments, and you introduce me to this feyplant that only commoners know about.”</p><p>She chuckled and said, “My, you must be able to win this completely by yourself. I shouldn’t have to call out my highbeast or use my shield if I’m giving up so much.”</p><p>When he stared at her in response, she countered, “Either reduce it to two weeks or one extra plant. Take your pick.”</p><p>Ferdinand furrowed his brows as he considered which would be more valuable to him. Eventually, he said, “Two weeks, but get some ingredients out of them. Also, note that my plan relies heavily on the training you’ve been undergoing with Bonifatius and Judithe. This is for your publishing rights, after all. It’s only reasonable that you would play a role in our victory.”</p><p>“Aub Dunkelfelger,” Rozemyne said, putting away the tool, “how about we add a couple of items to the stakes?”</p><p>Not long after that, Sylvester was waving to them as they flew to Dunkelfelger’s ditter field. Ferdinand sighed as he stared down at it, wondering again if some things were just fated to be no matter what actions he took. If so, why did one of those things have to be ditter?</p><p>When they landed, Rozemyne once again gave Ferdinand three of her charms, though he was reluctant to take them given what might still occur later that day. He could recharge them, but then he would be far from full strength in the afternoon.</p><p>Well, if things went according to plan, then it wouldn’t matter. “You understand what needs to be done?” he asked, handing her a few tools.</p><p>She nodded and then went to their base. “I’ll give you the blessing as soon as I finish the shield, ok?”</p><p>Ferdinand mounted his highbeast and met Heisshitze in the air. When the ditter bell rang, Ferdinand threw an exploding magic tool at Heisshitze, who dodged and fired a shot at Rozemyne. She’d already spoken the spell knights used for their shields, having expected the same tactic as last time. One of her charms activated, shooting a counter that Heisshitze barely had time to block.</p><p>Ferdinand took advantage of that moment to throw another exploding magic tool at him. This time catching him square in the back. He was distracted long enough for Rozemyne to put up her shield and give Ferdinand a blessing before she set to work on their plan.</p><p>In this weave, Ferdinand had been undergoing training with the knights for a couple of years, so he was in much better shape. The addition of Angriff’s blessing only made it easier for him to block Heisshitze’s attacks and counter with his own. Even so, his goal wasn’t to overpower him but to keep him engaged, so he refrained from pressing his advantage and merely bided his time.</p><p>Suddenly, their audience erupted as a shrill cry echoed from across the field. Ferdinand smiled, and as Heisshitz turned to see what the commotion was, Aub Dunkelfelger called the game. At that instant, Rozemyne rushed across the field and healed her friend, apologizing all the while.</p><p>“What happened?!” Heisshitze yelled.</p><p>The observers all tried to explain at the same time, but it was eventually possible to piece together what had occurred. Rozemyne had been training to fire small projectiles from her water gun, having discovered through accident that she could slip something small down the barrel and send it flying across long distances if she used what she called a suction cup arrow.</p><p>For this game, she used a magic tool that created a barrier that would suddenly expand to various sizes depending on the amount of mana that was poured into it during its creation. As soon as Heisshitz turned away from her, Rozemyne loaded her water gun, stepped to the edge of her circle, held the weapon just outside the shield, and fired it at her friend. Her aim wasn’t as exceptional as Judithe’s, but the barrier was almost twice as large as the base, so since it landed fairly close, Hannelore was still violently shoved out of bounds.</p><p>“I can’t believe he had his treasure attack ours!” one of the spectators yelled.</p><p>“What a dirty trick!” shouted another.</p><p>“That’s exactly what I came to see! I love it!” cried a third.</p><p>Ferdinand smirked at Heisshitz and said, “Once again, you have focused solely on training your body and neglected your mind. As long as you continue to do so, you shall never prevail against me.” With that, Ferdinand flew over to where Rozemyne was talking with Hannelore and beckoned her to follow.</p><p>They returned to the dorms where Rozemyne unnecessarily healed him before he waschened himself, returned her protective charms, and put away his feystone armor. “Rozemyne, take a potion to restore the mana you spent,” he said, taking out his own.</p><p>“But why?” she asked. “I didn’t use that much.”</p><p>“Have you forgotten about Ahrensbach? Your enemies are about, so you must keep in top form to minimize any weaknesses they might exploit.”</p><p>Once she’d taken her potion, they returned to the interduchy tournament where they found Aubs Dunkelfelger and Ehrenfest deep in discussions, Charlotte silently observing. Ferdinand and Rozemyne joined them where the latter helped drive a tough negotiation, somehow getting Aub Dunkelfelger to agree to the legal deposit law in the process.</p><p>When their guest left, Rozemyne held her translation to her chest and sent both adults a smug smirk. It quickly turned into a polite smile as the crowds once again froze and parted to reveal a member of royalty.</p><p>Prince Anastasius sat at their table, exchanged greetings, and took some mille crepes that he topped with rumtopf. Then, he ordered the children to leave as he erected a sound-blocking barrier. The prince looked to Ferdinand and said, “So you’re the infamous fiancé I’ve heard much about, both from Rozemyne and the legends being passed around the Academy.”</p><p>Ferdinand felt his smile tighten. “Legends and young women in spring are wont to exaggerate.”</p><p>Anastasius snorted. “Quite. I found Ehrenfest’s crude research on the healing ritual and magic circle at your gathering spot intriguing.”</p><p>“It is our hope that presenting these results will lead others into replenishing their own gathering spots,” Sylvester replied.</p><p>“We shall see if any heed your attempts at playing Anhaltung and what results they achieve. Dregarnuhr is weaving swiftly, so let us discuss more important matters. Those of fallen houses seem to be standing against those of us in the highest heights once again, and they seem just as keen to set their sights on the Tenth. As such, Ordoschnelli must continue to fly between us.”</p><p>Sylvester crossed his arms over his chest and gave a slight bow. “We shall move as Zent and the prince command.”</p><p>Anastasius nodded. “The Knight’s Order will be dispatched to investigate the cause of the incident that threatened to bring much disfortune to you.”</p><p>Which meant Raublut was soon to make contact with Georgine.</p><p>“I will have what I need to question this Traugott in the coming days. Be prepared for my summons. Now in regards to what was sent through Rozemyne, my scholars confirmed your findings. My family has been warned, and we are now able to recognize the scent. However, we did not have enough for our retainers, so we require more.”</p><p>So there was a chance Raublut still didn’t know about it. Ferdinand was not about to change that. “My apologies, but I’m afraid I delivered to you all that I had left after performing my research.”</p><p>Anastasius wore a displeased frown. “I see. It was a rather sizable sample you sent. Very well, then. We shall have the Knight’s Order waschen all of their comrades as they return from their investigations. Now, I have other places to be. Be mindful of Chaocioher’s movements and Dregarnuhr’s tricks.” With that, he left.</p><p>Soon after, it came time for Ehrenfest to compete in ditter, so they made their way to the front to watch. Unlike last weave, Professor Gundolf was the one to summon their feybeast, not Fraularm. As such, the apprentice knights finished their battle in record time, ranking much higher than before.</p><p>Once they took their seats again, Aub Drewanchel found them, so after Sylvester and Charlotte joined them, they entered into negotiations. Once again, Rozemyne somehow extracted a promise to follow the legal deposit law from the aub. Ferdinand should have never underestimated her negotiation skills. This was the girl who’d convinced royalty to personally check he’d received a hidden room in Ahrensbach a year before his scheduled starbind, after all.</p><p>After that, Hartmut introduced Rozemyne to Clarissa, and she understood the significance of the act this time. She handled the exchange with aplomb, even with transcriptions of books being involved, and once again promised to take the girl as her retainer upon her starbinding.</p><p>Raimund could not be summoned over this time given the circumstances, so Philine acted as a go-between, delivering messages and documents on their behalf. In the end, Raimund was again tasked with creating a magic tool that would prevent people from leaving a library with books they didn’t check out, though Rozemyne added the stipulation that offenders should receive something of a shock as a painful reminder to respect the library. Ferdinand couldn’t fathom what had changed this weave to make her more ruthless than before, but he found he didn’t mind.</p><p>This year, because Rozemyne didn’t have to preserve her stamina, she was able to go with the others to the arena grounds, meaning when the archnoble from Immerdink threw a feystone at Hartmut in his envy-fueled rage, he didn’t inadvertently attack Rozemyne. He still missed, however. The stone clattered harmlessly across the ground. Most who noticed it assumed it had been carelessly dropped from one of the dozens of highbeasts flying overhead as students prepared for the awards ceremony.</p><p>Royalty entered, though this time Eglantine did not join them, instead staying with the other Klassenberg professors. As the king gave his opening speech, pillars of fire exploded around the arena. The guard knights instantly pulled out their shields and surrounded the archducal couple. Ferdinand looked to where the Ehrenfest students were and saw three rings of apprentice guard knights surrounding the archduke candidates. As more explosions rang out, Rozemyne’s dome-shaped shield appeared, covering nearly the entire area reserved for their students. The ones left outside the circle quickly moved inside it.</p><p>Suddenly, a second dome, considerably smaller than the first, appeared. Ferdinand enhanced his eyesight and saw Wilfried at its center, beckoning students from duchies whose viewing areas were engulfed in flames inside. Charlotte followed suit soon after, though hers was even smaller than her brother’s and could only hold maybe half a dozen outside of her own retinue of guard knights.</p><p>The first ternisbefallen fell, and as panicked students began to attack it, Ferdinand sent an ordonnanz to Aub Dunkelfelger, asking him to request permission to use black weapons. It wasn’t until the second ternisbefallen appeared that the aub’s booming voice rang out across the field as the Sovereign Knight’s Order attacked the feybeast closer to the royal family.</p><p>The moment the king granted his permission, Ferdinand and the Ehrenfest Knight’s Order imbued their blades with darkness just as a third ternisbefallen was dropped into the middle of the audience close by. A few of their knights attacked, and a small contingent of Dunkelfelger knights soon joined them.</p><p>Ferdinand spun around just in time to see another of the feybeasts fall amongst the Immerdink students who hadn’t taken shelter in Rozemyne or Wilfried’s shields and begin wreaking havoc. “Eckhart!” he barked as he produced his highbeast and flew down, charging his sword with mana.</p><p>By the time he arrived, Rozemyne had directed her knights to start pulling the closest Immerdink students to safety. “Karstedt!” Ferdinand called, and as their knight commander responded, Ferdinand yelled for Heisshitz to prioritize speed over caution as the enemy was trying to delay them as long as possible.</p><p>Just as Karstedt approached, the Dunkelfelger knights changed tactics, charging their weapons as they prepared themselves against the shockwave that would come from three full-strength attacks meeting at the same time. “Brace yourselves!” Ferdinand called, and then he along with Eckhart and Karstedt launched their attacks, killing the beast and knocking the surrounding students off their feet.</p><p>This time because he’d warned Dunkelfelger, the remaining ternisbefallens were dealt with quickly. However, since he wasn’t injured, he wasn’t with Rozemyne when the former Wrekestock nobles charged the king, dropping more ternisbefallens along the way. Since Eglantine wasn’t among the royal family, it was Sigiswald’s fwife who moved in front with her shield, being the most expendable among the family.</p><p>As Raublut stepped in to slaughter the attackers, Ferdinand sped towards Rozemyne, yelling for Charlotte to look away just as the fist of the bodies started to swell. He landed between his fiancé and the stage and wrapped her in his cloak, protecting her from the sight. When the first corpse exploded and the nearby students began gagging, Rozemyne clung to him, burying her face in his chest and covering her ears. In the previous weave, she’d simply held Charlotte’s hand with a grim if frightened expression. It seemed that since she didn’t feel the need to project the confidence of an older sister, she could allow herself to be weak. He wrapped an arm around her and pulled her closer, taking advantage of everyone’s distraction and the cape obscuring his actions to comfort her.</p><p>Once all the traitors and feybeasts were dealt with, Ferdinand released Rozemyne, who immediately lowered her shield and started moving to heal those most grievously wounded nearby, most being from Immerdink.</p><p>“Flutrane first!” Ferdinand instructed her. She nodded and got to work. When she finished with them, she headed for the next closest group that consisted of students largely from the eighth and ninth. Wilfried followed her example, but Charlotte remained with the Ehrenfest students, having nearly exhausted her mana holding her shield against the shockwave of his, Eckhart’s, and Karstedt’s attack. Unwilling to let her siblings outperform her, however, she drank her second potion of the day and got to work healing the Ehrenfest students.</p><p>Not all of the duchies had people with serious injuries, and many had quickly mobilized to carry their wounded to their dormitories to be treated. However, Wilfried and Rozemyne still managed to heal several dozen of the most grievously wounded, even tending to some amongst the audience. When he caught Rozemyne chugging her third potion of the day, he went to her side and stopped her from doing anything more. “They have their own means of healing,” he told her when she began to protest. “There is no reason for you to push yourself this far, unless you’re looking for an excuse not to participate in the awards ceremony.”</p><p>She reluctantly agreed to return to where the Ehrenfest students were gathered along with Wilfried. From there, the ceremony continued with even more of Ehrenfest’s students being named honor students than before, Rozemyne’s attendants among them. Ferdinand recalled that they hadn’t been able to achieve satisfactory grades due to earning negative marks each time their mistress collapsed.</p><p>Once again, Rozemyne was named first in class, and when she beamed her brilliant smile at him, Ferdinand resolved to praise her in the manner of his father once they returned to the temple.</p>

<h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
<p>Ferdinand was surprised Sylvester wasn’t summoned by the king after the awards ceremony. The king had wanted Rozemyne to perform the blessing during graduation last weave in order to put the Sovereign Temple and its biblical fundamentalists in their place after the attack. He couldn’t fathom what had changed his mind this time. The main differences that would have any effect on him all involved Anastasius, so perhaps the prince had talked him down. Then again, without the inquiry into the high bishop’s bible, it was possible the Saint of Ehrenfest simply wasn’t as prevalent in the king’s mind. Whatever the reason, they were able to return in peace.</p><p>The mood in the dormitory was subdued compared to the year before, but the praise all the honor students received was just as heartfelt. It made Ferdinand long for those six sleepless nights spent in the company of his father. He wished he could offer a similar experience to Rozemyne as there were few memories he cherished more. Instead, he would give her a few words and send her to spend a night alone in silence rather than basking in the joy of someone else’s pride as she talked the bells away.</p><p>After speaking with Sylvester and Florencia, Rozemyne bounded over to him, her eyes sparkling as she said, “I came first in class again!” with her chest puffed out.</p><p>He chuckled and said, “Yes, very fine work indeed.”</p><p>Her cheeks flushed as a shameless grin spread across her face. That wouldn’t do at all. He hit her behind his sleeve and hissed, “Control yourself. Don’t show such an expression in public.”</p><p>“It’s your fault!” she pouted. “What am I supposed to do when you praise me with a smile like that?”</p><p>“Shall I refrain from praising you, then?”</p><p>“No! If you praise me more, I’m likely to get used to it, so I won’t react like this. Praise me more!”</p><p>Her shameless smile was gone, so he dropped his sleeve and sighed. “Good grief, you’re a handful.”</p><p>She puffed her cheeks out at him before she spun on her heel and went looking for admiration elsewhere.</p><p> </p><p>That night, Ferdinand pretended to lock himself away to indulge in research before activating his amulet of Verbergen and taking to the skies in his highbeast. The magic circle created by activating the shrines to the Supreme Couple and Exalted Five glowed gently below him. No matter how much it angered the tree, this really was the most efficient way to enter the Garden of Beginnings.</p><p>As he’d done in his youth, he blasted his mana into the circle until he forced his way into where Erwaermen waited, looking displeased.</p><p>“Quinta,” the former god chastised him, “that is not the proper way to enter the garden.”</p><p>“I’m here to complete my wisdom,” Ferdinand said, ignoring him.</p><p>“I see. Do you plan to have Myne receive hers this time as well?”</p><p>Ferdinand sighed. “She will have to get the tablets in order to increase the quality of her schtappe, but can you gods even tell her apart from me? Was that not what led you to order us to kill each other before?”</p><p>“She is the vessel Mestionora inhabited twice. We know her.”</p><p>The way he spoke of Rozemyne as though she were a flower vase rather than a person that his own selfish, shortsighted actions had already deprived Ferdinand of vexed him, but he kept his rage tamped down. “I do not have all night,” he said. “I must be back before the Goddess of Light graces the sky.”</p><p>“Dregarnuhr will assist. Prepare yourself to accept it in full this time.”</p><p>The pain was immense but nothing compared to the sound of a light yellow feystone clattering against a white stone floor. Eventually, it ended, leaving him nearly trembling as he wiped sweat away from his brow.</p><p>“Quinta,” Erwaermen said, “the weave is quite different from last time. You were told to keep it as intact as possible.”</p><p>“And so I am,” Ferdinand said. “As much as possible while ensuring I can produce more zent candidates for you. I cannot help what following your orders does to the weave. Now, send me back.”</p><p>Erwaermen’s brows furrowed. “It is true that there are more possible candidates this weave, if only a few.”</p><p>A few more? So then had Wilfried and Charlotte gotten their schtappes from the base of the tree as well? An image of his nephew ruling Yurgenschmidt flitted through his mind, sending a shiver down his spine. It would take all of half a bell for someone to trick him into committing some massive blunder by taking advantage of his straightforward nature.</p><p>“However,” the former god continued, “it is disconcerting that Myne obtained one tablet but has not returned for the rest when she gathered them all at the same time before. Is this your doing?”</p><p>Ferdinand narrowed his eyes at him. “Now that I’ve completed my Wisdom, is Rozemyne even able to obtain hers? We shared the same one.”</p><p>“Mestionora has no issue distinguishing between you and the one she incarnated twice. She will guide the gods and ensure she receives her own names from the Supreme Couple.”</p><p>Well, that was one mystery solved. Everyone had their own names, and he and Rozemyne were perhaps the only two people in history who knew the same ones, save for any fools who shared theirs at their peril. The knowledge that this would no longer be the case left him feeling oddly bereft, though he couldn’t understand why. It was not a connection he knew they shared before. Why should it matter if it was severed?</p><p>“Yes,” Ferdinand eventually answered him, “it is my doing. I told her to wait to obtain the other tablets until she received her divine protections since they are the only way to grow her schtappe. Why are you so concerned with her when you said you would not force her to become your Zent? Is there not another candidate gathering tablets?”</p><p>Erwaermen nodded. “There is, though she has only gathered two.”</p><p>Ferdinand raised his brows. With how much time she’d spent flying over the grounds, he felt certain Eglantine would have visited more than two shrines. However, they were exceedingly difficult to find in winter. Perhaps now that she was a professor, she would look during the spring or summer. If a third archnoble joined the library, too, then the shumils would lead her to the forbidden archive and let her obtain Grutrisshiet. What would the woman so blinded by the desire for peace that she’d even let that fool Sigiswald ascend the throne do once she had her hands on the book? If she took the throne for herself, he could guarantee she wouldn’t allow them to acquire Ahrensbach. She would determine that it could inspire bad actors to attempt to take the foundations of other duchies, causing the nation to fall into a series of wars over the seat of aub.</p><p>Well, if Eglantine seemed poised to become the next Zent, he would simply take the country foundation for himself then install a temporary zent at his leisure once he created another Grutrisshiet and convinced them to swear their name.</p><p>“Then you are in a more favorable position than you were in the last weave, are you not?” Ferdinand said. “Now, stop wasting my time and send me back.”</p><p>The gods obeyed.</p><p>He found himself standing in the Goddess of Time’s gazebo, the God of Darkness’s cloak still covering the sky. He judged he had a fair amount of time before first bell, so he flew to Ehrenfest’s gathering spot and started harvesting ingredients. They had only sent him a small sample of what was available, after all, and he didn’t expect he’d have many more opportunities to obtain such rare specimens until he became consort. His impromptu trip led to a new discovery - feybeasts did not seem to notice him when the amulet was activated. It made gathering feystones child’s play.</p><p> </p><p>Ferdinand was dead on his feet the next morning, but he would still attend the events of the day with Rozemyne. He would never let sleep deprivation keep him from performing his duties as escort. Before they left to watch the sword dance and dedication whirl, Rozemyne asked Sylvester, “Can I sit with Father and Mother today so we can watch Cornelius as a family?”</p><p>Sylvester held his chin as he pondered the question for a moment. “Tell you what. Ask me again when we get there where other people can hear.”</p><p>She tilted her head in confusion for a moment before realization dawned on her, and she nodded.</p><p>And with that, no one would be able to accuse Aub Ehrenfest of treating his adopted daughter differently from his blood children. Justus hadn’t noticed many negative rumors in this regard, but some did occasionally come up. Some had said it was cruel for him to engage her to his Ewigeliebe little brother at such a young age, that is until word of how she’d spoken of her future dark god to the prince at the fellowship gathering or at tea parties had made its rounds. They spoke ill of his assigning her to be High Bishop until Wilfried and later Charlotte spoke openly about being a priest and shrine maiden themselves. The positive relationship between the three siblings also went a long way in quelling rumors. Even so, Sylvester was still on guard as he knew better than nearly anyone how important perception was.</p><p>When they arrived at their destination, Rozemyne had done as requested, and so Ferdinand sat with her and the Linkbergs, Elvira watching on with an intensity that made him want to shift away from her gaze. Before the sword dance began, Ferdinand offered her a sound-blocking tool, telling her to hold it throughout the performance.</p><p>She gave him a fake smile and asked, “Oh? But why? Do you believe me incapable of controlling myself?”</p><p>“No,” he said, “but I thought you would enjoy sharing your true feelings as you watched.”</p><p>Her smile became genuine as she took the tool from him. Elvira wore a similar grin as she made notes in her diptych. Good gods, how many volumes would she write about the two of them once she put her exaggerated version of their story to paper?</p><p>As Cornelius danced, Rozemyne watched on with excitement, commenting on everything from how his style differed from Angelica’s to the way his clothes flowed with his movements. Ferdinand listened to her ramblings with a small smile on his face, pleased beyond words that he could allow her to experience this much joy without worrying if she would pass out or fire off blessings thanks to her improved health and strict training from Elvira. Once again, he wondered how he could convince her to give him the gold powder she was making in the leather bag at her belt.</p><p>When the dedication whirl began, Rozemyne’s eyes widened, and she grabbed his hand, much to Elvira’s delight. She turned her shocked expression to him and whispered, “Ferdinand, that magic circle… It wasn’t there last year.”</p><p>“It was,” he said. “You just couldn’t see it.”</p><p>“The statue?” she asked.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>“I see,” she said, releasing him and sitting back in her chair, her mood somewhat dampened. He couldn’t fathom what she found so disappointing. Had she perhaps expected him to be excited about the circle? If so, he would only let her down more next time she read the High Bishop’s bible and found the same circle and got a similar disinterested response. Conventional wisdom might suggest he attempt to fake enthusiasm for her sake, but she would see through any such falsehood and only grow more upset. Sometimes, there truly was no winning with her.</p><p>After the performances, they returned to the dormitories to eat lunch, Cornelius speeding through his so he could get ready for graduation, though not before getting an extra boost of confidence from his little sister’s effuse praise. They then attended the graduation ceremony, which concluded without incident. That night, however, Ferdinand found himself unable to sleep and unwilling to use the charm Rozemyne had made for him and leave himself vulnerable.</p><p>The next day, Ferdinand spent the morning in agony as he waited for Rozemyne to ask him to go with her to the library. He doubted Raublut would even be there this weave, given he’d originally come to investigate the rumor of the forbidden archive Rozemyne had shared with Prince Hildebrand, but with all the other changes, he couldn’t discount the possibility he’d meet them there regardless. He didn’t want to risk being brought to the knight commander’s attention, but he also didn’t want Rozemyne to face him alone. She had displayed her vast quantity of mana two days before with both her shield and her healing, though Wilfried had taken some of that attention as well. Even so, Ferdinand couldn’t predict how the Sovereignty would move given all the new factors in play.</p><p>In the end, when she asked him to escort her, he suggested she take Sylvester instead since she’d yet to show him the fruits of her labor as a library committee member, and he was certain his older brother would enjoy seeing her with the shumils. He made sure Sylvester could overhear the suggestion, and nothing could stop him from charging towards something that promised to be interesting. Wilfried and Charlotte wanted to tag along as well, which meant Florencia would join them. Ferdinand elected to stay behind and handed over the filled feystones and magic contract that would keep Schwartz, Weiss, and a few other magic tools operational during the off season. He cautioned Rozemyne that this would likely be her last chance to act as the shumils’ master as it appeared they would be getting a third archlibrarian soon, meaning they would have enough suppliers to accommodate ownership of them, especially if she and Hannelore continued to supply mana to other tools in the library as committee members.</p><p>Rozemyne was obviously disappointed that he wouldn’t be joining them, but she said, “I apologize for asking you to join me when you’re in such desperate need of rest. Please, go try to get at least a little sleep before we have to return to Ehrenfest.” Her concern filled him with guilt, so after he saw them off, he returned to his room and pushed an infinitesimal amount of mana into the magic circle on the handkerchief Rozemyne had made him and took a brief nap.</p><p>When he awoke, he went downstairs to find Sylvester emerging from one of the meeting rooms, his face flushed with spent mirth. They’d evidently only recently returned from the library, and his older brother had needed to lock himself away while he gave in to his boisterous laughter. When they made eye contact, Sylvester snorted but contained himself and said, “Man, the sight of those shumils bouncing around her calling her ‘Milady’ was hilarious! It made me wonder if it wasn’t the blessing that made her their master but that they thought she was one of them.”</p><p>“Hey!” she said, puffing out her cheeks. “Don’t be so rude! I’m much taller than they are!”</p><p>“Whatever,” Sylvester said, poking her cheek until she chirped like a shumil, which nearly sent Lieseleta into a fit.</p><p>Florencia moved to tighten her husband’s leash as Elvira pulled Rozemyne to her side and started giving her gentle reminders about letting fools bait her.</p><p>Sighing heavily, Ferdinand walked over to Sylvester and asked after the feystones. He confirmed they were safely delivered, which prompted Ferdinand to ask, “Were there any issues that occurred while you were there?”</p><p>The aub shook his head. “Nope. None. We were the only ones there. Oh, but apparently whatever death threat you sent to the students last time was so effective that neither of the two new librarians had to even send reminders to return their materials. You really are the merciless Lord of Evil. Did you even hesitate when dealing out all that trauma to kids in the height of their summer?”</p><p>Ferdinand shrugged. “I merely prioritized efficiency. It is they who are to blame for any ‘trauma’ they received as they were the ones standing in violation of the agreement they made when registering to use the library.”</p><p>Shaking his head, Sylvester muttered, “Good gods, and that made Bluanfah dance for her…? Maybe you two are perfect for each other.”</p><p>Ferdinand turned away from him with a disgusted scoff. He was too sleep-deprived to deal with his nonsense.</p><p> </p><p>When they returned to the duchy, Rozemyne needed no prompting to include her siblings in the information selling process as their retainers had taken part as well. She still organized everyone and had her own scholars do more work than others, but it at least had the appearance of equality. Granted, the bulk of the extra work was related to stories that had been collected from other duchies. As soon as it was all sorted and everyone was paid, Rozemyne gave her mana compression method lecture, though this time several former Veronica faction children were in attendance. They had agreed to sign the stricter contracts in order to keep from falling behind anymore than they already had. There were still some holding out, either due to financial burden or unwillingness to sign the contract, but Ferdinand imagined it wouldn’t be long until they, too, would pay to be bound to the archduke.</p><p>It wasn’t long after that Rozemyne had Sylvester’s castle chefs train hers to cook Ahrensbach-style fish, but Ferdinand refrained from taking part in the meal this time, unwilling to relive the unpleasant memories the meal had evoked. She let it go without much complaint when he explained that he had much work to do with Hartmut to complete the handoff of High Priest duties to him before summer.</p><p>After they completed the book sale, Rozemyne returned to the temple for a short time to prepare for Melchior’s baptism. She was already familiar with the prayers and procedures, so her efforts were mostly focused on ensuring her robes, bible, and various accouterments were ready. This left him plenty of room to provide her with a new book to read, and she gleefully took it into her hidden room. It was only natural, of course, that her attendants became worried when she didn’t come out for lunch or supper, completely ignoring the call light they had desperately been flashing.</p><p>With a heavy sigh, he followed Fran into the High Bishop’s chambers and barged into her hidden room, Eckhart close behind for appearances sake. Her eyes were glued to the page, and as he expected, she didn’t notice him when he approached or called out her name. With yet another sigh, he motioned for Eckhart to close the door and then yanked the book from Rozemyne’s hands.</p><p>“Hey!” she protested. Her attempts to retrieve her reading material ceased when she saw who had so rudely interrupted her. “Ferdinand? What are you doing here? Brother Eckhart?”</p><p>He gave her a fake smile as he set the book down and crossed his arms. “It seems you failed to eat lunch or supper, so your attendants came to retrieve me out of concern for you.”</p><p>“Really?” she asked. “That much time has passed? Wait, you didn’t say anything when I didn’t show up for either of our meals?” A heartbeat later, her eyes widened. “Oh! You were researching, weren’t you? Was that why you gave me the book? I thought it was uncharacteristic of you to let me have so much reading time in the temple.”</p><p>Ferdinand’s smile turned into a genuine smirk. “That’s not why,” he said. “I simply knew you would not be able to control yourself and that your attendants would ask me to retrieve you from your hidden room before long.”</p><p>Rozemyne’s face flushed red as she gasped. “So you set this up so you could be alone with me in my hidden room?”</p><p>Taking a seat across from her, he chuckled and said, “We’re not alone. Is your brother not standing right there?”</p><p>She glanced at him and then once again pursed her lips in disappointment.</p><p>“Rozemyne,” he said, holding out his arms, “come here.”</p><p>Geduldh’s noble color returned to her cheeks, and she bounded over without hesitation. Eckhart turned away as Ferdinand gathered her into a hug and said to her, “Good job on coming first in class once again, Rozemyne. Ehrenfest could not ask for a better archduke candidate. You are my pride and joy.”</p><p>She began trembling, and by the time he noticed her ring glowing, it was already too late. A giant green blessing shot from her and rained down on the two of them. “Sorry!” she squeaked.</p><p>“Don’t apologize,” he sighed. “It’s not as if anyone else saw you give Bluanfah’s blessing.”</p><p>As she buried her face in his neck to hide her embarrassment, he idly wondered if she would end up blessing her own starbinding ceremony. Then, a more troubling thought came to mind. He tried to banish it, but he couldn’t shake the image of white lights raining down from the canopy of a shared bed.</p><p>Somewhere, he thought he heard Beischmacht laughing.</p><p> </p><p>The spring feast and Melchior’s baptism concluded much as they had in the previous weave, though this time there were seventeen honor students, not thirteen, so their commemorative feystones were even smaller than before, though they were still a respectable size. Afterwards, Ferdinand brought Rozemyne and her guard knights to his workshop in his estate where he showed them how to dissect the remaining fish from Ahrensbach. His heart almost stopped when she ripped off the first regisch scale and said, “Aren’t these the same feystones you used to make my hairpin?”</p><p>She had no idea how correct those words were. “Yes,” he said, “they’re a valuable ingredient. Rainbow-colored feystones are rare, and those are filled with your mana.”</p><p>“I see,” she said, looking disappointed. Why was he only disappointing her lately? “I thought you’d be able to get something new from this, but it looks like you were one step ahead of me again.”</p><p>“No, I will always appreciate obtaining more precious ingredients like these. I am quite satisfied.”</p><p>She only looked slightly ameliorated. He didn’t know what else he could say to improve her mood, but he knew what he could do. Once they finished descaling their fish, he cautioned everyone to stand back before he fileted the regisch. Just like last time, Rozemyne let out a delighted gasp as she clasped her hands before her, the very image of a girl deep in spring. He didn’t want to allow Angelica to join him this time, but he had no reasonable excuse to refuse her assistance. As they made short work of the remaining fish, he was gratified to see that his fiancé’s eyes stayed glued to him, rarely ever drifting to her guard knight.</p><p>The meal was as splendid as he recalled, the techniques Rozemyne employed removing the terrible associations he had with Ahrensbach ingredients. When the salt-grilled fish came out, he couldn’t resist teasing her. “That’s the fish you have been going on about?” he asked. “It smells appetizing.”</p><p>Her smile broadened as her hardening gaze said, <em>You wouldn’t dare steal your lovely fiancée’s food that she’s been looking forward to all this time, would you?</em></p><p>His responding look said, <em>I absolutely would.</em></p><p><em>You’re a terrible person,</em> she seemed to say. <em>How do I get out of this?</em></p><p><em>Oh, there’s no getting out of this,</em> he tried to tell her. <em>Give me the fish.</em></p><p>
<em>Go catch your own fish!</em>
</p><p>
<em>Who was it that prepared all these ingredients for you, hm?</em>
</p><p>Her smile turned saccharine as she said, “I’m so glad it appeals to you. As High Bishop, I shall bestow upon you, the High Priest, my leftovers. Are divine gifts not wonderful? Praise be to the gods for the customs they have us follow in their house that all may be fed.”</p><p>He raised a brow, amused to hear the words he’d teased her with in the last weave thrown back at him.</p><p>“Gods, could they stop flirting already?”</p><p>“Hear, hear.”</p><p>Cornelius and Damuel received stern glares for their mumblings and add their names to the list of people he would torture, <em>ahem</em>, train to within an inch of their lives. They obviously read something of his intentions in his face for they blanched in response.</p><p>When Rozemyne finished her “half” of the salt-grilled fish, she offered him the rest. “I shall graciously accept your gift,” he said, eating what remained with a contented smile.</p><p> </p><p>Spring Prayer was nearly upon them, so Rozemyne held a meeting with the Plantin, Gilberta, and Othmar companies beforehand. She and Ferdinand explained that printing was debuting much sooner than originally planned with demand for picture books and karuta in particular expected to increase drastically. Rozemyne also told them about Princess Eglantine and Lady Adolphine wearing hairpins during the interduchy tournament, so they could expect to see increased sales there as well.</p><p>The discussion then turned towards Groschel’s entwickeln. The merchants had provided blueprints for the shops and inns that would be installed in the lower city, and work was steadily progressing in the various workshops in both Ehrenfest and Groschel to complete what was needed to finish preparing for new visiting merchants in the summer, such as doors, windows, and furniture.</p><p>Towards the end of the meeting, Benno brought up Rozemyne’s mattress and displayed for her a chair made with the spring technology she was introducing to their world. She sat in it and gave her approval, stating she was looking forward to the mattress. She then let Ferdinand sit in it, and he pretended to be testing it for the first time. He of course wanted the improved mattress, but thoughts of the bench warmed and broke his heart in equal measure. He’d given it to Rozemyne before he left for Ahrensbach, certain it would have been destroyed if they sent it over once it was ready. Seeing it in the Ehrenfest tea party room when he’d stayed there the night before Detlinde’s graduation had filled him with such joy that he could scarcely contain his smile. After his harrowing days spent in enemy territory, he couldn’t express in words how it felt to have someone care for him again. Then, after she’d sold herself to royalty for his sake and had them force Detlinde to provide him a hidden room, she’d sent it to him so that he’d have somewhere safe and comfortable to sleep. As he’d watched Justus and Eckhart situate it to his liking, he’d begun to realize that there was someone more important to him than Ehrenfest, though he wouldn’t truly realize it until she’d taken Ahrenbach’s foundation.</p><p>Nodding to himself, he stood and said, “I would like a mattress and a bench made in this fashion. Janrik, prepare the order form.”</p><p>Benno quickly handed over a copy of the standardized forms they were using as Rozemyne accused, “You’re not planning to use that bench to sleep in your workshop, are you?”</p><p>He scoffed. “Am I not allowed a comfortable seat in my own workshop? Did you not receive one yourself just now?”</p><p>She shot him a bright smile that promised she would pester him about this later. Once their business was concluded, the merchants took his order form and left. As he was heading back to his office, he asked Janrik, “You included the hairpin order?”</p><p>“Of course, Lord Ferdinand.”</p><p>“And she didn’t notice?”</p><p>Janrik chuckled. “No, my lord. She was too distracted by your argument over the bench.”</p><p>“Excellent.”</p><p> </p><p>Ferdinand spent the days leading up to Spring Prayer teaching Wilfried, Rozemyne, and Charlotte content from the archduke candidate course while Melchior read or practiced math in the corner. Charlotte was able to participate to a greater degree than last weave, though she still struggled due to her lower mana capacity. With the compression method, however, Ferdinand saw no reason why she shouldn’t have more than enough mana to speed through the archduke course when it came time.</p><p>Once again, Rozemyne used that unsightly method of separating her mana into its base elements where she swung her arm around several times, though he didn’t bother to chastise her. She’d already apologized for her display and explained it was necessary for her to visualize the process, so she understood how she looked. There was no point in arguing with someone who already agreed with him.</p><p>Before they knew it, Spring Prayer was upon them, and they separated the districts as they normally did, though Hartmut would be traveling with Rozemyne to observe the process as he would be performing the ritual next year. They each took turns, passing the chalice between them, until at last the ritual was complete.</p><p>There was no time to rest, however, as they immediately prepared the entwickeln. Before they started, Sylvester sent the archnobles from each of their retinues to support the ones already in Groschel to power the city-wide waschen after the transformation was complete. Just like last time, Ferdinand provided rejuvenation potions, though they didn’t include blenrus since his tree was not yet able to produce fruit, though he was hopeful that a fortnight of Rozemyne’s blessing would change that.</p><p>They each went through six rounds of mana donation and potion drinking before they could complete the spell, and once they did, Sylvester sent off an ordonnanz to alert his head scholar that it was time for the waschen. Not long after, they received confirmation the cleaning was successful, and the archduke and his three children all cheered. Over the coming weeks, craftspeople and merchants would flood Groschel’s lower city to ready it to receive guests that summer. They didn’t have long, but if Rozemyne was confident they could accomplish the goal set for them, then Ferdinand was as well.</p><p>When it came time for the Archduke Conference, Ferdinand was on edge, dread constantly dripping down his throat and settling in his stomach as he waited for the dreaded summons. Each day that passed only brought him more anxiety to the point it was affecting his ability to properly teach the children what they needed to know for their classes or focus on the work he was required to do in Sylvester’s stead. If it weren’t for the children’s retainers that he’d so carefully trained, he doubted anything would have gotten done.</p><p>He assured himself over and over that they wouldn’t break his engagement to Rozemyne to force him to marry Detlinde. Dunkelfelger was supportive of their relationship - perhaps a bit too supportive, all the archducal children were part of the temple, and Ferdinand himself was due to leave in a few short weeks. Georgine didn’t have to lift a finger to have him moved out of her way. He’d also managed to avoid Raublut while ensuring he didn’t create any of the associations they’d made between him and the Grutrissheit, though he couldn’t help almost laughing at the irony that he actually was a threat this time around.</p><p>As time dragged on, flashes of his life after the Archduke Conference kept interfering with his life. Some were moments he treasured, like Rozemyne telling him he was her family or his holding her close as he whispered in her ear atop his highbeast. Most, however, made him want to scream in agony and punch something as hard as he could - Detlinde gloating after she tricked Letizia into poisoning him, holding Rozemyne as she cried after she’d been told he was leaving her, turning away from his family after receiving the most beautiful blessing he’d ever seen and facing his dim future, Detlinde demanding his name and telling him more than once that he should grovel at her feet, Rozemyne leaping to her feet in a panic as Sylvester revealed Georgine’s feystone and everyone keeping him from giving her the help she needed…</p><p>He apparently wasn’t hiding it as well as he thought, for when Rozemyne demanded they go into his hidden room, no one protested. He pulled a chair over and sat across from her, his arms folded. “What is this about?” he asked.</p><p>“That’s what I want to know!” she said. “You’ve been so upset these past few days that I’m wondering if I’m about to have to help you start hiding bodies.”</p><p>“Ridiculous,” he scoffed. “The bodies would turn into feystones, and I would need no help in hiding those.”</p><p>“Stop deflecting!” she cried. “Tell me what’s bothering you!”</p><p>What was he supposed to say? That the gods had let him travel back in time to save her so long as he saved their precious garden as well, and that this was the point in the weave when his suffering began? Of course he couldn’t, nor could he lie, for she’d see right through him. Whatever he said would have to be the truth. “I’m worried,” he admitted. “You were already a person of interest to two members of the royal family, and then you demonstrated your vast mana capacity as a mere second year student by protecting and healing so many people at the interduchy tournament that I’m afraid the king will pass down some sort of order that will tear us apart.”</p><p>She stood up and walked over to him, taking his hands in hers. “You don’t have to worry about that. I won’t let that happen.”</p><p>“Rozemyne,” he scoffed, “you cannot defy a royal order.”</p><p>“Maybe not,” she said, “but if I’m the one giving them, it doesn’t matter, doesn’t it?”</p><p>His eyes widened as his eyes snapped up to hers. “You can’t mean that.”</p><p>Her face was blessed by Schneeahst as she stared at him and said in a deadly calm voice, “Oh, I absolutely do.”</p><p>The shiver that ran through him was not entirely from her cold gaze.</p><p>“Now,” she said, squeezing his hands, “tell me what’s really bothering you.”</p><p>“I did.”</p><p>“No, you didn’t.”</p><p>“That was it.”</p><p>“No, it wasn’t.”</p><p>“It would take too long to explain.”</p><p>“We have all the time in the world. No one can bother us here.”</p><p>Once again, he wondered if some things were just meant to be. With a resigned sigh, he began telling her for the second time in his life about Adalgisa. When he explained the purpose of the villa and how the princesses of Lanzenave were used to produce high-manaed offspring, she sat in his lap, holding one of his hands in both of hers as she leaned her head against his shoulder. When he spoke of how he himself was born to be a feystone, she hugged him, and by the time he told her about his royal blood and his concern that the false king would see him as a threat, he’d wrapped his arms around her, drew her into himself, and buried his face in her shoulder. He let all of his fear spill out with his words, though he refrained from telling her what truly scared him - that he was about to live through the worst year of his life again.</p><p>It truly was comforting being held by someone who cared about him. He could understand why Rozemyne had always been so desperate for hugs. He had to restrain himself for now, but once he’d bound his stars to her, he wondered if he’d ever be able to let her go.</p><p>When Rozemyne sensed he’d calmed down, she said, “Ferdinand, I want you to know something.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“You were never meant to be a feystone. You were always meant to be happy. You deserve to be happy.”</p><p>His scoff turned into a light chuckle. Rozemyne would always be Rozemyne, no matter how patterned the weave. He lifted his head and gave her a genuine smile which she returned.</p><p>Once the moment passed, she stood up and held out a hand to him. “Now,” she said, “let’s go. Whatever we face, we’ll face it together, and if anyone tries to come between us, I’ll just beat them to death with the Glutrissheit.”</p><p>“Good gods, you would risk getting blood on a book?” he chuckled.</p><p>“It’s a divine instrument,” she said with a shrug. “They can clean themselves.”</p><p>He furrowed his brow at her. “How do you know it’s a divine instrument?”</p><p>“Isn’t it obvious?” she asked, tilting her head. “Every other object associated with a god is a divine instrument. Wouldn’t Mestionora’s book be as well? Besides, that tablet was absorbed into my schtappe, so that leads me to believe the Glutrissheit is also a schtappe transformation.”</p><p>He stared at her, dumbfounded. This girl who wasn’t introduced to the world of nobles until she was eight had figured out what the entire remaining royal family could not. The fools were still searching for a physical artifact, though in their defense, the royal family had been using a magic tool in place of the real Book of Mestionora for generations, so he supposed he shouldn’t chastise them too harshly.</p><p>He absolutely would, though.</p><p>When they left the hidden room, nearly all of the retainers looked relieved, save Cornelius who was glowering at him. Hopefully the boy would calm down after their starbind; he would not survive the training he would have to endure for trying to keep him away from his wife.</p><p>When Sylvester returned a few days later with a blank expression, Ferdinand’s stomach sank as his mind flew through the possibilities. It was nothing involving him, he was certain, or he would have been summoned to the conference. Wilfried, Rozemyne, and Charlotte had all protected people from other duchies and Wilfried and Rozemyne had healed several whom they hadn’t taken under their shields, so Ehrenfest shouldn’t have drawn suspicion for having no casualties. Ferdinand was engaged to Rozemyne, so any perceived “propping up” he did for her saintly reputation could be easily dismissed as merely trying to improve his own position in Ehrenfest. Besides, her actions after the attack had likely confirmed her status as a saint in the eyes of nearly everyone who had been there.</p><p>When they got to the conference room, Sylvester said, “A lot happened, so everyone pay attention, or you’ll miss something important. First, Ehrenfest is now ranked seventh.”</p><p>“Seventh?” Ferdinand breathed. They hadn’t ranked higher than eighth last time due to their lack of influence. Had conducting deals with Drewanchel and Eglantine crediting Rozemyne for her adoption changed that?</p><p>“Lady Adolphine of Drewanchel, who was originally supposed to marry one of the princes, has also been adopted by the second queen. Princess Eglantine wanted me to personally inform you, Rozemyne, that she has taken the oath to Mestionora and become the third archlibrarian.”</p><p>Rozemyne looked positively delighted. Sylvester only sighed with exhaustion.</p><p>“The son of the king’s third wife, Hildebrand, debuted during the conference. Since both the first and second prince were born from a queen from a middle duchy and the third queen is from Dunkelfelger, there’s a lot of speculation that he will be the one to ascend the throne. The first two, after all, were unable to secure marriages with the archduke candidates from Klassenberg or Drewanchel, despite it being set in stone up until their adoptions. Of course, no one expected Princess Eglantine to convince Aub Klassenberg to disown her so she could be adopted, nor did anyone expect her to have Aub Drewanchel demote his daughter to archnoble status for the same reason. Regardless, she has loudly proclaimed it was through the divine guidance of Mestionora.” He gave Rozemyne a hard glare who only put a hand on her cheek and tilted her head in response as if to say, <em>Oh? How is this my fault when I’m perfectly innocent? I’ve barely talked to Princess Eglantine, so her rampages are her own doing, not mine.</em> Ferdinand would agree if it hadn’t been Rozemyne’s suggestion she visit one of the shrines that started this fiasco.</p><p>“We also got dozens of marriage proposals for Charlotte,” he said. “I was able to flat out reject most of them as they were archnobles and thus unsuitable for her as future aub. There were some archduke candidates who would be moving to Ehrenfest in the mix, however, so I put them off by saying I was carefully considering the matter with Charlotte’s feelings in mind. I’ll give you the list later, and you can get to know the ones already at the Academy to see if any catch your eye.”</p><p>“Yes, Father,” Charlotte said, her face as hard as Rozemyne’s when she was conducting business deals.</p><p>He nodded to her and continued his announcement. “I also got several proposals for second and third wives. As we are now the Seventh, I…I can’t…” He groaned as he pressed a fist against his forehead while Florencia sighed and patted his arm. “I can’t put it off any longer. Florencia and I will carefully consider the candidates and conduct meetings with the ones we feel will bring the most benefit to Ehrenfest.”</p><p>Ferdinand could have sworn he heard Charlotte mutter something along the lines of, “About time,” but he wasn’t sure. He would have agreed with her except after falling in love with Rozemyne, the very idea of even looking at another woman sickened him beyond measure.</p><p>“We renewed trade deals with the Sovereignty and Klasseberg, though Klassenberg is getting fewer slots this year since one of their merchants left behind his daughter presumably to spy on our printing industry. We made new deals with Dunkelfelger and Drewanchel, both of whom were more than happy to take up the slots Klassenberg lost. We also finalized the deal for printing the modern translation of Dunkelfelger’s history as well as deals to spread the printing industry to both Dunkelfelger and Drewanchel. They will abide by the patent, copyright, royalty, and legal deposit systems, meaning everyone else will as well. The Sovereignty and Klassenberg are already slated to be added to the expansion next year, so Rozemyne, prepare your Gutenbergs. You, me, Elvira, and Charlotte will meet later to discuss details.</p><p>“Picture books and karuta were popular topics of conversation as were Rozemyne’s recipes. We were able to tease her recipe book to garner more interest in the printing industry as well. Needless to say, however, our edge on grades will be all but gone once the picture books and karuta start leaving the duchy. There’s nothing we can do about that except try to profit as much as we can and hold the advantage for as long as possible. Regardless, we still have the study guides the kids put together as well as Rozemyne’s compression method, so it’s not like those two things were all we had going for us.</p><p>“And finally…” Sylvester sighed and hung his head as Florencia cast her gaze down. The retainers who had gone to the conference with them tensed. “Wilfried, I’m… I’m so sorry. I swear, I fought my hardest against this.”</p><p>The boy’s face blanched. “What? What happened?”</p><p>“The king ordered us to dissolve your engagement with Brunhilde and have you marry Lady Detlinde of Ahrensbach to support her once she becomes aub.”</p>

<p>“The king ordered us to dissolve your engagement with Brunhilde and have you marry Lady Detlinde of Ahrensbach to support her once she becomes aub.”</p><p>My heart dropped. “Brunhilde…!” I called, spinning around in my seat to search for my fiancée - <em>former</em> fiancée - among Rozemyne’s retainers. Her eyes were wide with shock, and she was covering her mouth. I reached out for her on instinct but then caught myself, letting my hands hang awkwardly in the air. Her eyes got glassy then, and it really hurt that there wasn’t anything I could do about it.</p><p>“Alright, everyone except Wilfried and Ferdinand, clear the room.”</p><p>Rozemyne and Charlotte both gave my hands a supportive squeeze before they left. Brunhilde, however, just spun on her heel and walked out the door. I knew that was the proper response for an attendant, but it didn’t make it hurt any less.</p><p>Uncle crossed his arms and glared at Father with a deep frown on his face. “So?” he asked. “What asinine excuse did they use to justify this when there are more than enough male archduke candidates in higher-ranked duchies perfectly willing to move to lower-ranked ones, as evidenced by Charlotte’s proposals?”</p><p>Father gave a sardonic laugh. “What excuse <em>didn’t</em> they use? They said I was mistreating him by telling him he’s going to be knight commander when I’m putting you in that role any day now. They said I’ve been lying to him to keep him under control since I took him out of the running for aub even though he’s a far stronger candidate than Charlotte.”</p><p>“What?” I asked. “But none of that’s true!”</p><p>“The truth doesn’t matter in this case, only what is believed,” Uncle sighed. “What, pray tell, makes him a stronger candidate than your daughter?”</p><p>“The fact he can <em>apparently</em> summon all the divine instruments - and don’t think I’ll forget about this one, Wilfried,” Father said, pointing a finger at me. “You’re going to show them all to me, you hear? I wanna see it with my own eyes. Anyway, that and the shield he made at the interduchy tournament was bigger, he healed more people, he restored the gathering spot with Rozemyne, and he’s been an honor student two years running. He even beat out the Drewanchel archduke candidate this year. Oh, and he’s the one that told Rudiger about participating in religious ceremonies to get better harvests.”</p><p>Uncle furrowed his brows. “I see. Surely that wasn’t enough, though.”</p><p>“No,” Father said, shaking his head. “They also said that the engagement with Brunhilde was really a plan to demote a qualified candidate to archnoble just because Detlinde had shown interest in him, and we wanted to spite Ahrensbach. They used Bettina’s imprisonment as proof of our resentment.”</p><p>“They weren’t foolish enough to bring up the purge, then,” Uncle said. “Still, that’s too weak. Surely there’s more.”</p><p>Father slumped back in his chair and ran a hand through his hair. “Contradictory to everything else they said about him being the best candidate for aub, they brought up the White Tower incident and said he would make the perfect husband for Detlinde because with the stain on his reputation, they wouldn’t be able to remain in power when Letizia came of age. Or something along those lines. I don’t know. When I was alone with the king, though, he said that Wilfried’s impressive mana capacity was sorely needed in Ahrensbach and that with the both you and the Saint of Ehrenfest here, we would do just fine without him.”</p><p>I scoffed. “And Drewanchel would suffer from losing one of their dozens of candidates? I feel like this is personal.”</p><p>“It certainly is,” Uncle said. “I would venture that Georgine is using this to hurt you, Sylvester.”</p><p>“I know she is!” Father yelled. “But I can’t do a damned thing about it!” He held his head in his hands and started apologizing to me for being unable to protect me, and seeing that just made me feel even worse.</p><p>“Fear not, Wilfried,” Uncle said. “There is still quite a bit of time before you would be expected to go to Ahrensbach. Things could change between now and then. Stay strong.”</p><p>When I left the meeting, I didn’t feel like doing anything. As mad as it would make everyone, I decided to skip practice with the knights and go to my room. Uncle had said things could change. I was pretty powerless in this situation, so I did the only thing I could - I compressed my mana. Maybe if I had so much mana that she couldn’t sense me, they would cancel this engagement, too.</p><p>Brunhilde was off the next day. We were supposed to have lunch together and spend some time walking around the gardens in the afternoon, but that was out the window now. She had to go home and talk to her family about all of our plans falling through. I would’ve bet almost anything that her parents were thrilled with the news. It meant they’d basically gotten an entwickeln for free, and they didn’t have to put up with having me as a son-in-law anymore.</p><p>Even though they saw me as a problem, Brunhilde didn’t. Even though she was a Leisegang, she didn’t make me feel like “Veronica’s grandson” or “the boy who entered the White Tower.” She made me feel like <em>Wilfried</em>. We’d been so proud of each other for getting honor student, and she’d been really supportive when I was struggling to make Schutzaria’s Shield rectangular. I didn’t think Detlinde would be like that. With the way she talked about my little sister, I knew she would look down on me for being a priest and participating in religious ceremonies. I’d be nothing more than a body filling a role, a source of mana to drain dry, and a stain on her reputation.</p><p>“This sucks,” I said as I kicked at a stone on the ground. Hardly anyone else was out here in the gardens today. That was part of why Brunhilde and I had been coming out here when we got back from the Academy - no one really came out in early spring, but since we could both make feystone armor under our clothes, the chill didn’t bother us. We could talk honestly with each other about the things we liked and didn’t like, what we were studying, whatever trends she was obsessed with, the newest thing I learned in knight training, and what we wanted in the future. We were basically becoming pretty good friends, though it’d still been weird sometimes to think I was going to marry her.</p><p><em>Was.</em> Now, I was going to Ahrensbach where I wouldn’t have to worry about the cold in spring.</p><p>I wondered if this would have made Grandmother happy. She was always going on about how wonderful Ahrensbach was, and I remembered eating Ahrensbach food as a kid, though the stuff my little sister made tasted way better. Grandmother would’ve probably said yes to me marrying Detlinde immediately without putting up a fight and celebrated for weeks. I wondered what she found so wonderful about Ahrensbach. I didn’t think she’d ever actually been to the duchy. She did get Aunt Georgine to marry the aub there, though, so she obviously thought it was a great place despite having never seen it.</p><p>I wondered if my aunt was happy there and how she would treat me when I moved there. I knew she was really mean to my dad, so it made me worry she would be mean to me, too, since I looked just like him. Rozemyne also said I didn’t pick up on subtle insults too easily, so I might not even notice if she was saying bad things straight to my face. Detlinde didn’t seem smart enough to play that kind of game, which was its own problem. How was she going to run a duchy with a brain like that? If she mouthed off to the wrong person, would I be at fault for not controlling her? I could barely finish a sentence without her cutting me off. How in the hell was I supposed to control a woman like that?!</p><p>When I went back to my room, Leopold got an ordonnanz from Charlotte, asking me to attend a tea party in the afternoon the following day. “I think it would be a good idea, my lord,” he said. It was the first time he’d really spoken to me since I told him a very general summary of what Father had said in the private meeting. He and my other retainers had stepped back and allowed me to stew in silence. I really appreciated that he seemed to know when I needed time to myself like this. If he thought I needed to go to this tea party despite how I was feeling, then I would trust him. Maybe seeing my sister would improve my mood a bit.</p><p> </p><p>My mood immediately plummeted when I walked into the room. Next to Charlotte was sitting Rozemyne and next to her was none other than Brunhilde. I didn’t think I could handle seeing her right now.</p><p>“Brother,” Charlotte called, pulling my attention back to her. “Come, have a seat.”</p><p>I did as she commanded and let my attendants put whatever they wanted on my plate. Once my little sister taste tested it, I took a bite of the sweet, not really tasting it at all. I didn’t know where to look, so I just let my eyes wander the room while I waited for the discussion to start.</p><p>Charlotte sighed and said, “Brother, how is your pound cake?”</p><p>Ah, we were eating pound cake. “It’s good.”</p><p>I was silent again as the three girls started a disjointed conversation. They sometimes tried to pull me in, but I only gave noncommittal answers. Why did Leopold think this was a good idea again? I wanted to be anywhere else but here. How could I pretend everything was fine with Brunhilde sitting right there? She had a polite smile on her face, but I could tell her voice was tight, so she was feeling something similar to me, but maybe it wasn’t as strong. Was I more invested in the relationship? Maybe she’d just wanted to play nice with me since that would mean getting entwickeln and the printing industry to Groschel sooner.</p><p>All of a sudden, a sound-blocking barrier went up. I hadn’t even noticed Charlotte had refreshed the tea.</p><p>“Now, Dear Brother, I hope you’ll start paying attention,” she said. “I have an important question to ask you, and I need you to be completely honest with me. Do you understand?”</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>“Do you want to marry Lady Detlinde?”</p><p>“Hell no!”</p><p>The three girls reared back at my outburst, but I only crossed my arms and glared back. They’d wanted my “completely honest” answer. That’s what they got.</p><p>Rozemyne recovered first, clearing her throat. “Then do you want to marry Brunhilde?”</p><p>What was the point of that question? My feelings didn’t matter at all. My future had been decided by some guy without a Grutrissheit wearing a false crown who’d only ever seen me long enough to tell me good job on the good grades.</p><p>“I’ll ask again,” Rozemyne said. “Do you wan–”</p><p>“It doesn’t matter, does it?!” I snapped. “It doesn’t matter how I feel! You think the king cares if I want her? I could want her all day long and it wouldn’t matter one bit!”</p><p>“Wilfried.”</p><p>I flinched, but the tension in my shoulders eased at hearing Brunhilde say my name. I turned my baleful gaze on her, waiting for her to deal the finishing blow to what remained of whatever had broken in my chest.</p><p>Her eyes were glassy again. “Do you… Were you speaking facetiously, or do you actually want to marry me?”</p><p>I opened my mouth to speak, but no words came out. How was I supposed to answer that? I’d just turned twelve. I hadn’t developed mana sensing yet, even though my little sister apparently already did - and that was a whole different cause of concern. I knew I wanted to keep seeing Brunhilde and hanging out with her. I knew I liked talking with her and watching her face light up when she talked about a new trend she was going to help spread. I knew I really, really liked it when she smiled at me and praised me when I did a good job.</p><p>But did that mean I wanted to marry her? I didn’t really know what marriage was yet. I hadn’t grown up seeing my father and mother interact like Charlotte had, so I didn’t really have much to go on. I did know my Mother made my Father happy, that Aurelia made Lamprecht happy, and that Rozemyne and Uncle were both lost causes.</p><p>I would have liked to have been happy with Brunhilde, too.</p><p>“Yes, I want to marry you,” I said eventually because it was probably true. If marriage was basically just more of what we’d already been doing, then I wanted to marry her.</p><p>“And Brunhilde?” Charlotte asked.</p><p>Her face was nearly the color of her hair, but her eyes were terribly sad. She looked down at the table and whispered, “I wanted to marry you, too.”</p><p><em>Wanted.</em> Man, I didn’t think I could hurt worse than I already did. This really sucked.</p><p>“Well then, Brother,” Charlotte said, “let’s talk about what we’re going to do about this. First, I have a question for the two of you. Are you willing to do whatever it takes, even if it means changing your positions?”</p><p>I frowned at her. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“I mean, would you still want to marry each other if you were becoming aub instead of knight commander or if Brunhilde would be your second wife instead of your first?”</p><p>Even Rozemyne looked confused.<br/>
“I mean, yeah, I guess,” I said, “but there’s no way I’m going to be aub, and I can’t take a second wife as a consort.”</p><p>“I know,” Charlotte said with a smile. “Brunhilde? What’s your answer?”</p><p>She nodded. “Yes. I would have no problem being a second wife if it would change anything. That might’ve worked out even better since I would’ve also been Giebe Groschel.”</p><p>“Why are you even asking this?” I shot at Charlotte. “Don’t you think it hurts enough without you dangling what-if’s and could-have-been’s in front of my face?”</p><p>“Oh, Wilfried,” Brunhilde said, reaching a hand for me before she caught herself. Gods, could the pain get any worse?! I had to close my eyes and steel my resolve so I didn’t embarrass myself by crying in front of everyone.</p><p>“It’s the king’s order,” I said through clenched teeth. “There’s nothing we can do.”</p><p>“That’s where you’re wrong, Dear Brother,” Charlotte said, a triumphant smile on her face. “There is exactly one law that supersedes anything the king says when it comes to marriage, but to pull this off, all four of us are going to have to work together, and we’re going to have to have the resolve to follow through because if this gambit fails, Melchior is going to be the next aub.”</p>

<h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
<p>A week after the Archduke Conference, Sylvester and Ferdinand received summons from Prince Anastasius to bring Traugott for questioning. Ferdinand’s stomach clenched as they teleported to the Ehrenfest dormitory and met members of the Sovereign Knight’s Order who escorted them down to a room set aside for the interrogation. Anastasius was waiting there along with his retinue and several guard knights. Thankfully, Raublut was not among them, likely because he was guarding the king. However, the vice commander was there, and he carried a box with him that Ferdinand recognized by size alone. They were going to read Traugott’s memories.</p><p>That was convenient. They would see firsthand Ahrensbach’s treachery. Perhaps then they would cancel Wilfried’s engagement, but Ferdinand doubted that would happen. Dregarnuhr did not weave that smoothly.</p><p>Apparently, Sylvester was also considering his son’s position because as the knights were securing Traugott, he said, “Prince Anastasius, Ordoschnelli flew true under Ewigeliebe’s harsh judgment, and yet it seems Dregarnuhr is playing tricks with Liebeskhife. May I ask if Ordoschnelli’s journey was not as successful as previously thought?”</p><p>The prince grimaced for a moment before his haughty attitude returned. “Even those in the highest heights must ensure they have the complete blessings of Anhaltung and Grammaratur before they approach the one with the largest cape, especially when Ordoschnelli brings news of Chaocipher’s meddling.”</p><p>In other words, Anastasius’ position in the royal family was currently weak enough that he felt the king would not heed his words without irrefutable proof of Ahrensbach’s wrongdoing. He had thus elected not to approach his father with his findings yet, save for informing him about trug. The king, therefore, moved according to Georgine’s machinations. If Raublut had been sent to investigate Ahrensbach, then he probably vouched for them, giving Trauerqual yet one more reason to side with the allied Sixth over the neutral, recently-promoted Seventh. It was frustrating, but Ferdinand could understand the reasoning behind the prince’s actions, or lack thereof.</p><p>Ferdinand and Sylvester waited in silence for the interrogation to conclude as they sipped their tea. They didn’t want to risk saying anything that might be misunderstood and weaken their position. Neither did they want to use sound-blocking tools lest they draw suspicion.</p><p>Naturally, the Sovereign Knight’s Order was scrutinizing their every move. As such, Sylvester projected a sense of confident calm as if to say, “Look all you want. I have nothing to hide.” Ferdinand chose to rely on his typical blank expression.</p><p>Eventually, the prince stormed out of the interrogation room and announced, “You may execute him at your leisure. I will have a meeting with the Zent, but do not expect any changes before the next Archduke Conference, if there are any.”</p><p>He dismissed them almost absentmindedly, his attention fully absorbed by what he witnessed in Traugott’s memories. After they returned to Ehrenfest, Sylvester immediately gave the order, and Karstedt left with three guard knights and Traugott.</p><p>Once he returned with the feystone, Sylvester, Ferdinand, and Karstedt met in the aub’s office under a sound-blocking barrier.</p><p>“So,” Sylvester started, “what’s the likelihood that the Zent will cancel the engagement?”</p><p>Ferdinand tapped his temple. “It depends on how Georgine moves. She’s exceptional at swaying public opinion, maneuvering others, and having pawns take the blame. I’m sure she had a contingency plan in place should they trace anything from Werkestock or the terrorist attack back to her.”</p><p>“So there’s a good chance nothing will change?” he asked.</p><p>“Perhaps,” Ferdinand said. “It’s hard to say given the difference in our positions, but this may not be enough to dissolve the engagement considering the dire straits Ahrensbach seems to be in.” In fact, Ferdinand was certain it wasn’t. He could think of at least three different ways Georgine could dodge any accusations off the top of his head. It was all about plausible deniability, and that was her expertise.</p><p>Now that Ferdinand had his Wisdom, he could take the country’s foundation and the throne, but unfortunately for his nephew, he wasn’t willing to go that far for him. They would have to keep gathering evidence against Ahrensbach and hope it would be enough before Wilfried came of age.</p><p>Sylvester sighed and scratched the back of his head. “I hate to do this, but I think we should push your departure from the temple back to winter. With all this uncertainty and the royal family’s involvement, I think it would be better not to switch knight commanders in the middle of it, and I would feel a lot better knowing you’re with Rozemyne in the temple. I don’t know how good Hartmut would be in a fight.”</p><p>“Oh?” Ferdinand asked, raising a brow. “You expect there to be some sort of violence at the temple?”</p><p>“Not really. I don’t know. I just have a gut feeling that it would be better to wait until winter.”</p><p>Ferdinand agreed to push the date back, the cold trickle of dread icing down his back.</p><p> </p><p>Ferdinand continued teaching the children the archduke candidate course content. On certain days of the week, Wilfried trained with Bonifatius, Karstedt, Eckhart, Cornelius, or Damuel to prepare for the knight course. Charlotte spent those days working alongside her father to learn more about the duties expected of the archduke, though she also occasionally brought Wilfried in, saying he, too, needed to learn so he could support her as Ferdinand supported Sylvester. He had to applaud her for her foresight, though he wanted to admonish her for expecting Ferdinand’s level of competence from her brother.</p><p>On the days the other children were studying elsewhere, Ferdinand focused on teaching Rozemyne what she needed for all four years of the scholar course, recalling how Fraularm had tried to force Rozemyne’s failure in the previous weave. This also included learning how to make all of his rejuvenation potions. The only brewing he didn’t cover was creating engagement stones and synchronizing potions. She could learn those in class. It wasn’t as if making them was so difficult that she couldn’t complete them the first time she was shown the recipe.</p><p>It was after the Summer Baptism that Rozemyne finally chose to give him what she’d promised - a fortnight of blessings for the blenrus tree. She had already been giving him feystones for his other plants, but she would begin giving her mana directly after she finished with the blessings.</p><p>They started on one of the days that her siblings weren’t with them. She came to his estate as always for her scholar lessons, and they moved to enter his hidden room. As if on cue, Cornelius kicked up a fuss, so as Ferdinand placed his hand on the door’s feystone, he made some stealthy adjustments before saying, “If you’re able to enter and remain quiet while we discuss matters your station does not permit you to know of, then you may come.”</p><p>Ferdinand entered first and held the door for Rozemyne and her petulant guard knight. She passed through just fine, but Cornelius smacked into an invisible barrier.</p><p>“What the…?!” he gasped, running his hands over the surface.</p><p>“Ah, it looks like you’re unable to enter. Perhaps spend this time compressing your mana.” Then, he shut the door in his face and turned to the box containing his glowing feyplant.</p><p>“Now,” he said, “let’s get started.”</p><p>Rozemyne tilted her head at him and asked, “Wasn’t Damuel able to enter before? Why is Cornelius locked out now?”</p><p>“Because I just added a mana restriction,” he said. “We cannot risk information about this blenrus plant getting out. The chaos that would ensue and the rift that would form between us and Giebe Haldenzel are unfathomable.”</p><p>“Couldn’t we just bring in our name-sworn and order them to secrecy?”</p><p>“We could,” he said. “Now, offer your blessing.”</p><p>With a resigned sigh, Rozemyne walked over to the plant, held her arms up, and invoked the goddesses of spring. Green light blazed above them and then trickled down over the blenrus tree.</p><p>“There,” she said. “We’ll see how it looks tomorrow.”</p><p>“Hmm… Very well,” he said, leaning over to inspect the plant. “I would like to stay behind and study the sapling, but before you go…” He straightened and turned to her with open arms.</p><p>She leapt into them without hesitation, squeezing him before looking up at him questioningly. “This is new. You’ve never offered me a hug when I didn’t ask or wasn’t on the verge of a mana rampage.”</p><p>He sighed. “I thought you would be in need of some comfort after the news about your brother. I know how you feel about family.”</p><p>She buried her face in his chest. “You’re right. Just for a little bit, then. Corrnelius will kill you otherwise.”</p><p>Ferdinand scoffed. “He can try. That fool seems to forget that I’m soon to be his knight commander.”</p><p>With a sympathetic hiss, she said, “Rest in peace, Dear Brother.” Ferdiand wasn’t completely sure what she meant, but he knew he had no intention of letting that buzzing fly rest.</p><p>After a bit, Ferdinand pulled away, grabbed her by the shoulders, and bent down to look her in the eye. “Rozemyne, I say this because, again, I know how you are about family. Do. Not. Go. On. A. Rampage. Do you understand?”</p><p>She puffed out her cheeks and said, “I’m not leading any rampages! Even I know how much I can be involved in something like this. Do you have a plan to save Wilfried, though?”</p><p>Ferdinand shook his head. “We’re waiting to hear the king’s verdict on certain matters next spring, but I don’t think it’s likely for the engagement order to be overturned at this juncture. We still have a few years, however, so we’ll have plenty of time to collect evidence against Ahresnbach.”</p><p>She nodded slowly, and he could see the beginnings of plans forming behind her eyes.</p><p>“Rozemyne!” he said. “No! Rampages!”</p><p>“I know already! I already said I wasn’t going to be leading any!”</p><p>“Fine. So long as you understand.”</p><p>He then sent her from his room and went back to his blenrus tree, making a record of all his observations.</p><p>The next day, he brought Rozemyne along with Eckhart and Janrik into the hidden room, having removed the mana restriction. Seeing the two retainers walk in unobstructed made Cornelius gape in disbelief before he stared at his hands with discontent, likely concluding that even Janrik possessed more mana than him. Ferdinand smirked at him as he closed the door.</p><p>He then turned to face his two name sworn. “Eckhart, Janrik, I order you thus: do not speak of what you observe in this room.”</p><p>“Yes, my lord,” They both responded, though Janrik looked uncomfortable.</p><p>“Good. Now, let’s get started.”</p><p>As he moved the screen he used to block his blenrus tree from sight, Rozemyne asked, “Where’s Justus?”</p><p>“I sent him on an errand.”</p><p>“You didn’t want to deal with all his questions, did you?”</p><p>“Indeed I did not. Now, come observe what your blessing did.”</p><p>She responded to his beckoning and peered down at the sapling. “It’s about to be taller than the box. You’re going to need to transplant it soon.”</p><p>“Yes, I plan to do so tomorrow before you offer your blessing. Now, did it grow this much from your blessings before?”</p><p>She nodded. “More or less. It was always around a finger's breadth.”</p><p>“I see,” he said, noting down her response. “Very well. Offer your blessing.”</p><p>She did as commanded, and then Ferdinand ran through a few checks, mostly to see if the concentration of her mana in the plant differed in any way from the day before. It hadn’t.</p><p>“Fascinating. Well, let us continue your brewing lessons while you are here. You wanted to learn how to make some of the magic tools Eckhart told you about from our past ditter games, correct?”</p><p>“Yes!” she said. “And I want to read any documentation you have on them!”</p><p>He snorted. “So that was your goal? Fine. I shall gather them and send them to you when I have the time. Now, let’s begin with the binding trap.”</p><p>They worked through the afternoon, Rozemyne showing an impressive amount of interest in something not related to libraries or books. Perhaps all their recent brewing had opened her eyes to the wonders of experimentation.</p><p> </p><p>“Ferdinand, you won’t believe this,” Sylvester said during one of their drinking sessions in midsummer. “Georgine asked to bring Detlinde here again. Again! How many times do I have to tell that woman no? Maybe she just likes hearing me say we can’t accept such important visitors due to political instability following our purge.”</p><p>“Considering you’ve been smiling every time you say it, I doubt that’s the reason. Incidentally, how is Aub Ahrensbach’s health?”</p><p>Sylvester shrugged. “Seemed fine to me. I don’t think he’s going to climb a certain staircase any time soon if that’s what you’re asking.”</p><p>Ferdinand looked down into his vize. So she really had poisoned her husband. He wasn’t surprised, but he wondered when she would kill him this time. Even if he died within the next bell, they couldn’t send Wilfried any sooner than they’d agreed to since he was underaged. It seemed she was moving back her timeline and planning to take him as a hostage. She’d originally attacked during Rozemyne’s fourth year, so she’d only have to wait another three after that. That seemed to be the most likely scenario.</p><p>Ferdinand would be out of the temple completely by winter. The question was how Georgine planned to remove Rozemyne. Of course, if she waited until she had Wilfried in her grasp, then Rozemyne would already have left the temple, so it was more or less a problem that would solve itself with time.</p><p>In the meantime, though, he had a brother to comfort. “You said you’ve been spending more time with your son.”</p><p>Sylvester nodded. “Yeah, I still can’t believe he can make the divine instruments. Ewigeliebe’s sword looks so cool! He was really proud of his shield, too. Oh, and get this - pretty much all the boys are including crests in their schtappes because of him, so Charlotte spread matriarchal symbols among the girls at Rozemyne’s suggestion. Check it out!”</p><p>He produced his schtappe, showing off the roaring lion he’d added. Its tail wrapped around half way up the shaft while its prowling form seemed to be carved into the handle.</p><p>“Impressive.”</p><p>“Right? He keeps asking me to play gewinnen, too. He’s getting pretty darned good, let me tell you. He’s winning about a quarter of our games.”</p><p>“Hmm… Perhaps when he makes it to three quarters, he’ll be a worthy opponent.”</p><p>Sylvester laughed. “Yeah, who knows? Maybe it’ll be Wilfried who breaks your winning streak.”</p><p>“I sincerely doubt it,” Ferdinand scoffed.</p><p>As they talked about these trivial matters, Sylvester’s mood improved. Ferdinand left the office with the feeling of accomplishment that came from a job well done.</p><p> </p><p>Two weeks before the Autumn Baptism, Ferdinand was watching Rozemyne clean up after their brewing session when she slipped him a sound-blocking tool under the table. As she bent her head to look at the ingredients she was putting away, she said, “I want you to come to the Italian restaurant with me before the Harvest Festival.”</p><p>He also found some ingredients to look at, stooping his head so his hair covered his mouth from the sides. “And why did you feel the need to so covertly ask me?”</p><p>She glanced at her retainers and muttered, “I don’t want everyone else coming along.”</p><p>Ferdinand smirked, recalling how all her retainers had found a way to attend his going-away dinner last weave. “You will still have to bring retainers.”</p><p>“I plan to bring Damuel, Matthias, Laurenz, Gretia, and Rosina.”</p><p>“Your name sworn whom you can force to remain silent and your guard knight whom you’ve blackmailed on more than one occasion?” he chuckled. “Very well. I shall do the same.”</p><p>Rozemyne pumped her fist below the table in victory before she took the tool back from him and finished cleaning.</p><p>Ferdinand led her to where his botany experiments waited. As she poured her mana into them, he thought about how this trip to the restaurant differed from before. For one, they were not leaving the temple unattended by bringing all of their personnel with them. For another, Viscountess Dahldolf was no longer alive to infiltrate Rozemyne’s chambers to steal the bible and its key. He wondered if they’d ever get their hands on Ahrensbach’s key now that Georgine had no minions left to do her bidding.</p><p> </p><p>Ferdinand had never been to the restaurant in the lower city with so few people before. It truly was only him and Rozemyne sitting at the table, their retainers taking their turns eating in the other room. He thought it would feel a bit quiet, but he found he preferred the atmosphere of eating with Rozemyne alone like they did at the temple or when she was studying for the scholar course. Its familiarity was comforting.</p><p>The dishes they brought out were similar to that from the last weave. The exquisite double consommé made him want to offer his prayers to the gods. If he were as prone to giving blessings as Rozemyne, he was certain lights would have been raining down on them throughout the soup course.</p><p>The rest of the food was just as delicious as he remembered. Dessert this time, however, did not include the overly-sweet rafel pie, only the milder Mont Blancs made with tanieh cream. It was enjoyable, though he was a little disappointed not to see the pie. He wasn’t sure why that was given he’d been unable to eat more than a single bite.</p><p>When the vestiges of their meal were cleared, Rozemyne held out a small box to him. “Here.”</p><p>He raised a brow as he took it. “What’s this?”</p><p>“A congratulatory present.”</p><p>“You’ve already treated me to lunch. There is no need to provide gifts on top of that, especially as I am merely returning to my old post.”</p><p>She gave him a polite smile, her burning eyes saying, <em>Just shut up and open it already.</em></p><p>Far be it from him to disobey a direct order from his goddess. He opened the box, and his eyes widened. Inside was the pendant she’d given him in the past weave, inscribed with a powerful, beautiful magic circle - the one that had saved his life. However, there was one significant difference. This one had Rozemyne’s crest engraved in it. The regisch scale had been expertly turned into a courtship necklace.</p><p>“This is fine work, Rozemyne.”</p><p>She cast her eyes downward. “I had to get Hartmut’s help with the circle.”</p><p>“Well, of course. We haven’t covered anything this advanced yet.” He passed the box to Justus, who looked to Rozemyne for some reason. Only when she nodded did he put the box away and return to his position.</p><p>He discovered the reason behind the look when they returned to the temple. Rozemyne followed him to the High Priest’s chambers and demanded that he sit down. Then, she took the box from Justus and removed the necklace from within.</p><p>Ferdinand stiffened as he realized her intentions. As she walked behind him, he clenched his fists on his knees, feeling extremely uncomfortable. A shiver ran through him as she brushed his hair aside, and the need to defend himself nearly took over, but he just barely managed to hold back. Slowly, he started counting in his head, willing his heart rate to slow. At last, the necklace was fastened around his neck, and Rozemyne had stepped back, a proud smile on her lips.</p><p>“It suits you,” she said.</p><p>He looked down and ran his fingers over the rainbow feystone, feeling her familiar mana. It truly was exquisite work. He tucked it into his robes and stared down at where it was resting on his chest.</p><p>When he looked up, Rozemyne was giving him a strained smile. She walked over to him and held out a sound-blocking tool. He took it and raised a brow at her.</p><p>“Umm… Ferdinand, I have a question. I’ve been wondering about it for a while now, but given the nature of it, I’ve been too afraid to ask Mother about it.”</p><p>Gods, she wasn’t going to ask him about winter, was she? With much trepidation, he nodded for her to continue.</p><p>Rozemyne’s gaze flitted about the room before she leaned forward over his desk, covered her mouth with her hands, and asked, “Why does it feel comforting when your mana is on my skin?”</p><p>Ferdinand covered his face as he tried to force his brain to work again. He hadn’t expected her to notice yet. He’d need to address this before she gained enough confidence to ask Elvira. He could only imagine what the woman would do if she found out.</p><p>Without another word, he stood and opened the door to his hidden room. None of the retainers protested this time since it was only their name-sworn, Damuel, and their gray robes. Once she was inside, he closed the door and pulled his chair to its usual spot. “What I’m going to tell you doesn’t leave this room. Nothing about how our mana interacts is to be shared with anyone else. Understand?”</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>“You don’t feel as repelled by my mana because you’re already dyed in my colors.”</p><p>She gave no reaction for a few moments, and then her eyes widened, her cheeks flushed, and she brought her hands to her face. “W-w-what?! But I thought…! Mother said…! How?!”</p><p>Ferdinand could understand that reaction. It was similar to what he’d felt when he first learned the truth. With a sigh, he said, “You know a mother has the greatest influence on a child’s mana, yes? Well, as a devouring child, your mother had no mana, so your mana was close to colorless. In addition to this, you died or nearly died several times, causing parts of your mana to harden into feystone-like clumps. This is called the Mark of Ewigeliebe.</p><p>“You also know the purpose of synchronization potions, do you not? Typically, the effects of these potions wear off within a month, so when I gave you the synchronization potion so I could read your memories, you were only meant to be dyed temporarily. However, thanks to your unique constitution and the Mark of Ewigeliebe, you were instead permanently dyed.”</p><p>Her eyes darted around the room, her embarrassment only seeming to grow. “S-so that was a synchronization potion…? And it tasted sweet…?!”</p><p>“Rozemyne, whatever you’re thinking of, put it out of your mind,” he snapped. “The only improper thing that occurred was treating you as a criminal. …And perhaps the hug that followed.”</p><p>Groaning, she held her head in her hands and cried, “This is terrible!”</p><p>“I agree. No one can find out, especially your guardians. I can only imagine what Bonifatius would do…”</p><p>“No, not that,” she sighed. “I really, really hate being a teenager. I never had to deal with all these stupid [%+?#%*=] before!”</p><p>He didn’t know the word she’d used, but he could guess she was referring to the youthful mind’s tendency to stray into winter well before autumn arrived. That caused his own ears to warm and his stomach to twist, as he realized those thoughts would have been about <em>him.</em> He did not appreciate being thought of in that way by someone in the height of her summer. It made him feel as though he were committing a terrible crime, even if he understood such thoughts were only natural as the body grew.</p><p>Still, he had managed to suppress his for so long that he’d truly thought them dead until he’d seen a grown up Rozemyne. It was a bit embarrassing to recall all the ways he tried to manipulate situations so he would have an excuse to touch her, such as whispering directly into her ear rather than handing her a sound-blocking tool or holding her tighter than was necessary on his highbeast.</p><p>“Did I satisfactorily answer your question?” he asked, dismissing those thoughts from his mind,</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>“Good. Then go. I have some things to see to in here.”</p><p>Her narrowed eyes bored into him as though throwing accusations at him, but he didn’t answer. Instead, he got up and opened the door for her. She finally took the cue and left, though her gaze did not soften by any degree.</p><p>Once he was alone, he went to his desk and started looking at the papers he had scattered about. He wasn’t trying to avoid Rozemyne or his embarrassment. He was merely reviewing results from his recent botany experiments.</p><p> </p><p>After the Harvest Festival, Ferdinand got to work on removing his possessions from the temple. Justus and Eckhart helped transfer the things the gray robes packed to his estate where Lasfam and Janrik would put them away. He was packing up his hidden room himself, only allowing others in to move the boxes out.</p><p>That was until Rozemyne appeared. Ferdinand tried to turn down her offer of help, but she responded with, “As the High Bishop, I believe I’m the highest authority in this temple, am I not? You will accept my help.”</p><p>“Fine,” he sighed. “Just don’t break anything. And don’t get distracted by trying to read any of my books or documents.”</p><p>“Fine,” she agreed. They worked in relative silence, only breaking it occasionally when she asked a question about how to pack certain items. By the second day, however, she’d gotten a grasp on how he wanted things done, so he was able to focus entirely on packing his more delicate belongings.</p><p>Third bell rang, and Ferdinand took a short break to check on how the blue priests were coming along with their paperwork. Hartmut would normally be doing this task, but he was absent today, using his day off to have a final fitting for his robes.</p><p>Eckhart set down a box he carried from the hidden room onto the transportation circle they were using and said, “Lord Ferdinand, this one is about to wear out.”</p><p>“Very well.” He went back to his hidden room and called, “Rozemyne, create another circle.”</p><p>“Again?” she sighed. “I wish we had [copy and %#&lt;*+].” Her eyes lit up as his ears turned red. While she began experimenting with the spell she’d created in the previous weave, he covered his mouth and looked away, trying to banish thoughts of that horrible, horrible day from his mind.</p><p>He instead turned his attention to watching her spell. As last time, it was different from what she had said previously - copy and place, not copy and whatever it was. He could only assume she’d misspoken a moment ago.</p><p>It worked, of course, so she quickly created a dozen transfer circles and provided them to Eckhart who sent half to the estate.</p><p>As she came back and started playing with the spell again, he offered a silent prayer of gratitude that his Book of Mestionora was already complete. He was disappointed, however, that he’d never get his revenge. It would have been quite amusing to watch her squirm as he spread his mana over her book and—</p><p>He shook his head and turned away, barking at Rozemyne to finish helping him pack. As he packed the next box, he practiced drawing complex magic circles in his mind to get his body back under control.</p><p>A crash rang out from behind him, followed by a short scream. He spun around as Rozemyne frantically apologized and went to scoop up what she’d knocked over.</p><p>A silver box and a light yellow feystone.</p><p>“Rozemyne! No!”</p><p>It was already too late. The moment her hand came in contact with her feystone, she jerked back and collapsed, her entire body convulsing.</p><p>“Rozemyne!” Ferdinand dropped to his knees beside her and shoved the feystone out of her reach. When she lost contact, her body became motionless. “No…! No no no no no!” He gasped, pulling her into his arms as he ran medical checks on her. Her pulse and temperature were elevated, and her mana was pulsing wildly through her channels. He glanced over at her feystone, noting that only a portion of the mana had been absorbed.</p><p>“Lord Ferdinand!”</p><p>He jerked his head up to find Justus standing over him. “What happened?”</p><p>Ferdinand shook his head in response as he pulled an empty feystone from his pocket and pressed it against her forehead.</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>“What?!” they both cried out.</p><p>“What do we do?” Eckhart asked, having come in moments after Justus. “Mana is rolling off her body.”</p><p>“Her jureve!” Ferdinand shouted. The one she’d made during their lessons wasn’t of the best quality, but it would do in an emergency. He rushed out of the hidden room with Rozemyne in his arms, barking at her retainers to follow. They raced down the hall to the High Bishop’s chambers.</p><p>“Monika!” he shouted. “Change her into something white!”</p><p>The attendant went pale as Fran took her from Ferdinand to carry her to the bed and then closed the curtains to protect her modesty. Monika got a white dress from Rozemyne’s wardrobe, and she, Gretia, Leiseleta, and Brunhilde got to work changing her clothes.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ferdinand marched into the hidden room, pulled the white tub to the middle of the floor, and put the magic circle in place. Justus, whom he’d given permission to enter, prepared the pitcher and handed it to Ferdinand, who began pouring the potion into the tub. “Justus,” he said, “fetch the tube from that shelf there.”</p><p>As he was preparing the tub, Cornelius came to the doorway with Rozemyne in his arms. “She’s changed!” he yelled. “What do you need me to do?”</p><p>“Justus, have her drink the jureve. Cornelius, hold her upright. Place her head on your shoulder.”</p><p>Justus walked over to the pair and placed the tube in her mouth, using it to pour the jureve down her throat.</p><p>“There, that should be enough. Quick, hand her to me!” he said, stepping out of the room to take her.</p><p>Cornelius passed her over to Ferdinand who brushed her hair out of her face before he gently lay her down in the tub. Fran entered with a bag of empty feystones and started placing them in the potion, sadly overly familiar with the routine.</p><p>“How long will it be this time?” Fran asked, his eyes wavering.</p><p>Ferdinand shook his head. “I don’t know.” Then. He slammed his fist against the floor and shouted, “Damn you, Mestionora!”</p><p>Thankfully, only Fran heard his outburst as Justus had already closed the door.</p>

<p>Ferdinand stepped out of the hidden room, completely haggard. Her retainers waited in the High Bishop’s chambers, staring at him as though they could glean answers from his face alone.</p><p>He sighed and pressed a finger to his furrowed brow. How could he explain what he himself did not comprehend? “This does not leave this room. Understand?” After they swore on their schtappes, he said, “She fell unconscious, and her mana was rampaging yet unresponsive to an empty feystone.”</p><p>“What?!” Cornelius shouted. “How is that possible?”</p><p>Ferdinand shook his head. “If you’d asked me a bell ago, I would have told you it was impossible. I’ve put her in her jureve and confirmed her mana is filling the feystones, so at least we’ve stopped the mana rampage. I don’t know how long she’ll stay asleep this time. She came into contact with a magic tool that should have been inert. I’m uncertain how it was activated.”</p><p>Matthias’ eyes narrowed as his mind seemed to race. “What did the tool do?”</p><p>“I’m uncertain. It’s not one I’ve ever used before. It was something I had planned on studying one day.”</p><p>“How did Lady Rozemyne come in contact with it?” Cornelius asked. “Shouldn’t you have secured something so dangerous?”</p><p> </p><p>With a heavy sigh, Ferdinand said, “She shouldn’t have been able to reach it. It was secured, but when she knocked it off the top of the shelf, the container it was in broke, and she went to clean up the mess before I could stop her.”</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne,” Damuel muttered. “She’s always finding new ways to get into trouble.”</p><p>As they continued asking questions he couldn’t answer, he told them to stop wasting his time and either return to their paperwork or the castle. He couldn’t spend all day saying, “I don’t know,” over and over when he needed to prepare. If she were due for another long sleep, he had much to do. He would need to contact the Plantin, Gilberta, and Othmar companies, her family from the lower city, Sylvester, Karstedt, Elvira… The list went on and on.</p><p>There was no sense in stirring everyone up, though, when he wasn’t sure how long she would sleep. As such, he decided to wait to contact any of their lower-city associates in case she woke up within the next two weeks. However, he would still need to contact the castle immediately.</p><p>“High Priest?”</p><p>He turned around to face Monika who shrank back from him, but she gathered her resolve and said, “Lady Rozemyne is beloved by the gods. I know that she’ll be fine. They’ll make it so.”</p><p>Ferdinand sighed. “She is indeed beloved by them.” Though one of them was responsible for the current predicament. Tamping down his rage for now, he gave orders to Rozemyne’s temple attendants to continue working as though she were merely staying at the castle. He then went to his own chambers and entered his hidden room. With a bitter taste in his mouth, he picked up the silver box and placed the partially-drained feystone inside. Then, he turned to the shelf where he’d tucked it away.</p><p>On the ground before it lay a piece of parchment, one of its edges somewhat crumpled. His mind easily recreated the scene. She’d noticed the parchment hanging off the shelf, and being the reading gremlin that she was, she stretched up on her tiptoes to reach it. When she finally snagged it, she yanked it down, bringing the box along with it.</p><p>He never thought she would be able to reach the top shelf, so it didn't come to him that she’d discover his oath or her feystone. Why hadn’t he packed it first rather than putting it off for as long as he could? If only he hadn’t been too weak to face the box and what it contained, then none of this would have happened.</p><p>He cursed himself over and over again as he held the silver box and flew to his estate. Once there, he went to his hidden room and tucked it away at the bottom of one of his desk drawers. When he exited, all four of his retainers were waiting for him, looking concerned.</p><p>“Lord Ferdinand, what happened?” Lasfam asked.</p><p>Sighing, he told them the same story he’d shared with Rozemyne’s retainers, emphasizing that he didn’t know when she would wake.</p><p>“Oh, Lord Ferdinand…” Lasfam said, his hand going to his chest in an empathetic gesture.</p><p>Janrik, on the other hand, was nearly in a panic. “Lady Rozemyne… What? No, it can’t be.”</p><p>Justus smacked him on the back of the head and snapped, “Get ahold of yourself!”</p><p>He rubbed at the injured spot and glared at Justus before getting control of his emotions again. “She will wake up, though, won’t she?” he asked.</p><p>Ferdinand nodded, because if she didn’t, he’d be paying the tree another visit.</p><p>“I must go report this to the castle,” he said. “Lasfam and Janrik, continue seeing to my belongings.”</p><p>“Yes, my lord.”</p><p>Justus had already sent word to Sylvester that they were coming with urgent news. Therefore, when they alighted from their highbeasts, Norbert took them directly to the aub’s office. Sylvester cleared it the moment Ferdinand stepped inside. Once the door closed and the sound-blocking magic tool activated, Sylvester said, “Come have a seat and tell me what happened. You look like death.”</p><p>Ferdinand collapsed in his chair and squeezed his eyes shut. “Rozemyne is in a jureve.”</p><p>“WHAT?!” Sylvester and Karstedt yelled.</p><p>Shaking his head, he said, “She collapsed and we couldn’t get her mana under control. She was helping me pack my things at the temple when she came into contact with a magic tool that I hadn’t secured well enough. She just started seizing and…”</p><p>He stopped talking as water started dripping on his hands. He looked up to find the source but saw nothing. It was only when Sylvester stood up and placed a hand on his shoulder that he realized he was crying.</p><p>How embarrassing. At least he’d been alone in the supply room the last time he cried, so no one was there to see his weakness.</p><p>The two men let him weep in silence, Sylvester clasping his shoulder and Karstedt pouring him a glass of one of Sylvester’s finest vize.</p><p>Ferdinand was so frustrated. He was sick of dancing to the tune of the gods. It felt like anytime he found a sliver of happiness, they ripped it away from him again while demanding he bowed to their every whim. All he wanted was Rozemyne, so why were they so determined to take her from him?</p><p>When he got control of himself again, he drained his glass of vize in one go, and Sylvester went back to his seat. “Did it look like the jureve was helping?” he asked, to which Ferdinand nodded. “Well, that’s something at least.”</p><p>“Don’t announce anything yet,” Ferdinand said, trying to focus on facts and plans, not emotions and what he was in danger of losing. “Not until we know for sure that she’ll be in the jureve for longer than a fortnight.”</p><p>“Yeah, good idea,” Sylvester said. “We’ll just say she’s still at the temple if anyone asks.”</p><p>Karstedt crossed his arms as he said, “We’ll need to tell Elvira.”</p><p>“And Florencia and the kids.”</p><p>“Maybe not Father, though,” Karsted added. “If she wakes soon, then we would have given ourselves headaches for no reason.”</p><p>After they hashed out the finer details of their plan, Ferdinand headed back to the temple where he returned to Rozemyne’s hidden room. He stood staring at her for what seemed to be ages, willing her to move her fingers or flutter her eyelids. He almost laughed at himself for his foolishness. When had his goddess ever moved according to his will?</p><p>Eventually, he pulled her spring-loaded chair over next to the tub and sat as he watched over her.</p><p> </p><p>Ferdinand woke up with a start. As he sat up, his muscles complained at him for sleeping in an odd position, but he ignored them as he leaned over to check on Rozemyne.</p><p>Her jureve was dark blue.</p><p>The chair squealed against the floor as he leapt to his feet and rushed to the door, flinging it open. “Fran!” he called.</p><p>The gray-robed priest came running from down the hall, his face ashen. “Yes, High Priest?”</p><p>“Feystones!”</p><p>With a confused nod, Fran walked into the hidden room and gasped at the state of the potion. “It’s only been a little over half a day!” Fran said as he knelt and started pulling filled feystones from the jureve, replacing them with empty ones.</p><p>“It’s highly peculiar,” Ferdinand agreed. “I shall stay here to monitor her. Bring me a bench to rest on and some form of bedding.”</p><p>“Yes, High Priest.”</p><p>Fran did as he was told without a word except to say he would be in the High Bishop’s chambers should Ferdinand need him.</p><p>Ferdinand moved to the bench where it rested against the far wall of the room. He was tempted to pull it near Rozemyne, but then if he suddenly needed Fran again, he wouldn’t be able to summon him until the bench was back against the wall.</p><p>With a resigned sigh, Ferdinand stretched out across the hard surface and dozed off.</p><p> </p><p>He woke up with the first bell and found the jureve dark again. Fran had to come back again a little after the fourth bell and again at seventh. Ferdinand truly could not leave her side lest she be left to soak in her concentrated mana for too long. Thankfully, Wilfried and Charlotte had been told about Rozemyne’s condition, so they came to the temple to offer what assistance they could. It was thanks to their efforts of emptying the feystones into the divine instruments that they had enough to keep dropping back into the jureve.</p><p>Ferdinand himself refused to leave the room, instead he took potions and used waschen on himself like he always did when caught up in research before Rozemyne entered his life. With the frequency he had to call in Fran, no one offered any complaints, not even Cornelius.</p><p>For six days, this pattern continued until around the fourth bell on the sixth day when her fingers twitched. Ferdinand almost collapsed with relief. The next day, her eyes started fluttering, and in the middle of the night, she began to rise from the jureve.</p><p>He reached in and pulled her upright, patting her back to dislodge any potion remaining in her lungs. After she coughed for a moment, she looked up at him, her eyes wide with something akin to fear.</p><p>“Come,” he said, standing and offering her a hand, “let’s get you out of the jureve.”</p><p>As he helped her to her feet, he froze.</p><p>Her wet clothes were clinging to every. Single. Curve. And curves she had, despite being only thirteen.</p><p>She traced his gaze down to her body and then shrieked, dropping to a deep crouch and covering her chest with her arms. He turned away, the internal fight between his self-revulsion and inappropriate feelings making him nauseous.</p><p>“I apologize, Rozemyne,” he said. “I was caught off guard and did not respond appropriately. Now, step out of the tub and waschen yourself so that I might turn around.”</p><p>When he heard her chant the spell, he cast it on himself, too, to remove the jureve from his sleeves. “Now then,” he said, facing her again and then paused. She was standing next to the tub, her face aflame, eyes downcast, and fists clenched at her sides. With a sigh, he beckoned her over to her springy chair and sat across from her. “Rozemyne?”</p><p>“I’ve never been so embarrassed in all my life,” she muttered.</p><p>He couldn’t help but chuckle. “Are you not the same person who casted away her shame and bathed in front of me?”</p><p>Her hands flew to her face as she groaned. “Stop! Don’t bring that up! That was completely different. I was a little kid, and I didn’t feel this way about…” Her words trailed off into an unintelligible mumble.</p><p>Was he this easily embarrassed at this age? He didn’t think so, but he spent most of his time either studying in the Academy or avoiding assassination attempts. Of course, it wasn’t as if he interacted with females as much, so perhaps he would have been were their situations reversed.</p><p>Shaking her head, Rozemyne looked up and asked, “How long was I asleep this time? I don’t think I grew anymore.”</p><p>“You’ve been in the jureve for a week. It’s currently the middle of the night.”</p><p>She glanced around the room, and her eyes locked onto the bench on the far wall. “Did you sleep here?!” she gasped.</p><p>“You were filling feystones so fast that someone needed to watch over you at all times,” he sighed. “Now, can you tell me what happened?”</p><p>Her gaze shifted to her lap as her fingers began to twist around each other. “I’m sorry. I saw a piece of parchment really high up, so I was going to put it with the other documents, but I didn’t realize something was on top of it.”</p><p>“What happened after you touched the feystone?” he asked.</p><p>She hesitated then said, “I…I think I saw memories of a different timeline.”</p><p>“What…?” Was that vindictive goddess trying to toy with her memories again? Was that why she sent back the feystone? Had she planned to give Rozemyne memories from the previous weave thinking to manipulate her into filling the garden’s foundation? That deity of pettiness didn’t care at all about anything but her tree, and it made her so shortsighted. How had she not realized the foolishness of trying to provide memories to the same person she’d taken from them in order to enable her to function like a noble again?</p><p>“I know it sounds crazy, but I am originally from another world, so maybe alternate timelines aren’t so far fetched. In my old world, there were all kinds of stories like that. There was even the idea that every decision you make creates another universe, one in which you made the other choice, so…”</p><p>He let her continue babbling for a bit before he sighed and cut her off. “Tell me about these memories from the other timeline.”</p><p>“Most of it was feelings, I think. A lot of loneliness, some anger…a lot of worry about you. There were some things that were similar but very different, like you got engaged to Detlinde instead of Wilfried. I was engaged to Wilfried instead, which is pretty gross by the way, and I could tell even from the little bit I saw that that was not going to be a happy marriage. I’m glad no one in this timeline was foolish enough to try to force me and my brother together.”</p><p>Ferdinand closed his eyes, silently apologizing for being one of those fools.</p><p>“They’re mostly just flashes of things,” she continued. “I recall things like my bible getting stolen, but not who stole it. I do remember finding it wrapped in cloth, though. There was Matthias and Laurenz swearing their names, but they were at the Academy, not the temple. There was also you leaving for Ahrensbach…” She trailed off, her face a mask of despair.</p><p>He reached out and took her hand, silently cursing that fool of a goddess. After a week that shaved years off his life, this was all she had to show for it? A few disjointed, unimportant memories? What was even the point of all this suffering?</p><p>“I’m not going anywhere,” he said in a low, quiet voice.</p><p>“I know,” she said. “It’s just hard to separate these feelings from my real ones right now, but I’m just so relieved you’re here and not…” Her hand squeezed his. “I don’t know what I would do if I lost you, either.”</p><p>His heart felt too big for his chest. “Come here,” he said, leading her to the bench so they could sit next to each other, and then held out his arms. She leaned into his side and wrapped him in a tight embrace, which he returned, resting his chin atop her head. They stayed like that for moments or bells, he couldn’t tell.</p><p>Eventually, she pulled away enough to meet his eye. “You won’t leave me, right?”</p><p>His brows furrowed. “Of course not.”</p><p>“Even if the king orders it?”</p><p>“I’d find a way out of it,” he scoffed.</p><p>“Good. Because if you didn’t, I’d have to steal the whole country out from under him, and that would severely cut into my reading time.”</p><p>He brought his fist to his mouth as he chuckled. “We wouldn’t want that. You have so little already.”</p><p>“So you admit it!” she gasped. “Reading time! Give me back my reading time!”</p><p>“Very well,” he said. “We can stop meeting like this so you can read.”</p><p>“Wait! No! That’s not what I wanted at all!”</p><p>He chuckled again, having to turn away from her indignant expression. “You’ll have time at the Royal Academy to read. That will have to do for now.”</p><p>She puffed out her cheeks and rested her head against his shoulder again.</p><p>Not able to keep her upset for too long, he said, “Tuuli brought something for you while you slept. Shall I give it to you?”</p><p>“Yes!” she shouted, letting him go and clapping her hands together. When he handed her the box, she opened it and gasped.</p><p>Inside was a hair ornament in the noble colors of winter. Red flowers faded to white at the tips of their petals, lace accented the larger flowers, and green petals trailed down in three lines. Most impressive, however, was how Tuuli incorporated the feystones Ferdinand had given to her, appearing like morning dew on the flowers. They were small and didn’t offer much in the way of protection, but together, they could land a nasty blow against an assailant.</p><p>“It’s beautiful,” she sighed, holding it up and tilting it back and forth to watch the light sparkle on the feystones.</p><p>“Yes, it should complement your hair and skin tone well. As always, Tuuli proves exceptional at selecting the best shades of colors for you.”</p><p>“She‘s such an angel. Thank you, Ferdinand!” As she graced him with her shameless smile, he reached down and tucked her hair behind her ear.</p><p>“You realize I’m the only person who should see such an expression, yes?”</p><p>A light blush dusted her cheeks as she looked away. “I know. Mother’s been helping me work on it. It’s just hard to contain it when I’m so happy.”</p><p>“Hmm. So long as you know, I suppose.” He pulled his hand back from her and said, “It’s nearly time for the first bell. Your attendants will want to check on you soon.”</p><p>“Don’t you need some rest?” she asked.</p><p>“I’m fine.”</p><p>“You stink of potions.”</p><p>“Your jureve splashed all over my robes when I pulled you out.”</p><p>“That’s not at all what you smell like.”</p><p>“Perhaps your nose is broken.”</p><p>“Fine!” she huffed. “I’ll just have to ask Fran about your sleeping and eating habits for the past week.”</p><p>“I’ll rest,” he conceded. “Tonight. We have much to do now that you’re awake.”</p><p>“I just woke up, and you’re already putting me to work?” she gasped.</p><p>He raised a brow at her, and she looked away with a sigh, her face saying, <em>You’re right. I should have expected as much.</em></p><p>Shortly after the first bell rang, he escorted her from the room, causing shocked cries and happy exclamations to fill her chambers.</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne! You’re awake!” Fran said, sighing with relief.</p><p>“We were all so worried you’d sleep for another year!” Monika said with her hands clasped in front of her chest, Nicola nodding along.</p><p>“I’ll go tell Wilma and Fritz!” Gil exclaimed before he bolted from the room.</p><p>As her female attendants took her away to be bathed, Ferdinand whipped out several ordonnanzes to announce to her retainers that she had awoken. He would wait until later to let the rest of the castle know since they wouldn’t be awake yet.</p><p>“High Priest?”</p><p>He turned to find Gido and Zahm looking at him with concern. “What is it?” he asked.</p><p>“Should you not retire to your rooms to bathe and eat as well?”</p><p>Ferdinand tapped his finger against his temple in annoyance. “Fine, but I will have my breakfast with Rozemyne.”</p><p>“Understood.”</p><p>Her retainers had arrived at the temple by the time he returned to the High Bishop’s chambers, each smiling at their lady with a mixture of joy and relief as she chatted happily with them.</p><p>“Oh, Ferdinand! Thank you for contacting everyone!”</p><p>To his surprise, no one gave him any reproachful glares even though they knew he’d been with her in the hidden room the entire week. He understood the circumstances were different than the other times they were alone together, but he didn’t expect Cornelius of all people to be able to grasp that concept.</p><p>After they ate, Brunhilde sent word to the castle, and upon their arrival, they were summoned to the aub’s office.</p><p>“Rozemyne!” Sylvester said, coming around his desk and leaning down to her eye level. “Let me get a look at you! Hm? What’s this? You didn’t grow at all this time. Guess you’re going to be this short forever.”</p><p>She gave him a saccharine smile and replied, “I thank you ever so much for your concern, Sylvester. My apologies, but I feel I must inform you that I am of average height for a girl my age.”</p><p>“Oh, she didn’t take the bait. I’ll never doubt Elvira’s training again.”</p><p>“Oh, what’s this?” Florencia asked from behind him. “You doubted her before? My, I wonder how she would take this news.”</p><p>“Not well,” Karstedt said, shaking his head.</p><p>“And she’s the head of the publishing industry. Her vengeance could spread all over Ehrenfest before any of us even gets word of it,” Ferdinand added.</p><p>“Hey!” Sylvester protested. “Rozemyne just woke up from a week-long jureve. Shouldn’t you be directing your attention to her? What sort of parents and fiancé are you to ignore her at a time like this?”</p><p>After they exchanged their greetings and expressed their relief at her waking, they made plans for her to go to the Linkberg estate that afternoon to see her mother and Lamprecht, and then Sylvester told her she could go read in the book room until it was time to go. Once she bounded off like a shumil after a treat, Ferdinand turned his glare on his brother.</p><p>“What?” Sylvester asked. “If I didn’t send her away, you would have started teaching her something or the other to ‘make up for lost time.’ You need to rest. You look terrible.”</p><p>Ferdinand clicked his tongue and strode from the room. When he got to his estate, he collapsed on his bed and didn’t move again until the following morning.</p>

<p>Rozemyne had been acting differently since waking from the jureve. Ferdinand had been so relieved and sleep deprived when she woke that he hadn’t noticed how eerily calm she was after spending a week comatose and gaining a mixed bag of useless memories.</p><p>However, the next morning, he received a magic letter from Elvira asking what exactly had happened to her daughter. She’d been a little shaken at dinner, but Rihyarda found her sobbing in her bed in the middle of the night. She’d refused to say anything more than she’d merely had a nightmare. They’d used a feystone to drain her excess mana, but since they didn’t mention any reaction to it, he could determine she had not reacquired her phobia.</p><p>He wrote back that the magic tool had given her disturbingly realistic nightmares while she was in the jureve, which might as well have been the truth.</p><p>The next day, she asked to spend the morning training with her brother. She wanted to research the divine instruments for her first year of the scholar course, so she wanted to use Wilfried as a control of sorts to draw comparisons. Ferdinand was reluctant to let her go since she looked a little tired, but he decided to relent when she agreed to let him observe. They started with producing shields, seeing how large they could make them and how many attacks of varying strength they could take. They gave up trying to break Rozemyne’s, and Wilfried’s lasted all the way until she fired a full-power arrow from her water gun at it.</p><p>After drinking a potion each, they formed the spear. Rozemyne’s was crackling with mana while Wilfried’s needed to be filled, so he practiced trying to summon it fully charged while she got Eckhart to show her how to throw it. With enhancement magic, she was able to get it within range of the target dummies, where it exploded with such force that it shook the ground they stood on, causing all practice in the knight building to cease. Bonifatius ran over and asked Rozemyne, “Was that you?”</p><p>“Yes, Grandfather. I’m sorry I interrupted–”</p><p>“MY GRANDDAUGHTER IS AMAZING!” he bellowed, pumping his fist into the air. “Let’s see it again!”</p><p>As Bonifatius took over Rozemyne’s training, Eckhart walked over to Ferdinand and asked, “Lord Ferdinand, might I start donating my mana to the divine instruments as well?”</p><p>He sighed. “So long as it does not interfere with your duties. Do keep in mind that I will no longer be in the temple come winter.”</p><p>“Yes, my lord. I shall do my best with the time we have left.”</p><p>Rozemyne spent the rest of the morning learning how to throw spears from her grandfather, much to his delight. Wilfried, meanwhile, had managed to summon a partially charged spear by the time Ferdinand and Rozemyne left.</p><p>When they got back to his estate to do scholar work, she asked to focus on poison detection, protection, and antidotes. He began to wonder if waking from the jureve brought to mind the night Gerlach had attacked her. It was his poison, after all, that had caused her to sleep for so long.</p><p>It was for this reason that he didn’t admonish her for standing so close to him or touching him frequently, either tugging on his sleeve, laying a hand on his arm, or letting her fingers brush against his. She obviously needed comfort, but after she let her retainers see her act in such a brazen manner, he wasn’t about to take her into a hidden room. They wouldn’t understand as they were not close enough to recognize the panicked desperation in her touch as though she needed to confirm he was still there to protect her.</p><p>The next day, she had Charlotte join them in the knight building where they tested her shield. It didn’t last nearly as long as Wilfried’s, but it was much improved from the interduchy tournament. She’d truly dedicated herself to mana compression, likely desperate to catch up to her siblings.</p><p>This time after they finished testing their sister’s shield, Rozemyne returned to learning how to throw a spear with Eckhart while Wilfried practiced using Ewigeliebe’s sword. At first, he only gave it as little mana as possible to keep it formed and went through his forms with it. The first time he filled it with mana and swung, feybeasts made of snow swarmed the knights on the field, and the boy collapsed. Alexis administered a potion to him, and he soon recovered enough to try again. Karstedt decided to use him to train the knights, though Wilfried was limited to no more than three swings a day so he didn’t consume all his potions and so he could focus on his own training.</p><p>Thanks to Wilfried’s help, it quickly became apparent who needed more work on coordination, and Ferdinand marked each one of them for intensive training over the winter.</p><p>During the afternoon tutoring session, Ferdinand had Rozemyne make a replacement jureve. He had hoped it would ease the anxiety she was still feeling regarding poisons, but her eyes still wavered when he saw her off after dinner.</p><p>The next day, Ferdinand returned to teaching Rozemyne, Wilfried, and Charlotte archduke candidate course material. They were working on creating buildings in their miniature gardens again. Wilfried had wasted time adding extraneous decorations to his while Charlotte merely recreated her room once again. Rozemyne’s, however, was not a library as Ferdinand had expected. Well, it wasn’t just a library.</p><p>“What’s this?” he asked.</p><p>“A workshop and a library,” she said. “They’re connected so that we can see each other even when we’re indulging in our hobbies. I’d only have to look up from my book to see you.”</p><p>Wilfried snorted. “Like you’d ever look up from a book.”</p><p>“I might!” she said, indignant.</p><p>Charlotte laughed at them and said, “I think it’s a sweet idea, but wouldn’t some of Uncle’s experiments create odors or flashes of light that you would find distracting in your library?”</p><p>Rozemyne froze. “Ah. I should get Raimund to look into odor-blocking magic tools.”</p><p>“Rozemyne,” Ferdinand said, “Raimund is my disciple, not yours.”</p><p>She waved him off. “You’re my fiancé. He’s as good as mine. If he can make a tool that would keep bright flashes of light from carrying over as well…”</p><p>With a sigh, he pushed a finger against her forehead, forcing her to look up at him. “Now is not the time,” he said. “Focus.”</p><p>“Right…”</p><p>When the session ended and the children began heading back to the castle, Rozemyne tugged on his sleeve and asked, “Can I stay here for the afternoon, too?”</p><p>“No,” he said. “You’re meeting with Elvira and Florencia for social training, are you not?”</p><p>She bit her lip and then let go of his sleeve. When she stepped out into the front garden and got into her highbeast, Ferdinand saw her grab her courtship necklace and hold it as she flew towards the castle.</p><p>The days continued in the same pattern more or less. Rozemyne moved on from spear throwing to close combat in the mornings on their special-interest days and turned back to magic tools used in ditter in the afternoons, having read through some of the documents Ferdinand had lent her. Wilfried continued to help train the newer knights and practiced his swordplay before working with Charlotte and Sylvester in the afternoons. Charlotte’s mornings were spent strengthening her shield and trying to determine if she was more suited to Leidenschaft’s spear or Ewigeliebe’s sword.</p><p>When Ferdinand saw all three of them wielding divine weapons like they were practice swords, he wondered what monsters he had unleashed on the world.</p><p> </p><p>Before he knew it, the Autumn Coming of Age Ceremony and lower city Winter Baptism had passed, and Ferdinand stood at the front of the grand hall watching the children perform for the winter debut in his last ceremony as High Priest. After the last child finished, he and Rozemyne quickly left and got changed. Once again, Rozemyne wore a dress made with cloth dyed by Effa. It started as a deep crimson at her neck with white flowers that turned red as they trailed down her bust where the red began to fade into the white of her skirt. The bottom of the skirt had glittering thread embroidered here and there, making it seem as though it was dusted with snowflakes sparkling in the light. It matched well with the hairpin he’d ordered for her.</p><p>They entered the grand hall after the break between the gifting ceremony and announcements, stopping to speak with a few people here and there on their way to the front. Once Sylvester had everyone’s attention again, he called Hartmut to the front to name him the new High Priest. This was met with polite, if confused, applause as his parents received many worried or curious looks. They chose to ignore them.</p><p>After Hartmut expressed his thanks, he went back to his seat as Ferdinand and Karstedt were brought forward. Sylvester appointed Ferdinand the Knight Commander and Karstedt the Vice Commander to the uproarious applause of the Knight’s Order.</p><p>Ferdinand scanned the crowd and found Cornelius. Once they made eye contact, he smirked. The young man visibly gulped. They then stepped down and Sylvester finished with the announcements, ushering in the beginning of winter socializing.</p><p>Rozemyne quickly appeared at Ferdinand’s side, walking with him around the grand hall, giving their greetings to those they knew. Several giebes tried to swarm her to ask about their findings on the stages, but before they could become too irate with the lack of progress, a few dozen knights came over, all eager to greet their new commander and his bride-to-be. It wasn’t quite as bad as getting swarmed by Dunkelfelgerians; they were simply excited rather than thirsting for ditter, so at least they were manageable.</p><p>Eventually, he excused himself to escort Rozemyne to the winter playroom. When they got to the door, her hand tightened on his arm. “Rozemyne, do try to find some more retainers if you can.”</p><p>She remained quiet.</p><p>“Rozemyne?”</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she let go of him and gave him a polite smile. “Yes, I shall try to do as you say.” Then, she stepped into the room, her fingers resting against the pendant of her necklace.</p><p>The rest of her underaged retainers filed past, and her adult guard knights returned to the grand hall with him. There, he tried to socialize with people who weren’t knights but failed at every turn. Eventually, he gave up and accepted his fate. Much of the conversation centered around the three archduke candidates who wielded divine instruments during practice. There were some among the men who expressed an interest in going to the temple if it meant possibly obtaining Leidenschaft’s spear or Schutzaria’s shield.</p><p>The idea intrigued Ferdinand. If knights were constantly moving in and out of the temple, then it’d be that much harder to infiltrate. However, that would also call him to Georgine’s attention, and she’d mark him for elimination. He doubted her power would be enough to do anything more drastic than she already had, given the evidence they’d provided to the prince. Still, one could not be too careful.</p><p> </p><p>The day quickly came for Rozemyne to depart for the Royal Academy. Ferdinand escorted her to the teleportation chamber where everyone waited to see her and her brother off. As Wilfried’s luggage was carried to the transfer circle, he made his rounds saying his goodbyes. When Wilfried reached him, Ferdinand said, “Continue to strive as you have during practice and tutoring sessions. Be mindful of Ahrensbach. They are sure to approach you more now that you are engaged to Detlinde.”</p><p>The boy's eyes found the floor. “Right…”</p><p>Ferdinand could understand that reaction. “Also, keep an eye on Rozemyne. She’s already suffered many attacks from Ahrensbach and those affiliated with them.”</p><p>He looked back up at that, his face full of determination. “Right! I’ll protect both my sisters no matter what.”</p><p>“Good. Be well.”</p><p>Once Wilfried left, Ferdinand gave Rozemyne a light shove to prompt her to start saying her farewells, but she merely caught his sleeve between her thumb and forefinger and gazed up at him, her eyes wavering.</p><p>“Rozemyne,” he said, dislodging her fingers, “mind your behavior. This is unbecoming of one of your station. Now, go bid your farewells.”</p><p>With a stiff nod, she went around the room, saying goodbye and listening to last minute advice with a polite smile. When at last she reached Ferdinand again, her face strained with the effort of maintaining her noble expression.</p><p>He sighed and said, “Rozemyne, you will need to keep an eye on Wilfried this term. He is oblivious to social subtleties, and his straightforward nature makes him an easy target for manipulation. Try to ascertain what you can of Ahrensbach while keeping a safe distance. Raimund should prove valuable in this regard. Do not meet with him outside of Professor Hirschur’s lab, however. Be sure to collect the feystones from the library and ensure that control of Schwartz and Weiss are handed over to the professors there. This should be a more rewarding year for you as it will be the first one where you can experience a fully-staffed library. Also, remember to be mindful of royalty. Prince Anastasius may summon you at some point during the term. As I told you before, with Harmut and the new blue priests, we will not need any of you to return for the Dedication Ritual.”</p><p>Her smile faltered at that, and her pupils began to dilate. He quickly continued speaking in an effort to forestall her impending mana rampage. “Do use the extra time to read and socialize. I believe you have a bookworm friend at the Academy, do you not? I’m sure she is looking forward to exchanging books with you again this year. You will also need to continue spreading the fruits of the printing industry, so use those merchant skills of yours to garner more interest in Ehrenfest books.” Rozemyne seemed to calm somewhat, though he could tell she was still troubled.</p><p>“Lord Ferdinand, it is time for milady to depart,” Rihyarda said.</p><p>At those words, Rozemyne reflexively grabbed his sleeve and asked, “You’ll still be here when I return, right?”</p><p>“Of course,” he said, trying to turn to block everyone else’s view of her hand. “Why waste time asking such a useless question?”</p><p>She glanced around and then slipped him a sound-blocking tool. “You have your charms for warding poison on, right? You’ll wear them all the time, right?”</p><p>Ferdinand’s eyes widened slightly. He had somewhat suspected as much, but it appeared she remembered more than she’d confessed to. She’d all but confirmed she recalled his being poisoned by Letizia and left to die by Detlinde. Nodding, he said, “Yes, I keep them on my person at all times. I expect you to do the same with the charms given to you.”</p><p>“Okay,” she said, slowly letting her hand drop as Rihyarda pulled on her shoulder. After she took back her magic tool, she walked to the circle and spun around, holding eye contact with Ferdinand as the gold and black lights swirled around her. Just before she disappeared, her fingers went to the pendant of her courtship necklace.</p><p>As the servants started to leave, Sylvester asked, “Care to explain what that was about?”</p><p>Ferdinand remained silent as he tried to formulate his response, leaving room for Elvira to answer.</p><p>“She’s been having some trouble since she woke up from her jureve.”</p><p>Raising a brow at her, Sylvester said, “I see. Florencia, Elvira, Ferdinand, Karstedt, come with me to my office.”</p><p>Once the five of them were alone, Sylvester told Elvira to explain what she meant.</p><p>She closed her eyes and sighed. “She had nightmares every night she stayed with us at the mansion.”</p><p>“She’s been having them at the castle as well according to Rihyarda,” Florencia added.</p><p>“Why wasn’t I told of this?” Ferdinand asked.</p><p>“She asked us not to,” Florencia said.</p><p>Elvira nodded. “As the future wife of the knight commander, she doesn’t want to appear weak. She wants to be someone you can rely on, not someone you always have to protect.” She looked at her husband for a moment then said, “I could well understand her feelings and decided to respect her wishes.”</p><p>“So it’s just nightmares?” Karstedt asked, raising a brow.</p><p>“It is not ‘just’ nightmares,” Elvira scolded him. “They are so vivid that she is unable to distinguish them from reality upon waking. It is only after asking several odd questions and putting on her courtship necklace that she calms back down.”</p><p>Sylvester leaned forward. “What sort of questions?”</p><p>She started counting them off on her fingers. “Things like, ‘Who am I engaged to?’ or, ‘How old am I?’ She frequently asks after Ferdinand, wanting to know where he is, if he’s left Ehrenfest, if he’s safe.”</p><p>Rubbing his chin, Karstedt said, “That might explain her sudden interest in training with the knights. If she frequently experiences Ferdinand falling into danger, it would not be strange for her to try to become stronger to protect him.”</p><p>“Ridiculous,” Ferdinand scoffed. “I am not the one slated to leave Ehrenfest.”</p><p>Florencia brought a hand to her cheek and said, “You are not the only one she worries after, just the most frequent. According to Rihyarda, once she calms down, she talks about how she needs to save Wilfried from suffering your fate. I can only assume she’s referring to what she sees in her dreams.”</p><p>That fool! She’d promised she wouldn’t go on any rampages!</p><p>Taking a deep breath, he mastered his anger and rationalized that she understood it would be several years before Wilfried was called to Ahrensbach, so she was likely planning something that would take some time to implement. She’d proven herself capable of forethought before. He would have to trust in that at least until she returned from the Academy.</p><p> </p><p>The first reports from the Academy were promising if suspiciously lacking on the parts of Wilfried and Rozemyne. Neither had mentioned speaking with Detlinde during the fellowship gathering, and Charlotte had only given the briefest of summaries. They had to rely on Roderick’s report to fill in the gaps.</p><p>
<em>Lord Ferdinand,</em>
</p><p>
<em>We attended the fellowship gathering today. Prince Anastasius was cordial to the archduke candidates and asked after the state of Ehrenfest. Lady Charlotte told him that we had enjoyed a peaceful year since last we saw him. He then asked after Lady Rozemyne’s health, as she looked pale, though she insisted she was fine, merely tired from staying up reading too late.</em>
</p><p>
<em>The Klassenberg archnoble apologized for their merchant leaving his daughter behind and expressed his hope that they would be granted more trade slots this year.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Lady Rozemyne was able to extract a promise from Lady Hannelore to have a tea party to exchange their books. Lord Lestilaut and Lord Wilfried made plans to meet for gewinnen once socializing began to hand over a copy of the modern translation of Dunkelfelger history.</em>
</p><p>Nothing noteworthy happened with the other top-ranking duchies, save the expressed desires for trade slots, until they met Detlinde.</p><p>
<em>Lady Detlinde gave brief greetings to Lady Charlotte and ignored Lady Rozemyne. She asked Lord Wilfried when he would be giving her a hairpin worthy of a fiancé of the future archduchess of a greater duchy. She then described at great length how grateful he should be to her as she was saving him from the temple and having to associate with a temple-raised girl that he was forced to treat as his sister. When she called Lady Rozemyne a “mere flower raised in filthy soil,” Lord Wilfried interrupted her with a curt, “It seems Dregarnuhr’s weaving is swift,” and led us away to our table.</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand hoped Detlinde was executed in this weave. If they did end up taking over Ahrensbach as he planned, he would run her through himself and blame it on the Lanzenave invaders.</p><p>That aside, while he could understand not wishing to write about an upsetting exchange, it was suspicious that Rozemyne and Wilfried both chose to report nothing of the interaction. Sylvester and Ferdinand penned letters to them asking for an explanation. They got vague responses that amounted to, “It wasn’t worth mentioning.” How they felt a troublemaker spreading rumors about an archduke candidate from the Seventh being a flower from the temple was “not worth mentioning” was beyond him. He wrote admonishing letters to them both but received no response.</p><p>The next headache-inducing report came only two days later from Matthias of all people.</p><p>
<em>Lord Ferdinand,</em>
</p><p>
<em>At the professors’ request, we went to the library today. Princess Adolphine has been made the third arch librarian, and since she will be the shumils’ new master, Lady Rozemyne had to give permission for her to touch them. Prince Anastasius was present to watch as a member of royalty unaffiliated with the library. Once the process was complete, he invited Lady Rozemyne to join him in his villa once her afternoon classes were finished.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Upon our arrival, Prince Anastasius tried to have the room cleared, but Lady Rozemyne requested to at least have her name-sworn guard knight present as she could swear him to secrecy. The prince gave her a hard look, but it softened into something like concern or pity before he relented. She had me stay, none of the others, and ordered me to not speak a word of what was said in the room except to either you or Aub Ehrenfest.</em>
</p><p>
<em>The prince explained that he had been gathering evidence after questioning one of the prisoners from Ehrenfest, who had been in contact with a student from Ahrensbach. The student was originally from Werkestock, and when he tracked them down, he found they had already ascended the towering staircase. Aub Ahrensbach had the matter investigated, and they found a written confession among the student’s possessions expressing regret over their actions, not understanding the full impact they would have. They were merely upset at losing Ehrenfest’s support that they so deeply depended on. So as not to bring any shame or guilt upon their family, they chose to ascend to the towering heights.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Lady Georgine, who had worked so tirelessly on behalf of Old Werkestock, was so overcome with emotion at this betrayal that she took sick, causing the aub to order the family’s execution. While this angered the prince, there was little more he could do to pursue that avenue of investigation.</em>
</p><p>
<em>He had to shift his focus to helping with gathering and interrogating the families of the nobles responsible for the attack on the royal family, but most either knew nothing or had memories they were unable to decipher. While they suspect trug was involved, since families from regions managed by both Dunkelfelger and Ahrensbach were affected, they were unable to decisively pin it on either duchy as evidence more likely suggested it was entirely devised by Old Werkestock nobles without outside influence.</em>
</p><p>
<em>He had questioned Lady Georgine as well about giving an Ehrenfest student her compression method in exchange for information, but there was nothing suspicious about her reasons. Since her home duchy had withdrawn its support, she simply used an easy means to obtain information on us. She expressed regret that it ended the way it did as she only meant to learn what she could about how her younger brother and her old home were faring.</em>
</p><p>
<em>At this point, he told Lady Rozemyne that he was aware some of our students whose families had not been part of the purge had ties with those in Ahrensbach, so he ordered her to have them try to gather information on his behalf as everyone would be on guard against any inquiries made by royalty. However, some may more readily speak to family or friends. He also asked her to have Lord Wilfried probe Lady Detlinde for information as her fiancé. Though he expressed his regret that he had been unable to prevent the engagement, he would use it to our mutual advantage.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Sincerely,</em>
</p><p>
<em>Matthias</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand immediately passed the report over to Sylvester who after reading it, dropped it on the desk and held his head in his hands. When Karstedt reached for it, they both stopped him. “No,” Sylvester said, “the prince ordered Rozemyne to have him only speak of what was said to me and Ferdinand.”</p><p>“However,” Ferdinand said, “neither of us is under such an order.” After he summarized the contents of the letter, Karstedt, too, ended up holding his head in his hands.</p><p>Sylvester let out a frustrated groan and spat, “Why?! Why is he giving all this information to Rozemyne? He could have just as easily told her to have Wilfried and Ehrenfest students probe Ahrensbach for information without another word.”</p><p>Drumming a finger against his temple, Ferdinand ran over the contents of the letter again. Why had Rozemyne chosen to keep Matthias present? He certainly had the talent to be a scholar, as evidenced from his report and his work in the temple. Perhaps she thought Anastasius wouldn’t allow an actual scholar to stay, so she used the name-sworn knight most likely to remember the conversation. Eventually, he said, “It’s certainly not what one would expect. Hartmut had reported last year that he believed Rozemyne had won Prince Anastasius as a steadfast ally with some simple flattery. At the time, I had dismissed his claim as the ludicrous ravings of a fanatic, but I’m beginning to doubt my original assessment. However, it’s likely he is trying to draw Rozemyne into a false sense of security so she reveals information more freely. Ehrenfest looks rather suspicious after all.”</p><p>“How so?!” Sylvester asked. “We’ve been the victims the whole time!”</p><p>“Yes,” Ferdinand agreed. “The victims who have come out no worse for wear. If anything, our position has improved since these attacks began. Rozemyne was poisoned, yet she arose from the jureve blessed by the gods. A ternisbefallen attacked our gathering spot, yet it is now more vibrant and productive than ever. A group of radicals attacked those gathered at the Interduchy Tournament, and yet despite one of the feybeasts falling in close proximity to our students, not a single Ehrenfest student suffered more than scrapes and bruises.”</p><p>“But my kids protected dozens of others and healed even more!”</p><p>“Which is why I suspect the prince is using such light-handed tactics,” Ferdinand said. “Had your children been any less benevolent, I imagine all of us would have found ourselves under interrogation eventually.</p><p>“For now, we should advise them to cooperate but refrain from freely offering any information that the prince does not specifically ask for. Any speculation or opinions Rozemyne gives may work against us in ways we cannot predict.</p><p>“Still, I’m concerned about this line here where he says the prince looked at her with pity. Knowing Matthias, I can assume that he’s under orders not to say why and that this is the closest he can get to reporting Rozemyne’s condition to us.”</p><p>Sylvester’s brows furrowed. “Yeah, Roderick said the prince mentioned her being pale at the fellowship gathering, right? She said it was from reading, and since none of the other reports mentioned anything…”</p><p>“Could it be more about the prince’s actions than Rozemyne’s health?” Karstedt asked.</p><p>“Perhaps,” Ferdinand said. “With what Elvira and Florencia said, however…”</p><p>With a groan, Sylvester grumbled, “I want to ask, but I don’t want to risk outing her name sworn, either. I’ll send a message to Rihyarda to let us know if there’s anything that should concern us about her health. If we don’t get a response, then they were probably talking about the prince instead.” Letting out a deep sigh, he added, “Neither answer is a good one, though.”</p><p> </p><p>The next concerning letters came from Wilfried and Rozemyne, though the latter’s was written in invisible ink.</p><p>
<em>Father,</em>
</p><p>
<em>We had the divine protection ritual today. There were actually quite a few students there, and several said they were able to pass the test to do the ritual so soon thanks to picture books or karuta.</em>
</p><p>
<em>When they showed us the prayer, I immediately recognized it from that thing Uncle had me and Charlotte do when we were kids. Even the circle I had to pray on was the same.</em>
</p><p>“I’m sorry. <em>What?!</em>” Sylvester yelled.</p><p>With a shrug, Ferdinand said, “They had been giving their mana to the divine instruments. I wanted to test to see if it had any effect on their elements.”</p><p>“So why didn’t you have Rozemyne do it?”</p><p>“She already has all seven colors, so the test would have been pointless.” He refused to answer any more questions until Sylvester finished the letter, hoping whatever Wilfried said would be satisfactory enough.</p><p>
<em>Rozemyne went first, and her smile was kind of strained when she came out, but she wouldn’t say anything to me. I found out why, though, when I did mine right after. I got 31 protections! When I did it the first time, I only had twelve.</em>
</p><p>“Wait a minute!” Karstedt yelled. “He had <em>how</em> many?!”</p><p>Sylvester was gawping at the letter. “This… What…? How…? You just… He got… What in the…?”</p><p>“Continue reading,” Ferdinand snapped, bringing Sylvester out of his stupor.</p><p>
<em>Something really crazy happened, though. The statues started spinning, and a doorway opened up. Professor Hirschur muttered that it was the second time that day, meaning it’d happened for Rozemyne as well since we were the only two who had gone so far. Anyway, I went up the stairs, but all I saw was the tree where I got my schtappe. Since there wasn’t anything else, I just left.</em>
</p><p>“Wait! The statues moved?! A doorway?!” Sylvester cried. “And what tree?! I don’t remember a tree! Do you, Karstedt?”</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>“Ferdinand?!”</p><p>“Are you going to finish the letter or not?” Ferdinand asked, annoyed that Wilfried had revealed something he and Rozemyne had specifically kept quiet in the previous weave. He shouldn’t have used him in an experiment to see how little one needed to give to earn protections from an element one was not born with.</p><p>
<em>I was super excited, so I came out and told Rozemyne how many protections I got. Hannelore was next to her, so she overheard and was impressed. Rozemyne, however, told me not to say anything else.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Anyway, things got pretty crazy at the end. Philine gained a new color from getting Mestionora’s protection, and Roderick became omni elemental. Professor Hirschur told us not to say a word to anyone.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Anyway, can you send all the empty feystones and magic tools we have? Rozemyne’s mana is going nuts. She’s going to end up blessing the entire Academy the next time she sneezes.</em>
</p><p>
<em>–Wilfried</em>
</p><p>The color drained from Sylvester’s face. “Didn’t Rozemyne’s other name-sworn become omni elemental last year…?”</p><p>“Indeed,” Ferdinand said with a grimace. So <em>that</em> was why she had Matthias stay. He’d already done the divine protection ritual when he’d given her his name, so outing him as a name-sworn retainer would not reveal the secret. Had she recovered the memory of Roderick gaining his protections from the previous weave, too?</p><p>“So that means…”</p><p>“That means nothing,” Ferdinand said, glaring at both Sylvester and Karstedt. “And it will continue to mean nothing because we will continue to act as though we don’t know anything about it or why it’s happening. You understand why we cannot reveal the truth of this, yes?”</p><p>Both men nodded.</p><p>“That aside,” Sylvester said, “you can do the ritual more than once?”</p><p>Ferdinand didn’t bother to answer a question with such an obvious answer.</p><p>“Let me rephrase,” he said. “Can an adult repeat the ritual?”</p><p>With a heavy sigh, Ferdinand replied, “Yes, with the prayer and proper circle.”</p><p>“Great! Take me to the temple after the Lord of Winter hunt. I want to see if I get any new protections after helping out with Spring Prayer a couple of times and such.”</p><p>He sighed again. There was no point in pretending he didn’t have the circle when Wilfried already confirmed he did.</p><p>At least there was no mention of Rozemyne’s health being poor, aside from her overflowing mana which would fix itself once she decompressed to the level of her schtappe.</p><p>The next letter in the stack, unsurprisingly, was a request for a meeting with the aub from Hirschur.</p><p>While Sylvester got to work arranging his schedule, Ferdinand ordered Karstedt to go to the knight dorms to start gathering their feystones and magic tools. He then sent Justus to go talk to the scholars about theirs and went to his hidden rooms in the castle and his estate to get what he had. He also included a couple of bags of feystones for Rozemyne to dust. After they transferred over the first batch, he went back to his hidden room and read Rozemyne’s letter.</p><p>
<em>To my fiancé,</em>
</p><p>
<em>We did the divine protection ritual today. Imagine my surprise when Wilfried saw the prayer and said, “Oh, yeah! I can do this again!”</em>
</p><p>
<em>When I asked him, “What do you mean, ‘again’?” do you know what he said?</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Uncle had me and Charlotte memorize a prayer and perform it on a circle. We had to make the whole thing light up to prove we knew it.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>So unlike him, I’m having trouble controlling my mana since my efficiency went up exponentially. It’s more than my schtappe can handle. He should be suffering just as much as me, but he says it’s harder but not impossible to control. Of course, he only got 31 protections. I ended up with 49.</em>
</p><p>
<em>This is your fault for multiple reasons:</em>
</p><p>
<em>1. You did not do the divine protection ritual with me before I got my schtappe.<br/>
2. I ended up with protections that I’m sure I wouldn’t have had without you, namely Bluanfah, Efflorelume, and like, three other romance-related goddesses.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I copied down the circle when I went up the staircase, but I assume you already have your own copy, yes?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Also, since you didn’t tell Professor Hirschur what you found up there, I made Wilfried keep his mouth shut, too. However, I was too late to keep him from blabbing to your former teacher. At least the other students didn’t find out. If you had told me, though, maybe I could have warned Wilfried not to say anything, but how was I supposed to know that any of this would happen?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Anyway, it looks like everyone who gave me their names before they performed the ritual have all elements now. That’s also technically your fault, too, since you dyed me when I was little, right?</em>
</p><p>
<em>See? I’m innocent here! It isn’t my fault at all!</em>
</p><p>
<em>– Rozemyne</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand covered his face with his hands. While she was technically correct, she didn’t have to phrase it <em>that way.</em> She was right, however, that all of these issues could be traced back to him. He’d given her the synchronization potion. He’d gotten the former Veronica faction children to give her their names earlier than before. He’d done the ritual with her younger siblings but not with her because he didn’t want to take away the learning experience of the joint research project. He would accept blame, too, for Bluanfah’s blessing, though he wished it had come later in her summer.</p>

<p>Sylvester’s report from his meeting with Hirschur was roughly the same as last weave, though Laurenze, Gretia, and Muriella had joined them in addition to Wilfried, Rozemyne, Roderick, and Philine. Once again, Hirschur singled out Rozemyne as the unifying factor, noting that it was her brother and her retainers who were all involved. She also suggested they do joint research with Dunkelfelger on obtaining more divine protections, and she declined any funding from Ehrenfest.</p><p>Things seemed to go well for a bit, so Ferdinand was better able to focus on training the knights. One of the first things he did that winter was form an elite strike squad made up of all the knights he’d marked for torture and put Cornelius in the lead. Angelica forced her way in as well, which only helped prove he wasn’t taking revenge on the poor fools. He was merely building Ehrenfest’s offensive capabilities and improving Cornelius’ leadership skills since he was the head of Rozemyne’s guard knights.</p><p>Eckhart, of course, knew exactly what Ferdinand was doing and cheered his little brother and fiancée on from the sidelines.</p><p> </p><p>Naturally, it wasn’t long before things stopped “going well.” The good news was that Rozemyne didn’t send up a blessing during music class since she’d dumped so much of her mana into feystones, magic tools, and the gathering grounds. However, it seemed Wilfried’s mana control was not what he’d claimed it to be. During whirling class, Detlinde had approached him with her customary attitude. According to Charlotte’s letter, he appeared to be getting emotional, though he tried to hide it. He’d started muttering a prayer under his breath to calm himself, but when Detlinde reached out and touched his hair, a blessing of darkness shot from his ring. The foolish girl thought it was a “beautiful gesture from her future God of Darkness.” They then received an invitation for a tea party for cousins, though Rozemyne was excluded by name.</p><p>The next day, they got a letter from Rozemyne asking for permission to conduct the joint research Hirschur had mentioned. Sylvester spent quite a bit of time after that discussing the research project with Aub Dunkelfelger. The aub had wanted to withhold his permission until he received a promise to ditter from Ferdinand, but Sylvester eventually got him to back down by reminding him that adults weren’t supposed to get involved with these matters, so their roles started and ended with giving permission and support.</p><p>After Sylvester sent his approval, Rozemyne and Hannelore were summoned by Prince Anastasius to explain the details of their proposed research. According to Roderick’s report, the prince seemed pleased with the premise and expressed his hope that it would benefit all of Yurgenschmidt. One could interpret his enthusiasm as an order to find a positive correlation and publish the results, as if research results could bend the rules of the realm if ordered to do so by royalty without the Grutrisshiet. Fortunately for all involved, Rozemyne’s hypothesis was completely correct, though Ferdinand wondered if it was merely a hypothesis from her perspective.</p><p>After that, they got another update that Charlotte along with her and Wilfried’s retainers would be working with Drewanchel on plant paper research. While Charlotte was not fully participating since she was a second year not planning to join the scholar course, she was ensuring the Ehrenfest retainers were up to standard and that things progressed smoothly.</p><p>That meant Ferdinand had to give up a portion of his fey paper stash for their project since the blizzards were too strong for the Plantin Company to make any deliveries. While he wasn’t thrilled, he consoled himself with the fact that he’d be able to get more after the Lord of Winter hunt, and he wouldn’t have time to experiment with them until after that point, anyway.</p><p>The next major development came from Wilfried’s report about the archduke candidate course. He and Rozemyne both were wrapping their class up quickly, and she’d progressed to the point of receiving the Supreme Couple’s names.</p><p>
<em>Professor Eglantine took her into a room, and I turned at least a dozen feystones to dust while I waited for her to come out. Even the professor was starting to get worried, so she knocked on the door and called out to her. Next thing I knew, she was calling me over and asked me to check on her.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Turns out Rozemyne collapsed. I hadn’t seen her crumpled over like that since we were little, so I panicked. She said she just needed a minute to finish recovering after taking a potion and hadn’t expected it to happen again. I don’t think anyone did, though, given how healthy she’s been since coming out of the year-long jureve. I helped her get into a more comfortable sitting position against the wall and waited with her until she could walk again. At Rozemyne’s insistence, Professor Eglantine went ahead with the next two lessons while I finished dusting my feystones.</em>
</p><p>
<em>When it was my turn to go in, Rozemyne told me to take a potion and have another on hand, so I did as she said. She was right. I needed both! I don’t think I’m allowed to tell you what exactly happened, but I can say that getting the names sucked a lot of mana out of me. I can see why she collapsed since she was totally unprepared. Shouldn’t professors warn us about this sort of thing? Rozemyne could have been seriously hurt!</em>
</p><p>Sylvester furrowed his brows and narrowed his eyes at Ferdinand. “I don’t recall expending a ton of mana when I got the names. Do you?”</p><p>With a shrug, Ferdinand said, “I suppose it’s different for everyone. I don’t imagine most people have spoken about what happened when they received the names of the Supreme Couple, given the cautionary tale told beforehand.”</p><p>“Eh, I guess that’s true.”</p><p>Ferdinand resisted the urge to tap his temple as Sylvester continued reading about Wilfried needing to finish the rest of the course in the following class since they ran out of time before he could perform entwickeln or create a border gate. It shouldn’t bother him as much as it did that both Rozemyne and Wilfried sent a significant amount of mana to the shrines. It wouldn’t matter, after all, unless they did a shrine tour.</p><p>A shiver ran down his spine. Could anyone stop Rozemyne from completing one, especially if she recalled the path to the Book of Mestionora? Even with as much self control as she’d exercised this weave, he doubted she would be able to resist getting her hands on a book from the gods.</p><p>Did she remember having it to begin with? If so, did she remember any of the contents?</p><p>He…needed to speak with her soon.</p><p> </p><p>The strike team was shaping up rather well. Ferdinand was reasonably certain that the Lord of Winter hunt this year would be just as short as if Rozemyne had given the Knight’s Order Angriff’s blessing. The overall coordination of the younger knights had improved by leaps and bounds as well. Nodding to himself, he assigned Eckhart to work with the youngest knights and Karstedt to lead the older ones in more complex maneuvers. He, meanwhile, worked directly with the strike team, focusing on improving their speed, mana efficiency, and accuracy. Since Cornelius now easily rivaled his father in mana capacity, Ferdinand hoped to increase his skill as fast as possible so that he could stand shoulder to shoulder with himself, Karstedt, and Eckhart when they launched their most devastating attacks.</p><p>When he came in from the rather rewarding training session, he was told to report to the aub’s office. After he and Karstedt gave themselves quick waschens, they went to meet with Sylvester. Roderick had sent an update on their joint research, and Rozemyne sent one regarding Ahrensbach.</p><p>Naturally, they read Rozemyne’s first.</p><p>
<em>To my fiancé,</em>
</p><p>
<em>Professor Fraularm is all that stands between me and finishing the scholar course. Since I couldn’t get her to respond, I reached out to Professor Hirschur who told me to contact the prince. With no other recourse, I did as instructed.</em>
</p><p><em>I want to emphasize that: </em>I did as instructed.</p><p>
<em>He called me to his villa, and I told him the issue. He was less than pleased and said he would like to find a peaceful solution to this if possible, so I mentioned that I wanted to do research with Raimund anyway on magic tools for our library. When he said that Ahrensbach was likely to take all the credit, I told him it was fine. I only wanted the tools. I didn’t care about the glory. He approved of this tactic and said that I was to reach out to him by ordonnanz if I continued to run into issues.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Anyway, I’m now doing joint research with Ahrensbach, and I’ve passed my final class. I was finally able to go to the library this afternoon! There were more students than I’m used to seeing on my first day there, but I guess this will be the norm from now on since I’m taking two courses.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Professor Isolde was gushing about the collection of sheet music we’re planning to sell at the Archduke Conference this year, so I think that one will go over really well. Expect lots of interest from Klassenberg!</em>
</p><p>
<em>Professor Adolphine talked to me for a little bit about Mother’s newest book before bringing up the joint research projects with Drewanchel and Dunkelfelger. She ended up mentioning that the Underground Archive had many resources on religious rituals, so she got the other two arch librarians and took me down with Schwartz.</em>
</p><p>
<em>It was beautiful!</em>
</p><p>
<em>I only got to look for a little bit, but there were some ivory slates with information on rituals just like she said. One was for cooling down really hot weather. I’d be willing to bet that we could find something on Haldenzel. Do you think Sylvester would be willing to visit during the Interduchy Tournament? I’m sure if he presented the information on the stages, it would make the northern giebes view him in a much more positive light.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Of course, Charlotte is planning on coming now, too, since only royalty, archdukes, and archduke candidates registered to supply mana can enter. She thinks that given the restrictions, there’s probably a lot of information that would be useful to her as an aub.</em>
</p><p>
<em>That may be what she says, but I know she’s just been infected with my lust for books. She’s read every volume Mother has written, you know! Ehehehe, what a wonderful little sister I have!</em>
</p><p>
<em>–Rozemyne</em>
</p><p>Sylvester let the paper fall from between his fingers as he stared into nothingness. “She…she got the prince involved…with her class…and now…joint research…with Ahrensbach…”</p><p>“Don’t forget the archive that only archdukes and royalty can enter,” Karstedt sighed, pressing a hand against his face.</p><p>Ferdinand picked up the letter and scrutinized it again. It sounded like this was her first time seeing the archive, but was it? Had none of her time down there made it into her memories? He found that hard to believe, but she had only absorbed a portion of the mana in her feystone. She didn’t seem to have any positive memories of the other weave, so perhaps any time she spent surrounded by books hadn’t been included in what she recovered.</p><p>At least Adolphine, a member of royalty, was the one to introduce it to her. They may have been trying to lay a trap for her, but one afternoon with Rozemyne in that archive would prove she only cared about reading and nothing else. Regardless, they couldn’t cast suspicion on her now, and Raublut could no longer keep knowledge of the archive from the rest of the royal family now that Adolphine was a librarian.</p><p>Between Raublut and Georgine, how many plans did that make now that Ehrenfest had foiled? More than enough to make themselves their most important target. He would need to place an order for face masks for the Knight’s Order with the Gilberta Company and perhaps send them a sample of the silver cloth to study. Given how their enemies approached things in the previous weave, Ferdinand doubted they would think to have spies in the lower city.</p><p>Putting that aside, Ferdinand was less than thrilled with Hirschur’s response to Rozemyne, but he could understand it. Last weave, she would have had to contact Hildebrand, who was ill equipped to deal with such matters. This weave, not only was Anastasius the one representing the royal family this year, but he was already involved in the major political unrest between Ehrenfest and Ahrensbach, so not reporting this would be more suspicious than anything. It was better to at least give the appearance of transparency.</p><p>That, and this just added another mark in the tally against their enemies.</p><p>Sylvester set aside Rozemyne’s letter and picked up Roderick’s. They had gone to witness Dunkelfelger’s ditter rituals, and after seeing the one they performed before matches, Lestilaut insisted they try it for themselves. Wilfried, therefore, volunteered to be the center since he was taking the knight course and was more familiar with the dance than Rozemyne.</p><p>
<em>Lord Wilfried created a stir amongst the Dunkelfelger students who were watching when he produced Leidenschaft’s spear, sparkling blue with unshed power. When he began the song, everyone watched the tip of his spear as it swung in an almost hypnotic manner, its trailing blue light dragging the eye along with it. When it ended and he thrust his spear toward the sky, a great surge of mana burst forth and made an incredible blessing of multiple colors. A portion of blue light shot off from the circle, though no one knows where it went.</em>
</p><p>“What the hell?!” Sylvester gasped. “That’s so cool! Man, I wish I could have seen that! I bet he was grinning from ear to ear! You think we could get the apprentice knights to do it here when they get back?”</p><p>“Unlikely,” Ferdinand said, waving him off. “While they could perform the dance, it most likely will not accomplish anything. Sincere prayer is needed to create blessings, as Rozemyne will tell you. Demonstrating a pre-ditter ritual with no intent to play ditter afterwards probably won’t be interpreted as sincere by the gods.”</p><p>“Hmm… So if we get them to do it before they go out for speed ditter…”</p><p>Ferdinand paused. “That’s a possibility.” He wouldn’t mind seeing this ritual for himself. Perhaps they could have them perform it in lieu of Angriff’s blessing.</p><p>
<em>As impressive as the display was, our knights were unable to control their bodies as they simply had too much power from the blessing. Only Lord Wilfried seemed to have any real semblance of control, but even he had to be stopped by Matthias and Alexis when he went to attack the feybeast as the power in his blade was so great that he would endanger the spectators.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Dunkelfelger won, as was necessary for us to witness their post-win ritual. Lady Hannelore was quite the sight twirling her divine staff, evoking a most eerie sound. Mana began to almost evaporate from the Ehrenfest knights and drift in a beautiful swirl toward the sky as if returning to the gods what we borrowed.</em>
</p><p>
<em>According to our knights afterwards, their bodies had returned to normal, and even their emotions had calmed. Lady Hannelore and Lord Lestilaut professed that the rising mana phenomenon had never occurred before nor did the sound that Lady Rozemyne compared to the crashing waves of an ocean.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She must have read about how oceans sound. I find it truly amazing she would be able to recognize it from description alone.</em>
</p><p>
<em>This was apparently similar to a ritual Lady Rozemyne read about in the library that was meant to cool the intense heat of summer. She theorized that the ritual must have been meant to cool more than the weather based on the results of today’s research.</em>
</p><p>
<em>We must now prepare for Ehrenfest’s ritual. Lady Rozemyne says she will contact you for any needed assistance.</em>
</p><p>
<em>– Roderick</em>
</p><p>All three men looked at each other with grave expressions. It was possible Rozemyne would do things differently this time since she wasn’t so socially oblivious, but it was also possible her new social prowess and connections to royalty would drive the coming insanity to greater heights.</p><p>“Do you know what the ritual is going to be?” Sylvester asked.</p><p>Ferdinand tapped his temple as he thought through all the ones Rozemyne would know. “Most of the ones from the temple wouldn’t work as they revolve around events such as coming of age, starbinding, and traveling around the duchy for prayers and festivals. Haldenzel’s ritual requires a stage and magic circle. That really only leaves the Dedication Ritual.”</p><p>And summoning winter if she recalled it, but it would be pointless even if she did.</p><p>“What’s all needed for that?” Sylvester asked.</p><p>As Ferdinand began listing all the required items, he silently prayed that the royal family would not be involved this time.</p><p>Two days after that, they received an update from Ignaz, Wilfried’s scholar.</p><p>
<em>Aub Ehrenfest,</em>
</p><p><em>Today, Lord Wilfried and Lady Charlotte attended the tea party for cousins hosted by Ahrensbach. They brought the old editions of </em>Royal Academy Love Stories<em> and some newer flavors of pound cake. When Lady Detlinde asked after the Mont Blanc that was being spoken of all around the Academy, they both explained that the dessert was Lady Rozemyne’s original creation and therefore only available at tea parties she personally attended. This displeased her, but she quickly recovered.</em></p><p>
<em>During the tea party, Lady Detlinde focused almost entirely on Lord Wilfried, once again saying he should be thankful for her salvation. Once she started speaking ill of Lady Rozemyne, both Lord Wilfried and Lady Charlotte rose to her defense, which Lady Detlinde dismissed as the “cruelty of Aub Ehrenfest forcing his true children to bow to his strange, wicked schemes.”</em>
</p><p>“Just what rumors are they trying to spread about me now?” Sylvester hissed. “What schemes? Aren’t all my children ordained? Don’t they all participate in religious ceremonies? Barring Melchior, of course, who’s still learning to control his mana, but he’ll be High Bishop after Rozemyne comes of age! He can’t wait to go to the temple this spring!”</p><p>Ferdinand sighed. “Given the lack of reports stating similar opinions from other duchies, this is likely no more than a weak attempt on Detlinde’s part to elevate the reputation of her fiancé. Or at least <em>someone’s</em> part. I don’t know if she has the mental faculties to plan even something this simplistic.”</p><p>Karstedt nodded. “We’ve received no reports of other ill rumors. You said that even Professor Hirschur’s warnings were more to do with our rise in rank as a neutral duchy than anything personally dealing with you.”</p><p>“Yeah, I guess you’re right. Still, I don’t like being accused of mistreating any of my kids.”</p><p>
<em>Lady Detlinde then praised Lord Wilfried for starting all the joint research projects and stated she looked forward to working with him on the new project with Ahrensbach. He corrected her by saying Lady Rozemyne was the one conducting that research, and he had nothing to do with it as an archduke candidate taking the knight course. When she once again claimed he was being forced to give credit to a girl from the temple, he reminded her that Lady Rozemyne was her cousin, too. He was getting emotional at this point, but Lady Charlotte, try as she might, was unable to calm him down.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Lady Detlinde stated, “That temple girl is not my cousin.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Lord Wilfried replied, “That temple girl is my sister!” Moments after this, a darkness blessing shot from his ring and showered the room. Though not as extravagant as Lady Rozemyne’s blessings, it was still a startling sight.</em>
</p><p>Sylvester groaned. “This is the second time! We have two gremlins now!”</p><p>Rubbing his temples, Ferdinand said, “Send him a letter telling him to decompress his mana. He should be able to tell when he reaches the level his schtappe can handle.”</p><p>Wilfried’s response to the letter was…less than encouraging.</p><p>
<em>Father,</em>
</p><p>
<em>Thank you for the advice. However, until I know that I am well beyond the point where I could sense Lady Detlinde when my mana sensing develops, I will continue to compress. I don’t care how many blessings I accidentally shoot off. At least it won’t look so strange when Rozemyne next loses control. Maybe they’ll just think it’s an Ehrenfest thing.</em>
</p><p>
<em>–Wilfried.</em>
</p><p>“I…guess he’s fighting in his own way,” Sylvester said, his face pale.</p><p>“Let’s just pray this is the worst of it,” Ferdinand sighed. “Or at least that it doesn’t get much worse.”</p><p> </p><p>It seemed Mestionora was the one who had received his prayer because they soon got an urgent letter from Rozemyne.</p><p>
<em>To my fiancé,</em>
</p><p>
<em>Please understand that what I do, I do for the good of Ehrenfest. As you can see from the signatures at the end of this letter, my siblings agree this was the right course of action.</em>
</p><p>Sylvester cursed, but Ferdinand told him to remain calm until they found out what she’d done.</p><p>
<em>I had to go to Prince Anastasius to request the use of the Farthest Hall for the Dedication Ritual. He said they could open the hall, but we could not use the divine instruments because those would require permission from the Sovereign Temple, with whom the royal family is not on good terms. I offered to bring Ehrenfest’s tools, which he agreed to.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I mentioned that there were many students who had wanted to join our research and said that this would result in gathering quite a lot of mana. I asked his permission to offer it to the royal family who toils tirelessly for our country. While he obviously liked the idea, I could tell he was hesitant to accept.</em>
</p><p>Sylvester thumped his head on the desk. “Why?! Why is she still getting so unnecessarily involved with royalty?!”</p><p>“Wait,” Ferdinand said, holding up a hand. “This could work in our favor depending on how it’s handled. With this tactic, she’s making us useful to the royal family despite having been neutral during the civil war. It’s to our benefit if they view us favorably while they are investigating Ahrensbach who was allied to them.”</p><p>As Sylvester began to grumble into the surface of the wood, Karstedt ran a hand through his hair and said, “Even so, all this interaction with royalty…”</p><p>Ferdinand leveled a steady gaze at him. “We are the Seventh, not the Seventeenth. We are no longer in a position to act like a lower-middle-ranked duchy. Right now, we are no different from an archnoble bowing and scraping like the lowest of mednobles.”</p><p>Sylvester snapped his head up, his eyes wide. Had this man truly not realized the position they were in? “Yeah, you’re right. Royalty is already involved at this point. We might as well use it to our advantage. Besides, with all my kids being so awesome, the royals will start snatching them up if they see we’re not able to provide adequate support for such outstanding archduke candidates. The country isn’t so well off as to ignore exceptional but underutilized individuals like…” He trailed off, his eyes downcast.</p><p>Ferdinand looked away as well. Rozemyne would have only benefited from going to Dunkelfelger in the previous weave, and she might have realized that if she hadn't taken offense to Lestilaut insulting her craftspeople. Had she known unequivocally at the time that she would have been able to bring her family and all the books in the library Ferdinand had given her, he doubted they would have been able to keep her from flying straight from their base into Lestilaut’s arms. However, she hadn’t, and the love for her lower-city family had prevented her departure for as long as possible.</p><p>Ferdinand, on the other hand, had absolutely nothing tying him to Ehrenfest when he was in school. If the royal family had provided him an exit, he would have taken it without a second thought. There was no promise holding him back, and his most trusted retainers would have been able to come along with him with less risk of assassination than in either Ehrenfest or Ahrensbach. Indeed, with what was known about him at the time, he imagined that if the royal family were in the straits then that they were currently, he would have been taken from a bottom-ranking duchy without a second thought.</p><p>They now had three archduke candidates who had every element, could summon multiple divine instruments, excelled in their studies, made connections with top-ranking duchies, spread trends, and performed benevolent acts like protecting students from other duchies, and healing dozens of strangers. If Ehrenfest didn’t start to act according to its new station, they were going to lose at least one of their archduke candidates. Trying to use their lack of resources as an excuse would only justify the theft even more.</p><p>
<em>I then said that I would also make rejuvenation potions for all those who participated so that the mana they so generously gave would be replenished so that they may continue to support their duchies without issue.</em>
</p><p>
<em>The prince was so moved by this generosity that he actually lost his haughty expression long enough to say, “Rozemyne, you…”</em>
</p><p>
<em>He eventually said that he would be very appreciative, but he wanted to send his head scholar to watch me make them so no one could say they were poisoned. I told him I would have to get permission from you since it was his recipe. It’s the mana replenishing one.</em>
</p><p>Well, forget what he said about lack of resources. Any claim they made in that regard would be instantly dismissed now that Rozemyne would prove she could make dozens of rejuvenation potions when required.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, he said, “I don’t see where we have a choice at this point. If the royal family has a better recipe, then they won’t care to use it regardless. If not, then they desperately need it.” He would need to caution her, however. If they asked her why no one had told them about such an effective potion recipe, she would need to say that it was assumed the royal family’s own recipes would have been much better.</p><p>
<em>I informed him that we would not be able to bring chalices, but since I could make one, the royal family could either provide their own or use empty feystones to gather the mana. This came as no surprise since it's an open secret that the archduke candidates of Ehrenfest can make multiple divine instruments.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Please send the attached letter to Hartmut. We will need both him and all the items listed within to come to the Royal Academy one week from now. The Ehrenfest Dedication Ritual should be over by then.</em>
</p><p>
<em>— Rozemyne, Wilfried, Charlotte</em>
</p><p>Well, with any luck, they would have excess mana this time, too, and Rozemyne would ask them to pour it into the foundation. If not, Ferdinand would have to dump mana into it during the Interduchy Tournament to keep the garden from crumbling.</p><p>Sadly, he wasn’t present for Hartmut’s departure or the reports from the Academy’s Dedication Ritual as the Lord of Winter had arrived.</p>

<p>The strong blizzard winds buffeted the Knight’s Order as they approached the Lord of Winter. The monstrous feybeast rampaged through the Haldenzel forest, the snow flurries born from its power nearly obscuring its form. Ferdinand had been in Ahrensbach when this one attacked, and he found that he would much rather stand up to a hundred Lords of Winter than be forced back into the situation he had been in during the previous weave.</p><p>“Eckhart, Karstedt!” Ferdinand barked. “Take your squadrons and start attacking its legs! Cornelius! Take to the skies and prepare the strike team to attack on my signal!” The men bolted off to do as commanded, and he gave orders to the remaining med- and laynobles before climbing up far above the beast.</p><p>Lights flashed in the blizzard below him, and the beast roared, sending out more snow-born feybeasts. The med- and laynobles slaughtered them, but the mana simply returned to the monster, helping it to heal faster. For better or worse, there were too many eyes on him this time to use the God of Darkness’ cape.</p><p>He instead manifested his blade, filled it, and charged. After a handful of strikes, he yelled for the two squadrons to press the attack while he, Karstedt, and Eckhart flew up to meet the strike team. With a few hand motions, they were able to understand their next orders, and everyone charged their attacks, waiting for the signal. When the blades around Ferdinand flashed upon being filled, he thrust his hand forward and dived toward the rear leg. He, Karstedt, and Eckhart launched their attacks at the same time, the three meeting to sever its left hind leg. The strikes from Cornelius’ team hit the right leg a beat later, cutting it off and sending the feybeast tumbling to the ground.</p><p>Angelica suddenly appeared at its head as it fell, jabbing Stenluke into its eye socket and cutting out the valuable ingredient, disappearing again before it could recover enough to attack.</p><p>Meanwhile, the severed limbs melted into snow flurries and began reforming. By the time they were completely formed, Ferdinand’s and Cornelius’ teams were ready to attack once again, this time aiming for the front legs. Angelica harvested two of its teeth, receiving a cut on her leg that took her out of the fight until her potion could do its work.</p><p>After two more concentrated attacks, the two teams backed off to recover. They wouldn’t need long, and the fight was already almost over. They were about to enter the phase of attrition where the focus shifted entirely to harvesting rather than weakening. Once they were back in the fray, it only took three more rounds before they could start collecting claws, skin, flesh, bones, and organs. At that point, it was simply a game of waiting until nothing remained of the beast while ensuring no other threats came.</p><p>They returned to the castle two days later, worn and exhausted. The moment Norbert laid eyes on Ferdinand, he rushed forward and said, “The aub wishes to see you and Lord Karstedt immediately.”</p><p>The two men exchanged tired if worried looks and rushed to the office. Sylvester had it cleared within moments of their arrival, activated a sound-blocking tool, and shouted, “The <em>king</em> participated in the ritual!”</p><p>Karstedt looked as if his spirit had left his body while Ferdinand closed his eyes and took in a deep breath. “Explain.”</p><p>Sylvester rummaged through a drawer and thrust a sheaf of papers at him, which he took and read.</p><p>
<em>Father,</em>
</p><p>
<em>As we reported yesterday, the king himself deigned to join us for the Dedication Ritual. Along with him came Prince Sigiswald, his wife, Princess Eglantine, Princess Adolphine, and Prince Anastasius. Sister had already explained that no guard knights could be present, but the Sovereign Knight Commander still demanded that their order be allowed to enter. Sister, Brother, and I insisted that this could not happen, but we could prove that everyone inside the room held no malice with Schutzaria’s shield.</em>
</p><p>
<em>They thoroughly tested Sister’s shield, and not once did it falter. Even when someone tried to attack her from within, it ejected him before he could even swing his blade. She truly is amazing! To be able to hold the shield for so long! I can only imagine the amount of mana and mental strength she must contain.</em>
</p><p>
<em>When the king expressed his satisfaction with the shield, sister then asked permission to heal the knights who were injured. I offered to perform the healing as she had already expended so much mana, and she would need to recover before the ritual.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Once everyone was healed with Flutrane’s staff, the knight commander then cast doubt on our potions, even though Prince Anastasius’ own head scholar observed the entire brewing process from start to end, including the gathering. Brother, Sister, and all of our scholars capable of creating them worked tirelessly under his watchful gaze. The commander claimed, however, that we could have poisoned them when the scholar wasn’t looking or after he’d left.</em>
</p><p>
<em>One of the knights said that after seeing our actions at the Interduchy Tournament, receiving a superior potion recipe without so much as a thank you given in return, and being healed with a divine instrument at our own expense, he trusted us thoroughly and took one of the potions himself. He declared it safe and just as effective as before.</em>
</p><p>
<em>The knight commander was still not pleased, and the king had to order him to stand down.</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. Raublut was most certainly in Georgine’s clutches, then. At least they had built allies among the Sovereign Knight’s Order and perhaps the royal family as well. Since they were aware of trug, it was much less likely they would fall for the same schemes</p><p>
<em>The royal family stood in a line beyond the entrance so they could be easily greeted by the students who were participating. There were several who could not enter, mostly from losing duchies, but four of the six from Ahrensbach were repelled by the shield as well. Prince Anastasius took particular note of this and said something to the king, though I couldn’t hear what.</em>
</p><p>“And so their suspicion against our enemies grows,” Ferdinand said, a dark smile spreading across his face.</p><p>“<em>That’s</em> your take away?” Sylvester asked.</p><p>“Silence. I haven’t finished reading.”</p><p>
<em>Before we began, Sister explained the ritual and that they would likely see a pillar of light, which seemed to be something that only occurred during rituals performed at the Royal Academy. Though she was uncertain why, she said her current theory was that the Royal Academy was closer to the gods. To nearly everyone’s amazement, she then produced Geduldh’s chalice, and Hartmut helped her place it at the front.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She then went to the back of the hall while Hartmut had everyone arrange themselves. Brother and I took the lead in showing them the proper kneeling stance, and then Sister was beckoned to enter.</em>
</p><p>
<em>The ritual was one of the most beautiful moments I’ve ever experienced. I had felt the unity before when performing it at the temple, but feeling at one with so many others was beyond description. It was truly like touching the divine. I wonder if this is what Sister experiences on a regular basis? I believe she is closer to the divine than anyone alive, a true incarnation of a goddess.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I must confess, I almost let myself get carried away. My job was to let Sister know when to stop, and I’m afraid I was a bit later than I was supposed to be. Many of the archnobles and some of the archduke candidates collapsed, and even the royal family looked tired. We distributed the potions, and some started to protest, but they were instantly silenced when the king drank his without hesitation. Brother offered healing that allowed everyone to at least get on their knees while they waited for the potions to help them recover.</em>
</p><p>
<em>The king then stood and thanked everyone who participated. It was such a touching moment watching everyone’s joy light the room. While they were distracted, I noticed Sister pour more of her mana into the chalice. She must have been overfilled after taking the recovery potion earlier.</em>
</p><p>
<em>After the king and first prince left, the students began filing out, and Prince Anastasius, Professor Eglantine, and Professor Adolphine brought many empty feystones to be filled, but even then, there was still mana left. Sister suggested they donate it to the library as they only recently obtained their third arch library, and Professor Adolphine agreed wholeheartedly.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Matthias and Laurenz carried the chalice as Sister left with the rest of the royal family to see to distributing the mana while Brother remained behind to see to the cleanup, and I spoke with the Dunkelfelger archduke candidates and their scholars about the ritual.</em>
</p><p>
<em>When Sister returned, Prince Anastasius came with her and inspected the Farthest Hall to ensure everything was in order before closing the door. He then graciously thanked us on behalf of the royal family, and for a moment, his eyes were filled with emotion. He then told Sister that if Uncle created the recipe for the potion she’d shared with them, then he was formidable indeed.</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand snorted. <em>And he’d better not forget it.</em></p><p>The last few lines of the letter were Charlotte’s impressions of everyone’s reactions, all mostly positive or awestruck, save for the students from losing duchies who claimed they held no malice and the Ahrensbach archnobles who cried that Rozemyne was personally conspiring against them. Considering how suspicious they already looked, all that would do was declare who their target was. If anything at all happened to Rozemyne, the royal family would know where to start looking.</p><p>While that was somewhat comforting, it was more concerning than anything. Raublut would not have failed to notice his allies dragging themselves through the mud. He would either have to remove himself from the filth or set fire to everything before his guilt was discovered. Would they be able to speed up the invasion? Georgine still didn’t have the key, but she knew how to get it. It was possible she would simply brute force her way through since all of her careful plans had come to naught.</p><p>In the meantime, he consoled his brother by confirming nothing truly negative against them had occurred and reminded him to start acting like the archduke of a high-ranking duchy.</p><p> </p><p>Clear weather graced them the following days, so Ferdinand summoned the Gilberta and Plantin Companies to the temple five days after the Lord of Winter hunt. When they arrived, he started by giving Tuuli another hairpin order for Rozemyne, this one in summer colors. He let Otto know to expect a summons from the castle soon since Elvira and Florencia were working on Rozemyne’s next few dress orders.</p><p>He then handed over a scrap of the silver cloth. “Have you ever seen anything like this?” he asked.</p><p>Otto gave it a close inspection, staring at the fibers and weave, rubbing it between his fingers, and even sniffing it. He then passed it to Tuuli who similarly looked it over then shook her head. “It’s well made,” Otto said, “but I don’t recognize the fiber or the dye.”</p><p>“Forgive me for saying so,” Tuuli interjected, “but this does not look to be dyed at all. I believe the silver color comes from the thread itself. It is strangely cool to the touch despite the warmth in the room. It’s almost as if it were fabric made of metal.”</p><p>Ferdinand narrowed his eyes. Lanzenave had used silver weapons as well. Had they found a way to spin that metal into thread? It had no mana, so it wasn’t like the mana threads he would make in brewing. “Could one turn metal into thread?” he asked.</p><p>Otto, Tuuli, and Benno exchanged a look. “I would say it was impossible,” Otto ventured, “but I would have said the same of many of the products Ehrenfest is now known for. With your permission, I would like to take this sample to some of the metal craftsmen we work with to get their thoughts. If it is indeed made of metal, perhaps they can at least identify what kind.”</p><p>“Yes, that will be fine. Now, I would like to place an order for masks.” He had Janrik hand over the designs. “I need at least 300 as soon as possible.”</p><p>All the merchants’ eyes bugged, and it took several moments for them to get their expressions back under control. “A-as soon as possible, you say?” Otto asked, his face draining of color.</p><p>“I understand this is an exceedingly large order,” Ferdinand said. “You may distribute the order to other clothing shops as you see fit so long as they are trustworthy. I do not want word of this spreading too far. Understand?”</p><p>“Y-yes, my lord.”</p><p>He frowned and tapped his temple, hearing Rozemyne fussing at him in the back of his mind. “When I say ‘as soon as possible,’ I do not mean that in the way nobles typically do. I mean it literally - as soon as you<em> possibly</em> can. These need to be well-made. I would rather you prioritize quality over speed. However, they are meant for utility, not fashion. I will have them embroidered by nobles. You merely need to provide them in their basic form. Deliver them in batches as they are made rather than all at once.”</p><p>Some of the color returned to Otto’s face. “Yes, my lord.”</p><p>“Now, Benno,” Ferdinand said, turning his attention to him, “due to circumstances, I was forced to give up a significant portion of my nanseb and effon paper. I would like to place orders for what I have lost along with another for trombe paper.” As Mark noted that down, Ferdinand asked, “How is training the craftsmen from Dunkelfelger and Drewanchel coming along?”</p><p>Benno nodded. “They are all quite talented, as one would expect of the best sent from greater duchies. The wood craftsmen will be ready to depart in spring, and I will have to get the paper guilds established in both duchies as soon as they leave. The metal craftsmen, however, will require another season at least before they’re able to consistently produce metal types up to standard. We can expect more paper to enter the market almost immediately, but it will be some time before we see any new printed materials from other duchies. I imagine within the next five years, however, they will be able to outstrip us given their population and resources.”</p><p>Tapping his temple, Ferdinand said, “I do not foresee that being a financial loss for us, however, given the patent and copyright systems Rozemyne put in place.”</p><p>Benno’s grin turned predatory. “That is entirely correct, my lord.”</p><p>“Very well,” he said. “Continue the good work. I imagine we’ll have more craftsmen from other duchies next year as well. We may delay your departure until after the Archduke Conference so that you can establish paper-making and printing guilds in both our current and future partners’ duchies at the same time. The fewer times Rozemyne leaves our borders, the better.”</p><p>“Yes, my lord.”</p><p>After they left, Ferdinand spoke with Hartmut about how matters in the temple were progressing, listened to his version of events on the Dedication Ritual - which matched Charlotte’s but with more fanaticism - and received an update on the temple school. Several lay- and poorer mednoble children were slated to start attending in the spring once the winter playroom came to an end. However, underaged noble children were currently receiving an education while their parents socialized. This was acting in part as a “proof of concept” for the school and in part to keep Ehrenfest’s edge in grades now that their picture books and karuta were being distributed across Yurgenschmidt.</p><p>Rozemyne had argued that if the entire duchy’s grades were considered in rankings,then it only made sense to do everything they could to raise the grades of the traditionally lowest performers - the laynobles. “I’m already first in class,” she’d said. “I can’t score any higher to bring up the average any more. This is the only option left if you want us to keep doing better.”</p><p>In truth, many of the Leisegang nobles <em>didn’t</em> want the rankings to improve. They simply could not fathom how to act like an upper-ranked duchy. Sylvester, however, was having none of their complaining. In fact, the aub was half ready to start forcing the inflexible giebes into retirement in favor of their more open-minded successors, some of whom had seen the difference the archduke candidates had made in the winter playroom or Royal Academy. Only time would tell if the giebes would realize they didn’t have a quarter of the power they thought they had over the aub before it was too late.</p><p>A week passed, and some of Ferdinand’s paper was delivered. Janrik was able to receive it at the estate and sort it to be put away in the workshop at a later date. It would still be some time before they were able to get the entire trombe paper order, but Ferdinand wasn’t quite desperate for it yet. They still had time.</p><p>Reports from the Royal Academy were interesting but not concerning. Those working with Dunkelfelger were compiling reports using questionnaires and then putting the data into graphs. Drewanchel was less disappointed with Ehrefest’s scholars than the past weave with both Charlotte and Rozemyne helping to come up with ideas for them to research or methods to try to improve the paper. Ahrensbach was proceeding much smoother than the previous weave as well. Ferdinand could only assume Rozemyne had recovered memories of what they’d done in the previous weave because they blew through the sound-recording magic tool and made great strides in creating a handful of others. It did help, of course, that they had a more direct line of contact with Ferdinand, so he was better poised to help guide them. It brought him no end of satisfaction that he was able to help them while indulging in some research himself without having to live vicariously through his two disciples.</p><p>He had just finished penning a response to Raimund when another report came in. As Sylvester opened it, Ferdinand set aside the wooden board to dry and then nearly jumped out of his skin when Sylvester leapt to his feet and bellowed, “WHAT THE FUCK?!”</p><p>“Sylvester!” Karstedt and Ferdinand admonished at the same time.</p><p>“Don’t ‘Sylvester’ me!” he yelled, throwing the paper at Ferdinand.</p><p>He caught it and after skimming the first line written in Charlotte’s hand, he nearly shouted the exact same phrase.</p><p>
<em>Father,</em>

<p>“Ferdinand!!”</p><p>I woke up screaming, my hand reaching out to a phantom from my mind. Ferdinand had been grasping his chest, pain distorting his beautiful features. He’d fallen. Detlinde had mocked him. She’d placed schtappe-sealing cuffs on his wrists, put his hand on the circle to fill the foundation, and left him to die.</p><p>The entire time, I screamed. I reached out. I tried to stop her, tried to move Ferdinand’s hand, tried to let him know I was coming… It was just as ineffectual as my hand reaching into the darkness now.</p><p>I sat up, cold sweat on my brow, reaching up to feel my face and body. I confirmed that I wasn’t a weak little child, but that didn’t tell me where or when I was.</p><p>Rihyarda threw open the curtains and pressed a feystone to my forehead. This had become a routine as of late for her, though I couldn’t recall if it had been one before as well or just now.</p><p>“Rihyarda,” I asked, “how old am I?”</p><p>“You’re twelve, my lady. You’re in your third year at the Royal Academy.”</p><p>“Who am I engaged to?”</p><p>“Lord Ferdinand.”</p><p>“Where is he?”</p><p>“Ehrenfest, my lady.”</p><p>She then held out her hand, and I took the pendant from her, running my fingers over the feystone and feeling the warm, familiar mana within. Ferdinand’s crest appeared, and I sighed with relief. He was alive. He was still alive. That woman hadn’t harmed him.</p><p>“Wilfried,” I grimaced. “I can’t let him suffer like Ferdinand.”</p><p>Rihyarda sighed and stroked my hair. “Everything will be fine.”</p><p>Such pretty, empty words. It wasn’t fine. It wouldn’t be fine until my entire family was safe. She didn’t understand. She hadn’t seen what Detlinde was capable of. I’d already witnessed her killing my fiancé countless times. I wouldn’t watch her kill my brother as well.</p><p>After dressing, I went downstairs and ate breakfast with my brother and sister, discussing our plans for the day. We were going to take everyone out to the gathering spot, have them get all the ingredients they could, then replenish it as many times as we could manage. Thanks to Wilfried’s letter, I was able to dump a lot of mana after the divine protection ritual, but quite a bit had returned since then. Wilfried also needed to dump some, whether he realized it or not. He was a lot more religious this weave, so he wasn’t immune from dropping blessing bombs himself.</p><p>After refilling the gathering spot three times, we returned to the dorm, and Charlotte and I gave our brother last-minute advice. Then, we went to music class.</p><p>I went ahead and played so that I could go sit with Hannelore and focus completely on my objective. We talked casually while she and the other two girls in the group practiced. When I felt their focus shift from the instruments to the conversation, I gave a signal to Wilfried.</p><p>When he sat at the front, I said, “Oh, it looks like my brother is about to play.”</p><p>Hannelore smiled. “Will he be playing an original song from Ehrenfest?”</p><p>I gave her a mischievous grin and then turned my attention to Wilfried, watching my dear friend from the corner of my eye.</p><p>He played the required song without issue. Then, he started to sing one of the more recent love songs I’d written from the God of Darkness’ perspective, of how he was wandering alone, his shadow reaching in the dark to cross with another’s, but his heart was hidden in the ever-present night. When the Goddess of Light appeared, he couldn’t contain his joy that the shadow of his cloak was no longer empty of anything but his loneliness. Even though they had to spend so much time apart, he waited impatiently for the brief moments of time they could meet once again.</p><p>Just as Charlotte, Brunhilde, and I directed him, he looked up and met Hannelore’s gaze for just a moment before shyly glancing away again as he played the last few notes. He didn’t even have to fake it; he’d blushed just from us suggesting it to him. Even now, his cheeks were rosy.</p><p>My precious, precious Hannelore, who had already described him as “wonderful” after I made sure she was close enough to hear about his divine protections, became flustered. Her friends started to giggle, and when one of them made a suggestive comment, Hannelore responded, “Stop. He’s already engaged to Lady Detlinde, right, Rozemyne?”</p><p>I put a troubled hand on my cheek and looked away. “It’s truly a shame love matches are so rare in Yurgenschmidt, is it not?”</p><p>The girls gasped and looked at Wilfried, who received his passing marks before going back to sit with Ortwin and some of the other boys. His friends teased him a bit, but he just shrugged it off. He knew what was at stake, and a little good-natured ribbing wasn’t going to deter him.</p><p>Of course, not all of our plans could go so smoothly. During whirling class, I wanted to get Wilfried and Hannelore to talk a bit, but then the snake appeared. Just seeing her was enough to make my brother emotional, but he tried to reign it in. He even started muttering a prayer under his breath.</p><p>Of course, Detlinde was completely oblivious, lost in her little world of false superiority as she belittled my brother to make herself look better, just like she’d done to Ferdinand.</p><p>
<em>Just like she’d done to Ferdinand.</em>
</p><p>I had to close my eyes to stop myself from Crushing her.</p><p>A startled gasp made me open them again, and above us was a dark blessing.</p><p>“Oh my!” Detlinde cooed in her insipid voice. “A blessing from my future God of Darkness!”</p><p>
<em>Uh, no, that was definitely from Verdraeos. He’s saying you're a Chaocipher that he needs to get away from, but I’d guess you’d need half a brain cell to figure that out.</em>
</p><p>I made sure to whisper an apology to Lady Hannelore in case Wilfried startled her with his “prayer to the God of Deliverance.” She, of course, understood exactly what that meant, and she gave a pitying look to my brother.</p><p>It soon turned angry, however, when Detlinde invited Wilfried and Charlotte to a tea party for cousins, tacking on, “Oh, but don’t be mistaken. This is for my <em>true</em> cousins, so Lady Rozemyne, I must ask you to excuse yourself once again.”</p><p>Not like I wanted to go, anyway, but at least she made herself look even worse. That would make Hannelore much more motivated to save my brother.</p><p>During the archduke candidate class, Wilfried carried my feystones and gold dust for me and set them on my desk, right next to Hannelore.</p><p>“Oh! Lord Wilfried!” she gasped. “Did you carry Lady Rozemyne’s things for her?”</p><p>He nodded. “Of course. What kind of brother would I be otherwise? How are you today, Lady Hannelore?”</p><p>Blushing, she looked away and muttered, “Lestilaut would never…” Then, she looked back up and said, “I’m doing well. My brother says you’ve been doing splendidly in your knight course.”</p><p>“Ah, he’s exaggerating,” Wilfried said with an embarrassed chuckle. Ortwin called out then, so he excused himself and went to talk with his friend.</p><p>Hannelore giggled and whispered, “Lady Rozemyne, you have such a wonderful brother.”</p><p>“Yeah, he’s the best,” I said with a smile. “Oh, but don’t tell my other brothers I said that!”</p><p>We both giggled, and then I changed the subject and brought up the joint research. We agreed to have a tea party with the archduke candidates from both Ehrenfest and Dunkelfelger to go over details before we talked to our aubs.</p><p>Professor Eglantine came in then, and I stiffened for just a moment before forcing myself to relax. It was time to make my mock city, so I got to work. When the professor came over to see what I was working on, she tilted her head to the side and asked, “Do you plan to turn your whole city into a library?”</p><p>“And a workshop!” I corrected. I wanted to make Ferdinand happy, and I also wanted him to be near me, so what better way than to put his workshop right next to my library so we could always see each other?</p><p>“As expected of one so blessed by Mestionora.”</p><p>A shiver ran up my spine as I looked up to see Eglantine’s shining eyes. Would she force me to be her personal Mestionora in this weave, too? Would she make me do the shrine tour and sell me off to the first prince while holding the person I loved hostage?</p><p>Thankfully, my mother was allowed to raise me this time, so I was able to hide all these feelings behind a polite smile.</p><p> </p><p>Our tea party with Dunkelfelger went well. We brought them an advance copy of <em>A Ditter Story</em> and asked for their opinions, which nearly the entire dorm agreed to provide. Once again, Lestilaut lamented the lack of illustrations unlike in the Dunkelfelger history book or the romance novel I was lending Hannelore. I apologized, saying that my artist was a commoner and that I did not know a noble capable of providing illustrations.</p><p>On cue, Hannelore volunteered her brother, who was itching to offer his services but too proud to do so on his own. I let Wilfried and Lestilaut hype themselves up over which scenes would be best to illustrate, and then I mentioned that I would only buy five per volume.</p><p>“Oh, that’s right,” I said, placing a hand on my cheek. “You’re graduating this year, aren’t you? You won’t be able to provide the illustrations for the rest of the volumes, then. I can’t simply invite you to Ehrenfest since you’re an archduke candidate.”</p><p>“But, Rozemyne…” Wilfried said, looking pitiful.</p><p>I shook my head. “Well, maybe we can work something out. I would not mind considering your artwork for this volume, at least, if you are okay with that.”</p><p>Hannelore looked nervously at her brother, but he quickly started getting pumped back up as he and Wilfried started talking about which scenes to illustrate again.</p><p> </p><p>On the day of the cousins-only tea party, I went to Professor Hirschur’s lab to work on my research project with Raimund. It was actually pretty exciting because I didn’t remember anything about it, only that I did it. We were looking at making magic tools for my library, but first Raimund was tasked with making a voice recording tool as small as possible. My part was easy. All I had to do was brew. He came up with all the ideas.</p><p>Lieseleta and Brunhilde cleaned the lab then served a late lunch for Professor Hirschur and Raimund while I wrote up a report to give to Fraularm to appease her. She was annoying, but I needed her for the time being. I couldn’t continue to pass the scholar course in the coming years without her.</p><p>Once that was finished, I got to work on brewing Raimund’s latest design. As I stirred, I had vague recollections of struggling to finish stirring a concoction, but I couldn’t remember if that was this weave or last or maybe both. After a while, the surface flashed, and something metallic knocked around the bottom of the pot. I reached in and pulled out the device.</p><p>“Raimund, does this look right?” I asked, passing it to him.</p><p>He tested it out and nodded. “Yeah, I think this will do.”</p><p>“Oh, what if we put it inside a stuffed doll? You could touch its chest, and it would speak to you!”</p><p>Lieseleta suddenly stepped forward. “Yes, a shumil would be perfect! I will make one.”</p><p>A wave of sad nostalgia washed over me so hard that my knees trembled.</p><p>
<em>Ferdinand, this is really hard for me.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Ferdinand, please tell me I worked hard today.</em>
</p><p>The excitement I felt recording these words.</p><p>The sadness I felt wishing I could say them myself.</p><p>Recording them on what? For who? When?</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne?”</p><p>I looked up and saw Brunhilde staring at me, her eyes wide with worry.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I put on the smile I was taught to use like armor and said, “Yes, Brunhilde?”</p><p>“...It’s nothing.”</p><p>With a nod, I turned to look at Raimund and asked, “While we wait for Ferdinand’s approval, do you have plans for the next schematic already?”</p><p>“The odor-blocking tool?” he asked.</p><p>“Yes,” I said. “I think you could make quite a bit of money off of those schematics. Think of all the scholars who would buy them! If not them, then the people who live close to scholars.”</p><p>Professor Hirschur nodded. “I agree that it will be a popular tool, and I quite appreciate this patent system you’ve developed. Now that Dunkelfelger and Drewanchel have both adopted it for the printing industry, we should have little problem getting others to follow it. I do wonder, though, Lady Rozemyne - what inspired this tool? Libraries are not normally known for their offensive odors.”</p><p>“Isn’t it obvious?” I asked. “I’m marrying a mad scientist, after all. Ferdinand’s workshop will of course be close to my library, but it would be tragic to have my reading time interrupted by a noxious experiment of his.”</p><p>Hirschur raised a brow. “I see. Raimund?”</p><p>He shook his head. “My apologies, Lady Rozemyne, but the plans are not quite ready yet.”</p><p>“That’s fine,” I said. “I’ll come back in a few days then. You can send me an ordonnanz if it’s ready sooner. In the meantime, do you want me to send the sound recorder to him to review?”</p><p>“Yes, please, if you wouldn’t mind.”</p><p>Brunhilde and Lieseleta packed up our things, and we returned to the dorm. After I sent Gretia off with the report for Fraularm, I started writing one for Ferdinand detailing the experiment and asking for his approval on the tool.</p><p>The dormitory door burst open, and Wilfried stomped in, his face flushed with anger. Charlotte was following along after, worry clear on her face.</p><p>“Brunhilde, Rihyarda, ready a meeting room.”</p><p>I immediately went to Wilfried’s side and grabbed his hand. “Hey, let’s go talk. Come on, Charlotte.”</p><p>We approached the meeting room door, just as my attendants finished, and the three of us stepped inside and closed the door, leaving all of our retainers outside. Charlotte quickly turned on the sound-blocking tool as Wilfried collapsed in a chair, his head in his hands as his shoulders shook with rage or grief.</p><p>“What happened?” I asked.</p><p>Charlotte shot a concerned look at our brother before she answered, “Lady Detlinde was rather…abrasive today, and Brother ended up giving another blessing.”</p><p>“Verdraeos again?” I asked.</p><p>Wilfried looked up at us, tears in his eyes. “Charlotte, your plan better work.” Then, he dropped his gaze back to the floor and muttered, “I’d rather die than marry her.”</p><p>A chill ran up my spine. He didn’t realize how likely that was to happen. “Hey, Wilfried,” I said, “we should do something about these blessings.”</p><p>“What?” he asked. “Like never see that girl again? I can’t, Rozemyne! It wasn’t enough that the king decided to make me marry her! Now, I have to talk to her to see if I can get any information out of her! If they know she’s our enemy, why haven’t they canceled the engagement?!”</p><p>I put my hand on his shoulder and leaned down so that we were at eye level. “Wilfried, it’ll be okay. You know Charlotte’s plan will work. In the meantime, though, I’m having problems controlling my mana, too, after the divine protection ritual, so will you come with me? I would rather not go alone…”</p><p>Unlike the Wilfried in some of my memories, my big brother was reliable. He immediately agreed to accompany me. The only trick was to figure out how to slip away from our huge retinues.</p><p>“Hmm… First, let’s go to the gathering spot. Bring only the minimum number of guard knights. Charlotte, you stay here. Work with the scholars to keep brewing tools.”</p><p>“Right!”</p><p>I gave Wilfried Heilschmerz’s blessing to heal his reddened eyes, and we stepped outside the room. “Alright,” I said, “Wilfried and I are going to go gather a few materials we need. Matthias, Laurenz, and Judithe, you’re with me.”</p><p>My brother nodded and called over Gregor and Alexis. “Right,” he said. “That should be all we need.”</p><p>“My lord,” Leopold said just as Rihyarda was starting to object. “That’s not enough guards. You should take at least three more.”</p><p>With a sigh of frustration, Wilfried said, “Maybe, but no one else is here right now, are they? We’ll be fine. I’m a knight, too, you know.”</p><p>We rushed out the door, our guard knights calling out to us as we used enhancement magic to outrun any more objections. Wilfried was able to form his highbeast and jump on it mid-stride. I was not so fortunate with my drivable highbeast, so he yanked me up onto his, and we blasted towards the gathering spot. I had to ride side-saddle, of course, because I wasn’t in my riding clothes, but at least my feystone armor could still cover me and keep me warm.</p><p>As we flew to the gathering spot, I laughed and said, “Ferdinand will kill you if he finds out about this.”</p><p>“Why?” he asked. “You can ride highbeasts with your family.”</p><p>I decided to leave it at that.</p><p>We landed at the gathering spot and got to work getting ingredients for rejuvenation potions. We were going to need a lot of them, anyway. I waited for a bit before I said, “Hey, Wilfried, did you know Grandfather destroyed a shrine at the Academy?”</p><p>“He did what?!” Wilfried asked. “Did they fix it?!”</p><p>I shrugged. “Brother Eckhart said they did. Want to go check it out?”</p><p>“Do you know where it is?”</p><p>“I think so. Want to ride with me this time?”</p><p>Wilfried got a look on his face then sighed in defeat. “Yeah, sure. Gregor, come on.”</p><p>“What? Me?” his guard knight asked.</p><p>I ignored them and made my pandabus, beckoning Judithe over to sit in the passenger seat. My objective was simple - have fewer highbeasts to attract as little attention as possible.</p><p>We landed at the shrine to Schutzaria, and I passed Wilfried a sound-blocking tool. “Hey, Wilfried, you have potions on you, yes?”</p><p>“Yeah, why?”</p><p>“Because you may need them. You’re going to touch the door to the shrine. Then, you’ll be inside. When you come back out, no time will have passed. You need to act like nothing happened, alright?”</p><p>“Huh? What are you talking about?”</p><p>I shot him a look. “Just trust me, okay? This is going to help us both control our mana. If you still have questions when we’re done, then we can talk in a meeting room when we get back.”</p><p>“Um… Right.”</p><p>We approached the shrine, and I looked around. “Seems like they fixed it,” I said. “Unless it’s the wrong one. I heard there are a lot of shrines at the Academy.”</p><p>Wilfried nodded stiffly, walked up to the door, and placed his hand on it. A second later, he pulled his hand back and blinked. I looked down at his belt and noticed one of his potions was gone.</p><p>“Rozemyne…”</p><p>“You want to go see if it was a different one, maybe?” I asked, trying to communicate with him telepathically.</p><p>Thankfully, Ordoschnelli decided to throw me a bone because my dense but lovable big brother nodded. We got back in my pandabus and went to the next shrine - the darkness shrine. We both put our hands on it at the same time, but when I went inside, I didn’t see Wilfried. The feystone was nearly full, though, so I didn’t have to give much mana at all to get the tablet. When I came out, Wilfried looked fine, if a bit scared, but he hadn’t taken any more of his potions, so he probably didn’t have to give much mana, either.</p><p>The fire shrine’s feystone only had a little mana, so I had to give quite a lot before I got the tablet. That was one kindness-infused potion down. Wilfried, once again, had no issues and took no potions. I recalled then that the light that had shot off from the ditter ritual was blue and wondered if it had come to the shrine to wait for him. That would explain the lights when I got the Supreme Couple’s names and why I didn’t have to give much to get the darkness tablet.</p><p>When we got to the water shrine, Alexis asked, “Are we still going to keep looking for this shrine? I think it’s safe to say that it’s been repaired at this point. Lord Bonifatius was here a long time ago, after all.”</p><p>Wilfried waved him off. “Yeah, I want to keep looking.” We both placed our hands on the door, and when I went inside, the tablet was already formed.</p><p>“Ah, the healing rituals,” I said as I picked up the tablet and felt it merge with my schtappe. I was at the point where I could safely start compressing again, but I wanted to keep going.</p><p>I mean, come on! There was a book at the end of this rainbow road of tablets! How could I stop now when there were only two (or three) shrines left?</p><p>Once again, Wilfried hadn’t taken a potion, but he didn’t look any worse for wear. My vague memories of my forced death march around the shrines suggested that I was in a similar position to him back then, but I was pretty sure I was the only one doing the rituals then.</p><p>Comparing my brother then and now made me wonder if the memories were completely false or not. Surely a person couldn’t change that much, could they?</p><p>The light shrine required a little mana, probably the same as Wilfried since he also ended up using potions when he got the Supreme Couple’s names. As I readied myself to go to the God of Life and Earth’s shrine, I paused. If I got the remaining tablets now, then the next time I went to the Underground Archive, Schwartz and Weiss would take me to the forbidden archive that I couldn’t enter. I remembered beating against the barrier I couldn’t pass until I became bloody, screaming in agony because without the book, Ferdinand would die, but I couldn’t remember why his life was hanging in the balance.</p><p>It was my only memory of the Underground Archive from the previous weave, but I trusted it completely. If I got those tablets, I wouldn’t be able to go down there, and it would look suspicious to anyone who knew me if I started avoiding an entire archive.</p><p>Also, I didn’t want to avoid it. There were so many interesting things to read that I only had access to as a supplier of a foundation!</p><p>Wilfried would be in the same position if I took him to the last shrine, too. While he may never set foot in the library again, I couldn’t say that he wouldn't definitively, especially since he came with us last year when Sylvester escorted me to drop off the feystones. If either of us was outed at this juncture, I didn’t know what would happen to us, but I knew it wouldn’t be good.</p><p>“That’s the last one I know of,” I sighed as I withdrew my pandabus, bringing the tour to an early close. “I guess Alexis was right. Maybe I can ask Brother Eckhart when we return which one it was. I really couldn’t tell at all, could you?”</p><p>Wilfried shook his head, choosing to remain silent.</p><p>I looked to my guards and said, “Don’t speak a word of this to anyone.” Matthias and Laurenz stiffened as my mana bound them, and they nodded. “I…don’t want to get yelled at.”</p><p>Coming out of his stupor, Wilfried told his two guard knights the same. “Uncle would definitely murder me for letting Rozemyne go around the Academy with so few guard knights. Sorry, Alexis, Gregor. I just got too curious.”</p><p>When we returned to the dorm, he got Leopold to prepare a meeting room and pulled me in, closing the door behind.</p><p>“Lord Wilfried!” Leopold called from the other side. “It’s improper for two engaged people to be alone in a room together.”</p><p>Wilfried yanked the door open. “Are you being serious right now? She’s my sister!”</p><p>“A sister with whom you do not share a mother,” he said.</p><p>“Fine. Charlotte! Come here!”</p><p>She wandered in, looking concerned, but reassured Leopold and Rihyarda before she closed the door.</p><p>I quickly activated the sound-blocking tool and sat down while Wilfried paced back and forth, his hand in his hair. As I waited for him to formulate his thoughts, Charlotte tugged on my sleeve. “Sister, what happened when you went gathering?”</p><p>Wilfried spun around and plopped down in a chair. “What happened was that Rozemyne and I just became Zent candidates.”</p><p>“What?!” Charlotte gasped.</p><p>I sighed. “It was the only way to increase the quality of our schtappes so that we wouldn’t lose control of our mana. We can compress basically as much as we want now.”</p><p>“Well, there’s that at least,” Wilfried sighed.</p><p>“Don’t worry,” I told Charlotte. “You’ll probably need to become a candidate next year, too, after you do your divine protection ritual.”</p><p>“That seems like plenty of reason to worry!” she cried. “Sister, Brother, what are you saying?! Zent candidates?! Are… Are we about to be labeled traitors?! You’re not trying to take the throne, are you?!”</p><p>“No!” Wilfried yelled.</p><p>“Of course not!” I said. “I just wanted us to have control of our mana. It’s not our fault they made us get our schtappes so early.”</p><p>“We should tell the prince,” Wilfried said. “They’re looking for the Grutrisshiet, right?”</p><p>I shook my head. “No, they can’t get it.”</p><p>Both of my siblings gaped at me.</p><p>With a shrug, I explained, “You remember at the divine protection ritual that the statues moved, and the stairway took you up to the tree where we got our schtappes?”</p><p>“Yeah. What about it?”</p><p>“Well, they used to get their schtappes right after the ritual, right?” I asked. “So that means if you got protection from all the gods, you could then get your schtappe from the tree right after. Didn’t you think at the time, ‘Man, if I had gotten my schtappe now, I wouldn’t have had to walk so far’?”</p><p>That brought him up short. “Actually, yeah, now that you mention it, that was a pretty far walk. So you’re saying you would have had to get your schtappe from the tree in order to get the Book of Mestionora?”</p><p>“That’s exactly what I’m saying.”</p><p>“Why don’t you think the royal fami– Oh. You think they’re missing some of the pillar god protections?”</p><p>Charlotte sighed and leaned back against her chair, looking just like Florencia whenever I said something exasperating during ladies’ education. “It’s exceedingly rare for someone to have all seven colors, isn’t it? Wilfried and I weren’t born with them, but we still obtained them through prayer, right? Is it possible for the…” She trailed off as her eyes widened. “You have to get the schtappe after you get the colors because you can only get the schtappe from the tree if you already have the colors. There’s no way for the royal family to get the Book of Mestionora unless they already have all seven colors.”</p><p>I nodded. “The youngest prince might have a chance, and since we just introduced religious rituals to the royal family, maybe he’ll start praying sincerely. There are a lot of people backing him as the next Zent since his mother is from Dunkelfelger. Either way, Wilfried and I can’t get the book even if we wanted to.”</p><p>Wilfried sighed. “Yeah, we didn’t get two of the seven tablets. You don’t know where the last shrine is, right?”</p><p>With a shrug, I said, “It doesn’t matter if I do or don’t. I’m not going anywhere near it.” Not until I was ready to graduate or another Zent was crowned at any rate.</p><p>“You expect me to believe that you aren’t going to go after a <em>book</em>?” Wilfried asked. Charlotte looked just as doubtful.</p><p>I puffed out my cheeks and said, “I’ll have you know that I turned down an invitation to the palace library! Even I can exercise some self control when my life or my family’s lives are on the line!”</p><p>“Thank the gods for that,” Wilfried sighed as Charlotte muttered, “May my sister be blessed by Duldsetzen and Mestionora.”</p><p>“Anyway,” I said, glaring at both of them, “we agree that this doesn’t leave this room, right?”</p><p>“Right,” they both said.</p><p>They still seemed a little doubtful that I would be able to resist obtaining the book, but I was fully confident in my self control.</p><p>After all, I had another source if I wanted to read it.</p><p> </p><p>After the Dedication Ritual, I invited Hannelore to come over while Clarissa and some scholars from both our duchies tallied results and compiled data. We drank tea with my little sister in the corner as we talked amicably. I made sure Wilfried was in the room to offer support, and he would come by on occasion to check on us.</p><p>When he asked about how Lestilaut’s classes were coming, Hannelore said, “He’s taking them seriously now and should be finished soon. I had to write to Mother to let her know he’d become so absorbed in his drawing that he’d let his attendance slip.”</p><p>Charlotte laughed and said, “Lady Hannelore, you are entirely like Rihyarda when she stops my dear sister from finding some absurd excuse to read.”</p><p>Wilfried smiled. “You have a point, but I would much prefer a cute warning from someone as blessed by Efflorelume as Lady Hannelore to a scolding from Rihyarda.”</p><p>Hannelore flushed as I struggled not to spit out my tea. As Rihyarda called out his name in a voice that could rip his flesh from his bones, I stared at him in disbelief. I heard my brother was a natural Casanova, but I never imagined <em>this!</em></p><p>
<em>Geez, bro! It’s okay to be a lady killer, but don’t actually kill her!</em>
</p><p>Glancing around furtively, I passed my friend a sound-blocking tool and asked as I brought my teacup to my lips, “Lady Hannelore, is that Bluanfah I see?”</p><p>She began to fret as she hurriedly brought her own teacup up to block her mouth as she replied, “N-N-No, of course not. Forgive me, I-I-I…”</p><p>“This is just between the two of us,” I assured her, “but it appears Sterrat may tie my brother’s star upon the whims of Liebeskhilfe without heeding Bluanfah’s song. You see, he delights in spring for another.”</p><p>Her eyes widened, her teacup forgotten. “Oh, my! Truly? Then who does he delight in spring for?”</p><p>“Why, one blessed by Efflorelume.”</p><p>Hannelore was so adorable when her face matched the color of her hair! “B-but wasn’t he engaged to…?”</p><p>“My retainer, yes,” I said. “She was to be his second wife. They have an amicable relationship, that much is certain, but one never forgets the first breath of spring.”</p><p>“Th-the f-f-first…?”</p><p>I nodded and turned to face her, completely serious. “I know this is selfish of me, but I’m sure you can forgive me since you know how much I care for my family and how wonderful my brother is. It’s just… I’ve heard there’s a tradition in Dunkelfelger, and that it can supersede even an order from the Zent. I had encouraged Wilfried to ask you about it, but he was afraid to put any undue pressure on you. That’s why I wanted to ask you first. Would you accept if Wilfried asked to ditter for your hand?”</p><p>She dropped her teacup and the tool. The crash startled everyone, and Wilfried rushed over from where he’d run to hide from Rihyarda. “Lady Hannelore, are you alright?” he asked, taking her by the hand and pulling her away from the mess to allow her attendants to clean it up. “You’re not hurt, are you?”</p><p>“N-n-no!” she squeaked. “I-I’m fine! I’m sorry! I didn’t mean–”</p><p>“There’s no need to apologize,” he said. “You didn’t burn yourself, did you?” After looking at her fingers, he clicked his tongue and offered her Heilschmerz’s healing. “There, just in case.” When he looked up, he saw everyone staring at him. He flushed an adorable shade of red before dropping her hands. “Sorry! I’m sorry! I didn’t…uh… Sorry, Lady Hannelore…”</p><p>As Hannelore gave her flustered reply and stepped away with her attendants to get cleaned up, I exchanged a look with Charlotte. Maybe my story wasn’t so far off the mark after all.</p><p>The next day, I got a letter from Hannelore.</p><p>
<em>Dear Rozemyne,</em>
</p><p>
<em>If Wilfried were to ask, I would gladly accept.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Your friend,</em>
</p><p>
<em>Hannelore</em>

<p>I clenched my hands together in front of me to hide their shaking as I walked down the hall with my retainers towards the door labeled “7.” My friend Lady Rozemyne had invited me to a tea party, but after her question last time and Lord Wilfried’s reaction after I dropped my teacup, I was nervous. Why had I sent that note? Was he really going to ask? Did he truly delight in spring for me?</p><p>When I finally arrived at the Ehrenfest dormitory, Brunhilde, the one Lord Wilfried was originally engaged to, led me to their tea party room where Lady Rozemyne, Lady Charlotte, and Lord Wilfried were waiting.</p><p>“Thank you so much for responding to my invitation!” Lady Rozemyne said with her dazzling smile. “I’m ever so glad we could get together like this.” She was always so full of energy, even when she was so obviously tired. I wished I could be as outgoing as her.</p><p>“Y-Yes, me, too,” I stammered, looking at everything but Lord Wilfried and admonishing myself for sounding so silly. I hadn’t known for sure that he was going to be attending, but now that he was here, only one question filled my mind: was he going to ask?</p><p>Once I sat down, our attendants started serving the sweets that we’d both provided. Ehrenfest had Mont Blancs, a crunchy cookie called meringues, and refreshing cream and fruit tarts. I’d brought pound cake with rohres. As usual, everything was delicious. Ehrenfest really had some of the best food.</p><p>We had a polite, pleasant opening conversation, my heart pounding more and more whenever Lord Wilfried spoke. Unlike me, he had no problem making prolonged eye contact and saying sweet things. I still remembered the first time he’d told me I was blessed by Efflorelume. My heart had fluttered so much that I could barely speak afterwards. I’d been a little upset when I’d learned he’d been engaged to Brunhilde, but not as much as I was when his engagement to Lady Detlinde was announced since a consort couldn’t have multiple wives.</p><p>At the time, however, I’d told myself I was being silly for even thinking about it. Lord Wilfried was such a kind, generous person, and I had obviously read too much into his words and actions. According to Lady Rozemyne, his sister, however, I hadn’t read into it enough. Just thinking about her talking of his first breath of spring made my hands tremble slightly. Was he going to ask?</p><p>When the conversation shifted to books, I was a little disappointed. This was going to be a normal tea party like any other I had with Lady Rozemyne.</p><p>“Thank you ever so much for lending me such a wonderful book,” she said. “It has so many stories of the gods I’d never heard before.”</p><p>Lady Charlotte gave me a warm smile. “Indeed. I’m finding it fascinating as well.”</p><p>“Yeah!” Lord Wilfried agreed. “I really liked the story about Mestionora being able to use the divine instruments of all the gods. It’s just like Rozemyne!”</p><p>“Oh my, but do you not also use them, Wilfried?” she asked with a bright smile.</p><p>He grinned back. “Maybe, but my hair isn’t blessed by the God of Darkness and my eyes by the Goddess of Light, now are they?”</p><p><em>Maybe not,</em> I thought, <em>but they are still beautiful. Oh, but a boy wouldn’t like to be called beautiful… This is why I don’t compliment people. I’m just not as good at it as Lord Wilfried or Lady Rozemyne are.</em></p><p>Lady Charlotte covered her mouth as she giggled. “The description does match you perfectly, Sister.”</p><p>“Well,” Lady Rozemyne said, “the story about Verfuhremeer was fascinating, too. Lady Hannelore, does Dunkelfelger ever use that ritual you displayed for us to cool the hot weather?”</p><p>“Um… No, not that I know of,” I said, sorry to disappoint her.</p><p>“Hmm… It might be a fun experiment to try next summer,” she said. “If you sincerely pray and offer your mana, I bet the goddess would answer and bring the temperature down.”</p><p>“Oh, um, maybe we can try it…?” It wasn’t something I ever thought about doing, and I wondered if it would even work since I wasn’t a part of the temple like the three Ehrenfest archduke candidates were. Things must have been so different in their duchy. The temple in ours was not a place anyone wanted to step foot into or be associated with.</p><p>“Have you started reading the book I lent you?” Lady Rozemyne asked.</p><p>I blinked for a moment then nodded with a soft smile. “Yes, it’s quite lovely. I do so enjoy the romance stories Lady Elantra writes.”</p><p>Lady Rozemyne went to speak, but Lady Charlotte put a hand on her arm and looked to Lord Wilfried. He cleared his throat and said, “Um, L-Lady Hannelore?”</p><p>My pulse instantly spiked as my stomach fluttered. Was he going to ask? “Y-Yes?” I asked, kicking myself for stuttering.</p><p>He cleared his throat again, looking so adorably nervous. “I hear you enjoyed all three volumes of <em>Royal Academy Love Stories.</em>”</p><p>I smiled to hide my disappointment. He just wanted to talk about books. I’d been getting ahead of myself. “Oh, uh, yes, they were quite enjoyable.”</p><p>“Could you recognize any of the ones with people from Dunkelfelger?”</p><p>Looking up at the ceiling, I thought about the stories that involved ditter because those were the ones most likely to be from my duchy. Everything was done through ditter at home, much to my chagrin. “Well, a few,” I admitted. “There were some I suspected were probably from Dunkelfelger, but I couldn’t say for sure.”</p><p>Lord Wilfried nodded at my answer and then glanced at his sisters, who were now turned to face each other instead of us. As he reached into his pocket, my heart started racing again. “I hope you’ll recognize this one in the future, then,” he said, “and that it’ll have a happy ending.”</p><p>When I saw what he was handing me, I gasped. It was a feystone necklace. I gingerly took it, and when I read the words inscribed just below where his crest and an impressive magic circle were engraved, my eyes widened, and I covered my mouth.</p><p>
<em>For you, I would ditter all of Dunkelfelger.</em>
</p><p>“Lord Wilfried,” I whispered, “I…”</p><p>When my words failed me, he stepped in to save me. “I know you’re not the biggest fan of ditter,” he confessed. “Anyone with eyes could tell that much.”</p><p>I lowered my head and smiled. <em>No one</em> seemed to understand I didn’t like ditter, but to him, it was as obvious as the sun rising in the morning. How could a boy be so wonderful?</p><p>“But,” he continued, “if this is the only way, then I’ll ditter anyone and everyone. I may be from Ehrenfest, but I can follow the Dunkelfelger way - Obtain what you desire. Gather the strength required to win. Face the challenge as many times as it takes. Change your technique, change your equipment, but never give up. I don’t intend to give up, Lady Hannelore, so long as you don’t want me to.”</p><p>I never thought talking about ditter could make my heart flutter so.</p><p>To my embarrassment, I felt tears sting my eyes. Grasping the necklace in my trembling hands, I forced my answer past my tightening throat. “I…I want you to win!”</p><p>There! I said it!</p><p>The smile he gave me was enough to break my heart and glue it back together. I could see my head attendant practically squirming with the effort to keep in her squeals of delight.</p><p>He put his large hand on top of mine and said, “I promise I’ll win. No one can beat me when I have my sisters on my side.”</p><p>I was surprised I didn’t pass out right then and there. I looked over at Lady Rozemyne and Lady Charlotte who both nodded to me.</p><p>“That said,” Lady Charlotte interjected, “we need to talk about the political realities of the situation. As it stands right now, I’m currently favored to be the next aub. My brother has a stain on his reputation that will never go away, and he was slated to become the next knight commander before his engagement to Lady Detlinde. However, with you as his first wife, he will have a strong enough position to compete for aub once again. This will not guarantee his inheritance. I’m sure you understand why.”</p><p>I nodded. I’d heard rumors that Lord Wilfried had committed a crime when he was younger, but since no one from Ehrenfest seemed to treat him poorly in the least, I didn’t think it was that big of a deal. Still, I understood how something that seemed insignificant to outsiders might be completely different to those involved. Whatever he’d done, it was bad enough to remove him from consideration for the next aub, and Lestilaut would not be happy with the idea of marrying me off to a knight commander in a lower-ranked duchy, even if that duchy was Ehrenfest.</p><p>Gripping my charm tighter, I tried to think of a way to convince my brother. Father had commanded him to find a way to strengthen our connection with Ehrenfest. Maybe I could use that to convince him?</p><p>“We are not foolish enough to believe your side will agree to a bride-taking ditter and have their princess marry a man from a lower-ranking duchy, who may or may not be aub. We do have a plan, however, and I would like to hear your opinion on it. Do you feel we’ll have a strong enough position to get your brother to sign a ditter contract with us?”</p><p>When Lady Charlotte shared her plan, hope bloomed in my chest.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re kidding, right?” Lestilaut asked, killing my new-found hope with three small words. “You want me to agree to let you ditter for my little sister’s hand when she’s not even guaranteed to become first wife? Because you’re going to have an archduchess instead? What’s even in this for us?”</p><p>Lady Charlotte didn’t back down, however. “If we lose,” she said, “I’ll become your wife, cementing your relationship with Ehrenfest. You <em>are</em> looking for ways to forge stronger connections with us, are you not?”</p><p>She was such a strong person. She would make a perfect first wife in Dunkelfelger, unlike someone like me who was too easily cowed into a corner.</p><p>“You?” Lestilaut scoffed. “What’s so special about you? You may have healed those knights, but can you even summon the other divine instruments like your siblings?”</p><p>“Brother!” I yelled at him. “Don’t be so rude!”</p><p>He ignored me, like he always did.</p><p>Lady Charlotte’s smile didn’t falter as she stood, took several steps back, summoned her schtappe, and chanted, “<em>Lanze!</em>” Leidenschaft’s spear appeared in her hands, glowing a soft blue. Moments later, it began to crackle, making all of us leap back and produce shields.</p><p>She made such a beautiful figure standing proudly with the God of Fire’s own lance sparking with mana, like a graceful warrior ready to go to battle. I could tell from the way that she held her weapon that she’d practiced with it before, even if she wasn’t as skilled as those of us in Dunkelfelger.</p><p>“Put it away!” Lestilaut barked.</p><p>She complied and came back to her seat, sipping her tea as if nothing happened.</p><p>“What sort of monsters are you…?” he muttered.</p><p>“The sort that will obliterate you at ditter,” Lady Charlotte replied, not missing a beat.</p><p>He scoffed and waved her off. “Please. While it’s true my father wants a stronger connection, I don’t think you’re of equal value to my little sister.”</p><p>“Brother!” I objected again.</p><p>“You’re from the Second,” he said, not even looking at me. “This girl is from the Seventh. They’re a backwater duchy that rose in the ranks due to no merit of their own. The only things they have going for them are Lady Rozemyne and Lord Ferdinand. And Lord Wilfried, I guess, to a lesser extent. All of your trends come from Lady Rozemyne. Your new industry comes from Lady Rozemyne. Your grades are a result of Lady Rozemyne. Even your divine instruments came from her influence, yes?”</p><p>“Actually,” Lady Rozemyne said, “my siblings learned to summon the divine instruments while I was in a jureve. Also, both of my siblings are involved in the printing industry. Charlotte is currently heading up our joint research with Drewanchel even though she’s only a second year and not planning to take the scholar course. She’s also the source of many of our fashion trends. While I may have started flower hairpins, she has been the one to popularize our unique hemlines, embroidery styles, and appliques.”</p><p>Her claims were all true. Lady Charlotte had spread several fashion trends throughout the Academy. Even the dress Lady Rozemyne currently wore had the flowers made of fabric that Lady Charlotte debuted this year. They were made with cloth that had been dyed after Ehrenfest fashion, making them fade gradually from red to white. The edges were then embroidered with the thinnest gold line. They were quite stunning. I imagined they would start including them in hairpins soon if they hadn’t already.</p><p>“Thank you, Sister,” Lady Charlotte said. “Do you want to know what else I bring to the table? The ability to forge alliances. How do you think the former Seventh felt when we took their place? What about the other lower-ranked duchies who’d clawed their way up to where they were only to be overtaken by a neutral duchy ‘with nothing to its name’? Tell me, how many negative rumors have you heard about us? How many backhanded compliments or outright insults have been spoken? I daresay you could count on one hand the number of duchies who still have a negative view of us despite all of our ‘shortcomings.’”</p><p>Lestilaut blinked at her for a moment before he looked over his shoulder at his scholar. Kentrips stepped forward and whispered in his ear for a moment. His confirmation of Lady Charlotte’s claims left my brother speechless for a moment. After he regained himself, he said, “Are you even able to perform the pre-ditter blessing?”</p><p>“Such blessings require sincere prayers to the gods,” she said. “As we are not about to play ditter, I cannot be sincere. However, I could grant you Angriff’s blessing this very moment if you would like proof of my worth.”</p><p>“Do it.”</p><p>I wanted to protest, but Lady Charlotte just gave him a peaceful smile and got to her feet. She beckoned those who wished to be blessed to kneel around her. The knights hurriedly obliged followed by the scholars. Some of the attendants joined, too, but most stayed back to watch. When I saw the number of students surrounding her, I started to get nervous. Could she really bless this many people at once? The amount of mana that would take would be staggering.</p><p>My brother got up and moved to the center of the circle, standing right in front of Lady Charlotte, using his glare, height, and gravitas to try to intimidate her, but she didn’t back down. She just smiled sweetly up at him as if daring him to make a move. In the end, he snorted and knelt down in front of her.</p><p>As she began to pray in her soft but strong voice, her red ring started to glow. When she finished, the light shot into the air, turning blue and expanding over the ceiling in waves before raining down in shimmering sparkles that looked just like the fireflies that danced in the fields in the summer dusk. The lights glinted off her silver-gold hair, casting her in an ethereal light. As my brother stared up at her, I could tell he was enchanted.</p><p>I was suddenly even more worried about our parchment supply.</p><p>“Lord Lestilaut!” Rarstark yelled. “Let’s go play a game of speed ditter to see what this blessing has done!”</p><p>My brother came out of his stupor and glared at him. “Fine. Form three squadrons. Scholars of the sword, too. Let’s see if these sparkling lights did anything!”</p><p>I hurriedly sent an ordonnanz to Professor Rauffen who joyously met us at the practice grounds. Nothing could stop him from coming to observe a game of ditter, not even death. Why were all the men from Dunkelfelger like that?</p><p>He summoned the feybeast for the first squadron, and they fell upon it. They weren’t as fast or as powerful as when we did the pre-ditter ritual, but the improvement was still astounding, especially since the blessing came from a single person and spread over dozens of people. We’d progressed to the point where all the knights could give themselves a blessing, but no one could give one to everyone.</p><p>Professor Rauffen summoned a more powerful feybeast for the second round and an even more powerful one for the third.</p><p>Once they were finished, all three teams came to where we were and started excitedly reporting the effects of the blessing to my brother. Overall, it had made them faster, stronger, and expend less mana, but to a lesser degree than the blessing from our ritual.</p><p>Still, my brother was impressed. He turned to Lady Charlotte and said, “Perhaps you do have some worth.”</p><p>Rather than be offended, she smiled at him and said, “I thank you ever so much for the praise, Lord Lestilaut.” I didn’t know if she was able to see past his rough exterior or if she just refused to be intimidated, but I still admired her strength, regardless where it came from.</p><p>“It would indeed be nice to have a solid connection with Ehrenfest,” he muttered. “Either way, that’s what we’d get with this.”</p><p>My heart soared with hope.</p><p>“And either way,” Lady Rozemyne added, “you’d have a means to get your illustrations to us for future volumes of <em>A Ditter Story.</em>”</p><p>That made all the apprentice knights excited, and despite the expression on his face, I knew it pleased my brother.</p><p>When we got back to our tea room, we began drawing up the contract. We had run into a major problem at first - my brother had used up all the parchment on making illustrations for <em>A Ditter Story.</em> Lady Charlotte, however, produced a spare sheet.</p><p>In the end, we agreed on four conditions.</p><p>If Ehrenfest won, I would become engaged to Lord Wilfried.</p><p>Lord Wilfried would have to compete in good faith for the seat of aub.</p><p>Lady Charlotte, if she decided to compete for the seat of aub, would have to do so in good faith and make no moves to actively sabotage her brother.</p><p>If Dunkelfelger won, Lady Charlotte would marry my brother and become his first wife.</p><p>Thus, the contract between me, my brother, Lord Wilfried, and Lady Charlotte was signed.</p><p>Father was so excited about the match that he tried to find a way to come to the Academy to observe, but Mother stepped in to stop him. Adults weren’t supposed to get involved with affairs at the school. The only exception in recent history that I knew of was Lord Ferdinand coming during Rozemyne’s first year to assist with Professor Hirschur’s research on the shumils, but she’d sought out special permission from Prince Anastasius for that.</p><p> </p><p>Six days later, we met Ehrenfest at the training grounds. Professor Rauffen was there to referee for our side, and Professor Hirschur came for their side. She didn’t seem happy, but Lady Rozemyne had told me that she bribed her with some of her fiancé’s research. The students from both our dorms had come out en masse to spectate. On our side, a large magic tool was set up to record the match for Father. Ehrenfest hadn’t provided a recording tool, and it made me want to go there even more. How I longed for a duchy that could do something other than obsess over ditter!</p><p>As I looked at our lineups, I started to get nervous. While we were fielding only our best archknights, Ehrenfest’s low population meant they had mostly mednobles on their side. They even brought three attendants to fill in their numbers. With a deep breath, I held the feystone hanging around my neck, willing the plan to work.</p><p>The knights assigned to guard me circled me as Lord Wilfried and Lestilaut met in the middle of the field. Once they shook hands, they returned to their sides, and we all braced ourselves. The second the ditter bell rang, someone from our side launched a magic tool at Ehrenfest’s knights.</p><p>“Cover your eyes!” Lady Rozemyne bellowed. I smirked to myself. It was the same tool her fiancé had used against Heisshitze during the first ditter game where I’d been the treasure. I’d hoped she’d recognize it.</p><p>When the bright flash faded, none of the Ehrenfest knights were affected, which stunned our side for just a moment. That moment was long enough for them to take advantage of. Several huge magic circles appeared in the air above the three attendants, and then they gushed out so much water that it flooded the arena, washing away most of our knights. The ones around me, however, produced their shields and stood their ground. I pouted slightly, wishing that had been the end of it. By the time the water had disappeared, a yellow dome had appeared around Lady Charlotte, and Lady Rozemyne was spinning Verfuhremeer’s staff.</p><p>I stared slack jawed at her. She’d never even seen the staff before our ritual, and now she was able to produce it and perform the ritual to remove our blessings. She really was a genius saint!</p><p>Our knights cried out in despair as their blessings returned to the gods, but Lestilaut rallied them quickly. “We will not lose from something so insignificant!” he yelled. Moments later, magic tools started exploding around us. Some created flashes of light similar to the one we’d fired at the beginning of the match. Others burst into red powder that made anyone who came into contact with it start coughing as their eyes watered and their noses ran. Still others produced thorny vines that constricted around the victim. While most of their bodies were covered in armor, their faces were not, and the thorns were huge. I was honestly surprised we didn’t have anyone screaming about losing an eye.</p><p>The adult knights in Dunkelfelger had been right. Lord Ferdinand’s tools truly were the stuff of evil. I didn’t understand how someone so scary was engaged to someone so sweet and innocent as Lady Rozemyne, but she was so happy with him. I could only assume he was a completely different person in private.</p><p>As these magic tools were detonating, Matthias started pelting us with arrows from the air. He only managed to injure a few of our knights, but he succeeded in distracting them from the other tools that were being launched. More and more of our people were falling victim to vines or sticky traps that glued our people to the ground or each other. Waschen was enough to get rid of the latter, but the former required someone to cut through them, which took precious time.</p><p>“Rarstark!” Lestilaut barked. Our star player barreled down the pitch, grinning madly. My heart was in my throat as I watched him approach.</p><p>“Move!”</p><p>At Lady Rozemyne’s cry, all of the knights blocking Rarstark from Lady Charlotte shifted, creating a clear line of sight for my friend as she held her water gun just outside the safety of the yellow dome. She fired, and suddenly, ropes wrapped around Rarstark, and he fell to the ground, skidding several paces before he came to a stop, completely limp. It seemed she’d used the same charm that Lord Ferdinand did that put Heisshitze to sleep. Brunhilde used her schtappe to bind him in golden bands and pull him behind her. They were obviously confident that he wouldn’t wake before the match ended.</p><p>My brother clicked his tongue and then ordered the injured to come back and replenish themselves with potions. As the knights moved to start handing them out, however, the boxes of potions and tools exploded, sending shrapnel everywhere. I could see sprays of blood shooting up into the air from where our supplies had been. While there were cries of shock and pain, no one seemed to be permanently injured.</p><p>“What a dirty trick!” Lestilaut bellowed. “You’re no saint, you vile woman!”</p><p>“I never said I was!” she yelled back. “I’m here to win ditter, not favor with the gods!”</p><p>He clicked his tongue again, but before he could issue any more orders, a mass of swirling white caught his eye.</p><p>Across the field, several paces down from the yellow dome, a whirlwind of snow was forming around Lord Wilfried as he held the Sword of Ewigeliebe high in the air and prayed.</p><p>As his hair whipped with the winds and his face lit with the glow of the white feystone blade, I gasped and clutched my necklace even tighter. I’d never seen anything more beautiful.</p><p>“Stop him!” Lestilaut cried. “Go! Go! Go! Don’t let him finish that prayer!”</p><p>Our knights charged, but they met a wall of resistance. Their knights were putting everything they had into blocking us. Whenever they began to give ground, Lady Judithe would fly up into the air and pelt our people with more tools.</p><p>I looked over to where Lady Charlotte and Lady Rozemyne were and noticed the yellow dome was crackling. Lady Charlotte’s face was tight with concentration as she continued to pour more and more mana into maintaining its form, and I realized that the sword was weakening it.</p><p>So did my brother. “Now!” he yelled. “Hand it to me now!”</p><p>His guard knight passed him our duchy’s treasure - a black shield. He was going to use it to drop through Schutzaria’s shield. He sped down the field just as Lord Wilfried finished his prayer and sliced his sword through the air.</p><p>Dozens of snow-born feybeasts flooded the field. The Ehrenfest knights flew up into the air to avoid them, and ours got bogged down fighting them off. My brother, however, simply dodged them and barreled towards the dome on the opposite side. Lord Wilfried fell to his knees as he dismissed the sword before taking a potion that made him grimace. I hoped he would recover in time. If not, my brother was going to win.</p><p>As Lestilaut approached, Lady Rozemyne stepped out of the shield and produced Leidenschaft’s spear, its tip practically lighting up the entire arena with its crackling, incandescent glow. Meanwhile, Lady Charlotte was downing a potion, and Lord Wilfried was getting to his feet.</p><p>When my brother drew close, Lady Rozemyne got into a throwing stance and held her spear at the ready. She waited until he was almost upon her then threw. Lestilaut blocked it with his shield, absorbing all that mana, and laughed as the spear disappeared. By the time he landed inside the dome, Lady Charlotte already had the same lance formed, though it wasn’t quite as bright as Lady Rozemyne’s had been.</p><p>She held it out, and she and my brother began pacing around the dome. Lord Wilfried gave them a glance before mounting his highbeast and flying towards us with one of his guard knights. Nearly all of our people were occupied with the snow feybeasts and the Ehrenfest knights, so Lord Wilfried encountered little resistance as he came for me.</p><p>A bright flash caught my attention, and I looked over to see Lady Charlotte slamming her spear into the shield. The light drained from it, but it didn’t disappear like Lady Rozemyne’s. However, our duchy’s treasure did. It crumbled into gold dust in my brother’s hands. He screamed at her moments before being violently ejected from the shield, only to be caught in bands of light by Lady Rozemyne. She stood over him, a triumphant grin on her face as he struggled to free himself. It appeared, however, that she somehow had more mana than he did, even though he was older than she was and set to become the next Aub Dunkelfelger!</p><p>“Good gods, what do they feed those kids in Ehrenfest?” one of the knights surrounding me asked.</p><p>“Lady Hannelore!”</p><p>I looked up at Lord Wilfried who was drawing ever closer. The knights readied their swords and shields as I gripped the feystone charm and started chanting the spell they’d given me to activate it. Soon enough, we were surrounded by our own yellow shield.</p><p>“What’s this?” one of the knights asked.</p><p>Another smiled and said, “Now we’re invincible! I thought this was bride-taking ditter, but I guess you changed your mind, huh?”</p><p>I ignored them as I trained my eyes on Lord Wilfried. He aimed his highbeast right for us, pulling out his schtappe and chanting a spell none of us could quite hear. It transformed into a black cape, and he wrapped it around himself. Just before he made contact with the dome, he dismissed his highbeast and tumbled inside, rolling to a stop right next to me.</p><p>“Hey, what?!” one knight shouted.</p><p>“How’d he do that?!” yelled another.</p><p>“He doesn’t have a black shield!”</p><p>“It’s the cape!”</p><p>Suddenly, they lifted their swords to attack, but just like my brother, they were thrown from the shield.</p><p>It started to crackle as Lord Wilfried leapt to his feet. “Lady Hannelore,” he said with his warm, endearing smile, holding out his hand, “will you come with me to Ehrenfest?”</p><p>Once again, I felt my eyes heat with tears as I nodded and took his hand. He summoned his pale, almost-white lion-shaped highbeast and pulled me up onto it with him before blasting from the Dunkelfelger base. The shield shattered mere moments before we passed through it.</p><p>My heart filled with exhilaration, and I was overcome with the flush of victory as Professor Rauffen called the end of the match.</p><p>That was the only excuse I could fathom for why I threw my arms around Lord Wilfried and kissed him.</p>

<p>I tumbled inside the shield made from the charm my sister and all our scholars helped me make. The knights guarding Lady Hannelore figured out almost immediately how I’d gotten inside.</p><p>As expected of the fine knights from Dunkelfelger.</p><p>They didn’t piece together, however, that any malice directed at anyone inside would cause a person to get thrown from the dome.

<p>Sylvester paced the length of his office, chewing on his thumbnail, while Ferdinand attempted to tap a hole into his temple. Karstedt sat with his head in his hands, pulling at his hair hard enough to go permanently bald. Each heartbeat lasted a bell as they waited for news from the Academy.</p><p>Finally, a scholar came in with a letter. Sylvester immediately opened it and started reading out loud.</p><p>
<em>Aub Ehrenfest,</em>
</p><p>
<em>The ditter game is complete. Thanks to the cunning plans of Lady Rozemyne and Lady Charlotte, we won the game.</em>
</p><p>Sylvester collapsed into his chair and let his head hit the desk. “Thank the gods and all their capricious children,” he sighed.</p><p>“Don’t thank them yet,” Ferdinand growled.</p><p>“What? Why? I didn’t lose two of my kids! Why shouldn’t I be thankful?”</p><p>Ferdinand furrowed his brows and said, “Ehrenfest has just openly defied an order from the king.”</p><p>Sylvester held his head in his hands and cursed as Karstedt pulled at his hair. “You said we already look suspicious, too. What’s going to happen to us?”</p><p>Sighing heavily, he said, “I don’t know. Ahrensbach is not in a favorable position, either, and we have proven to be of great worth with the joint research with Dunkelfelger. Perhaps we can spin this as young people blinded by Bluanfah’s enchanting dance. By the time we knew anything about it, the children had already signed the contract.”</p><p>Sylvester nodded. “I think I could make that work.” Then, he went back to reading the letter. It described the game in detail, and with each move, Sylvester or Karstedt would cry out in surprise or admiration.</p><p>“Who uses divine instruments in ditter?!” Karstedt yelled.</p><p>“Can you even imagine seeing someone using Ewigeliebe’s sword while two other people are over there wielding Leidenschaft’s spear?” Sylvester asked. “I wish I could’ve been there!”</p><p>
<em>As Lord Wilfried sped down the field, Lady Charlotte attacked Lord Lestilaut with her spear, and she turned the black shield, said to be an ancient treasure of Dunkelfelger, to gold dust.</em>
</p><p>The color drained from Sylvester’s and Karstedt’s faces. “Sh-she destroyed their…?” Karstedt stammered.</p><p>“Wh-what do we say to Aub Dunkelfelger at the Interduchy Tournament?”</p><p>“‘We’?” Ferdinand asked.</p><p>“Yes! We! Don’t abandon me in my time of need!”</p><p>Ferdinand snorted. “It doesn’t matter, even if he’s upset. You must be prepared to lose everything on the ditter field, even your life. He understands this.”</p><p>“Yeah, I’m going to make you say that to him.”</p><p>
<em>When Lord Lestilaut was thrown from the shield, Lady Rozemyne bound him with bands of light, which he could not free himself from, no matter how he tried.</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand leapt to his feet. “No! That fool! Does she not realize what flaunting her superior mana quantity over the future Aub Dunkelfelger will do?!”</p><p>Sylvester let his forehead drop against the desk. Then, he snapped his head back up. “You two are already engaged! The royal family can’t take her!”</p><p>“They absolutely can!” Ferdinand said. “All it takes is a royal order, and using ditter only works if Dunkelfelger is involved. Not only can they take her, they can force her to marry one of those fool princes!”</p><p>Shaking his head, Sylvester said, “I don’t think they’ll make a move. Royalty wasn’t watching, and Lestilaut won’t want to publicize this. There was so much going on at the same time, too, that the number of people who saw is likely limited.”</p><p>Ferdinand grit his teeth but sat back down to listen to the rest.</p><p>The letter detailed Wilfried’s gambit where Hannelore activated a shield charm, and he used the God of Darkness’ cape to enter and trick her guards into expelling themselves from their base. The tactic brought grins to all three men.</p><p>
<em>Lord Wilfried took her from the base on his highbeast, and then we declared the winners.</em>
</p><p>
<em>We shall leave the reporting of these results to Ahrensbach to our aub.</em>
</p><p>
<em>—Ignaz</em>
</p><p>“Gods, what do I say to him?” Sylvester said. “Ugh, I don’t want to!”</p><p>Ferdinand tapped his temple as he frowned. “The question now is how they will retaliate. Detlinde will still need a consort, and this is yet another insult to them. We may appear to have the second prince on our side, but he could turn on us in the blink of an eye. Even if he remains steadfast, he is not powerful enough to protect us from the king. We need to move carefully.”</p><p>Suddenly, Sylvester perked up and said, “I’m being contacted. Excuse me.” He then left for the water mirror.</p><p>While he was gone, Ferdinand began writing his scathing letter to all three of their gremlins at the Royal Academy.</p><p>“Ferdinand!”</p><p>He looked up at his brother who was waving for him to follow. When he entered the room, he suppressed a groan. “Aub Dunkelfelger.”</p><p>“FERDINAND!” the aub yelled from the water mirror. “The Lord of Evil! Your fiancé and disciples are worthy of you indeed! I haven’t seen such a fine game since your days in the Academy! No, this may have even been finer!”</p><p>Ferdinand furrowed his brows. “Did you go to the Academy?”</p><p>“What?” the aub asked. “No! Sieglinde wouldn’t let me. I sent a recording device! I shall bring both of you to our tea party room to watch the glory of your archduke candidates winning an excellent game of ditter during the Interduchy Tournament!”</p><p>He grimaced, unable to say no given their rankings.</p><p>“That said, we need to discuss the terms of the game,” Aub Dunkelfelger said, his expression turning serious. “My Hannelore is now engaged to your son, Aub Ehrenfest, and my understanding was that he was engaged by royal decree to Ahrensbach’s archduke candidate.”</p><p>Sylvester decided to play dumb. It was better to let an upper-ranked duchy take the lead in situations like these. “Yes,” he said, sighing, “I’m not sure how this works since consorts cannot have second wives.”</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger narrowed his eyes and then laughed. “I see! You are unfamiliar with our glorious ways! Ditter is sacred in Dunkelfelger. One of our own was Zent, you know, and he codified our ditter games. Bride-taking and bride-stealing ditter supersede everything, including Zent’s orders! It cannot be undone. Your boy is marrying my daughter and therefore cannot marry the girl from Ahrensbach. Was this not a plan of yours or Ferdinand’s?”</p><p>He shook his head. “We didn’t know about it until after the contract was signed.”</p><p>“Oh, I see. They kept us in the dark about it as well. These rascals!” He started laughing again then said, “It truly was a spectacular game! The contract says that your boy has to compete for aub in good faith, but should his sister or younger brother take the seat, would you consider letting him marry into Dunkelfelger? We’d love a player like him! And he can summon divine instruments and give blessings during our pre-ditter ritual!”</p><p>Sylvester stared in shock for several moments as Ferdinand hid a grimace. It would be difficult to refuse a direct request like this, and there was no chance of Wilfried overtaking Charlotte in the race for aub. Aub Ehrenfest, however, was nothing if not gifted in slithering out of troublesome situations. He gathered himself enough to say, “If he doesn’t become aub, he will become knight commander.”</p><p>“And a fine knight commander he’d be, but to have an archduke candidate from Dunkelfelger marry the knight commander from the Seventh… Surely you see where I’m coming from.”</p><p>Sylvester gulped. “Should we not include Wilfried and Hannelore in this discussion and hear their opinions? Besides, if he marries into Dunkelfelger, he won’t be able to take other wives, and he was engaged before the king’s order to an archnoble here in Ehrenfest.”</p><p>“And yet he competed so valiantly for my daughter’s hand!” the aub argued. “The other engagement has long since been dissolved. Why bring up ancient history? Is it not an honor to have one of your own marry into Dunkelfelger?”</p><p>Crossing his arms, Sylvester said, “So will Hannelore compete for the seat of aub?”</p><p>“No, Lestilaut has been named my heir.”</p><p>“Then will he be demoted to an archnoble status if he marries into Dunkelfelger? Here, regardless of whether he’s aub or knight commander, he will remain an archduke candidate and a supplier for the foundation.”</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger shook his head. “She would remain a candidate, and so would he. We were considering having her marry an archnoble and demoting her, but not now that she’s engaged to an archduke candidate.”</p><p>“Is this not a moot point until they come of age?” Ferdinand asked. “If he becomes aub, then he’ll be in Ehrenfest regardless.”</p><p>“Right,” Sylvester said. “We can discuss this in the event Wilfried does not inherit.”</p><p>“Hmm… Very well,” the aub said. “Don’t forget! You’re coming to watch the match during the Interduchy Tournament! It truly is spectacular! Congratulate your kids for me!” With that, the aub’s face faded in a series of ripples.</p><p>Sylvester leaned against the water mirror and sighed heavily. “So Wilfried’s in the running again now that they’ve won.”</p><p>“So it appears,” Ferdinand said, a bitter taste in his mouth. “He’s not suited to it, but as the only requirement is to compete in good faith, I see no eventuality where he actually inherits. Charlotte is far superior. She needs only to find an archduke candidate to marry, and Drewanchel has plenty.”</p><p>“Yeah,” he said, “Aub Dunkelfelger’s heir wanted to take her as a first wife, so she shouldn’t have any issues finding someone. I still can’t believe they planned this. I take that back. I can absolutely believe Rozemyne would do this, but how did she get Charlotte to go along with it? And how did we not notice?! How’d they even find out about that obscure Dunkelfelger law?”</p><p>Ferdinand looked away.</p><p>“So this is your fault?!”</p><p>“We should focus on what’s important - summoning those problem children so we can lecture them properly.” Ferdinand turned on his heel and headed out the door.</p><p>“Don’t you walk away from me! Get back here so I can yell at you!”</p><p>Ferdinand ignored him and went back to the office, penned a letter to the three headaches, and sent it to the Academy. He got a reply half a bell later.</p><p>
<em>To my fiancé,</em>
</p><p>
<em>As much as we would love to return, we are in the midst of preparing for the Interduchy Tournament. We have three joint research projects we’re presenting on, after all.</em>
</p><p>
<em>We look forward to seeing you when you arrive for the tournament.</em>
</p><p>
<em>From your adoring fiancée</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand swore he felt a blood vessel in his temple pop. “So that’s the game you want to play, is it?” he said with a dark smile.</p><p>
<em>To my adoring fiancée,</em>
</p><p>
<em>Home. NOW.</em>
</p><p>
<em>—Ferdinand </em>
</p><p>Only a quarter of a bell passed before all three sources of Ferdinand’s headaches were sitting in Sylvester’s office under a sound-blocking barrier.</p><p>Crossing his arms, Ferdinand glared at Rozemyne and said, “Explain yourself. How does dragging your siblings into bride-taking ditter count as not going on a rampage?”</p><p>Rozemyne wagged a finger in the air and said with her chest puffed out, “I never said I wasn’t going to go on a rampage. I said I wasn’t going to <em>lead </em> any. And I didn’t! This was all Charlotte’s doing.”</p><p>“What?!” all three men yelled at the same time.</p><p>Charlotte merely smiled and said, “It was a joint effort, really. Do not let me take credit for your part, Sister. Are you not the one who suggested we use those devastating tools Uncle created?”</p><p>“Brother Eckhart told me about how effective they were, and no one died! If we’re giving credit where credit is due, wasn’t it Wilfried who said we should use divine weapons?”</p><p>The boy came out of his stupor and stared at Rozemyne as though she betrayed him. “Hey, I didn’t say to destroy Dunkelfelger’s treasure with Leidenschaft’s spear!”</p><p>“That was Charlotte’s doing.”</p><p>“Oh my, but did you not fill it with mana yourself before Lord Lestilaut entered my shield? I barely had to put any in to turn it to dust.”</p><p>“Either way,” Rozemyne said, “You were the one who proposed this idea last spring.”</p><p>“But it would not have worked were it not for your efforts to summon Bluanfah for Lady Hannelore,” Charlotte said with a light giggle.</p><p>Wilfried’s eyes glazed over. “Lady Hannelore and Bluanfah, huh?”</p><p>“Alright!” Sylvester said, cutting their conversation short. He this raised a brow and pointed at Wilfried. “First, you’re going to tell me what those moon eyes are about later.” The boy jerked back and blushed.</p><p>“Yeah,” Sylverster said, nodding to himself, “I definitely need to know about that one. Now, Charlotte. What were you thinking?! How could…you…just…” Sylvester sighed and held his head in his hands. “It’s no good. I can’t do it! I can’t yell at Charlotte!”</p><p>“Shall I do it in your place, then?” Ferdinand asked.</p><p>Sylvester paused to consider and then waved for him to do as he willed.</p><p>Ferdinand leveled his gaze at the girl, and all three children shrank back in fear. “Do you have any idea what you’ve done?”</p><p>He waited for her response, and she finally straightened up and replied, “Yes. I saved my brother from a life of misery by taking advantage of an obscure law that you taught me about before I went to the Royal Academy.”</p><p>Oh, she was trying to shift blame to him, was she? “If you found my tutelage so valuable,” he said, his lips twisting into a smile, “then why did you not inform us of this plan to get our assistance?”</p><p>Charlotte looked down. “Because you would have forbidden us from carrying it out.”</p><p>“You’re right I would have forbidden you!” Sylvester said, his eyes sharp with anger. “Did you even consider how this would look to the king when the royal family is investigating us and Ahrensbach? We’ve defied a royal order, and we’ve left Ahrensbach in the lurch! The king already has reason to suspect us of foul play, and now we’ve created an opening wide enough for Rozemyne’s Gutenberg-sized highbeast to drive through for Ahrensbach to exploit! Did you even stop to think that the royal order might be overturned long before Wilfried came of age once they found irrefutable proof of Ahrensbahc’s guilt?! Instead, we’ve–”</p><p>“We’ve made an ally of Dunkelfelger,” Charlotte interrupted him. “The child of the third queen, who is from Dunkelfelger, is currently favored to be the next king. Whatever the king does to us, they do to Dunkelfegler’s princess, and they will not allow anything to happen to her.”</p><p>“While that is not an incorrect assessment,” Ferdinand said, “there are a number of things they can do to us personally that wouldn’t affect the Dunkelfelger girl. For one, Rozemyne proved she has more mana than Aub Dunkelfelger’s heir. It would be a trifling matter for the king to cancel our engagement, force Sylvester to nullify her adoption, and take her for themselves.”</p><p>Charlotte paled at that, and Rozemyne grit her teeth as she balled her hands into fists. Ferdinand narrowed his eyes, trying to determine if she remembered that scenario taking place or if it was just the idea of it that bothered her.</p><p>“For that matter,” Sylvester said, “if they did take Rozemyne, then they could just as easily send Ferdinand to Ahrensbach since he’s—“</p><p>“NO!”</p><p>Everyone jumped as Rozemyne leapt to her feet and screamed. “They can’t have him!” she yelled. “Not again! I won’t let her kill him again!”</p><p>“Rozemyne, control yourself!” Ferdinand barked.</p><p>Wilfried smacked a feystone against her forehead, then another, then another. “I’m running out!” he yelled as he braced her against himself in a defensive hold and covered her eyes. She continued to try to flail about as she screamed all manner of threats against Detlinde.</p><p>Ferdinand circled the table with his bag of feystones ripped open. He placed stone after stone against her forehead as tears streamed down her cheeks.</p><p>“You don’t understand!” she cried. “She’ll kill him! She’ll kill him if you let him go!”</p><p>Everyone tried to get her to calm down, but it was useless. Pulling her tighter so that he could bend down to speak directly in her ear, Wilfried said in a low voice that only she would have heard had Ferdinand not enhanced his senses, “I’ll get the last two tablets before I let them take Uncle. You have my word.”</p><p>Ferdinand’s eyes widened as Rozemyne started to calm down. “Release her!” he barked. The second Wilfried’s hold broke, Ferdinand grabbed her by the hand and started marching out of the room.</p><p>“Wait! Where are you—“</p><p>The rest of Sylvester’s words were cut off as Ferdinand stepped out of the barrier. When he walked out the door, her guard knights all stared in shock except for Angelica who pulled Stenluke and attacked. Ferdinand summoned a shield and blocked her.</p><p>“Stand down!” Rozemyne said, her voice quavering. Angelica immediately followed orders, sheathing her sword and falling in line behind them.</p><p>“What are you doing?!” Cornelius shouted.</p><p>Ferdinand ignored him as Eckhart got in his brother’s way, reminding him of the order his lady had just given. Her name-sworn knights had already fallen in line behind them. They remained silent, though their expressions betrayed the discomfort they felt with the situation.</p><p>When they got to his office, he opened the hidden room and pulled her inside as Cornelius began to yell about her honor. Ferdinand slammed the door in his face.</p><p>He then turned on Rozemyne. “You took Wilfried to the shrines?!” he demanded.</p><p>“We didn’t visit Ewigeliebe’s and Geduldh’s,” she said, a defiant light in her eyes. “It’s not like either of us can be zent without those tablets, and we needed to increase the quality of our schtappes!”</p><p>“Do you have any idea what you’ve done?!”</p><p>“Yes!” she said. “I did what you told me to! You said to wait until my divine protection ceremony and then go get the rest of the tablets to increase the quality of my schtappe!”</p><p>“I said for <em>you</em> to do it, not to bring Wilfried along!”</p><p>She put her hands on her hips and huffed. “He was sending out blessings left and right because he wasn’t in full control of his mana anymore. I did what I had to do to control my mana, save my brother, and protect you!”</p><p>Ferdinand pressed his hand against his forehead. “You made yourself an enemy of the king twice over!”</p><p>“He doesn’t know I circled the shrines!”</p><p>“Are you certain of that?!” he yelled. “Are you certain no one glanced out of a window and saw your highbeast flying about the grounds?”</p><p>That brought her up short. She stared at him, the blood draining from her face.</p><p>“They’ll think us traitors if they discover what you did!” he said, willing her to understand the gravity of the situation.</p><p>“If that’s the case, then aren’t we already?” she asked. “You already have the book!”</p><p>Ferdinand froze.</p><p>“You must really think I’m a fool,” she huffed. “You knew exactly what I was talking about with the shrines. The only way you would have known is if you circled them yourself, and you knew they led to the book. I know you. You would not have stopped there. You would’ve taken one look at that magic circle and gone to see what it did.”</p><p>He blinked at her in utter shock. “I thought you didn’t finish the shrines. How do you know about the circle?”</p><p>“I remember it,” she said. “I know how to get the book because I’ve done it before. Well, maybe not me, but a version of me. And by the way, you need to explain what’s going on with this second set of memories, too!” She crossed her arms under her chest and glared at him.</p><p>With a defeated sigh, he collapsed into a chair, rested his elbows on his knees, and held his head in his hands. There was no point in hiding anything anymore. She already knew too much. “I do have the Book of Mestionora,” he admitted, “and that feystone—“ His voice cracked, and he couldn’t get the words past the burning lump in his throat.</p><p>He felt her hand patting his head, her slender fingers running through his hair. She waited in silence until he could continue, but he couldn’t make himself say it.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, he decided to change tactics. He’d told her about Adalgisa, and she’d accepted it without so much as a blink. He could tell her this, too, couldn’t he?</p><p>Sighing, he lifted his head but found he couldn’t look her in the eye. Instead, he turned his gaze to the side as he swallowed, feeling the color drain from his face. “Those memories you have of a different weave… I lived them. I’m from that weave.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean you’re from the previous weave?” Rozemyne asked, her eyes wide.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Ferdinand let his head hang as he explained. “I lived through that weave until Dregarnuhr unraveled it. The gods sent me back to a certain point in time so that I could correct a mistake in the previous weave.”</p><p>She sat on the bench next to him, her movements stiff with shock. Part of him wanted to ask what was going through her head, but part of him didn’t want to know. Did she resent him now for keeping this from her? Was she disgusted with him? Did she feel like she no longer knew who he was?</p><p>“So my dreams… The memories… They’re real, aren’t they?”</p><p>He straightened back up. “Perhaps. What do you remember?”</p><p>Her eyes were so full of sorrow that it tore his heart. Did she have no happy memories? Had Mestionora only given her the memories she’d suppressed when she took over Rozemyne’s body?</p><p>“I remember many things,” she finally answered.</p><p>He considered how to tease more answers out of her before asking, “What is the last thing you remember?”</p><p>Wrapping her arms around herself, Rozemyne hunched forward and whispered, “Detlinde murdering you, and me standing there, unable to do anything.”</p><p>“She did not kill me,” he said, closing his eyes against the bitter memory.</p><p>“I’ve seen it every single night since I woke up from the jureve!” she protested. “Do you mean to tell me the memory is a lie? That it’s just a silly nightmare?”</p><p>“No,” he said, “that is not what I said. She simply did not succeed.”</p><p>“But how?” she asked, her eyes begging to be freed from her pain. “How did you survive?”</p><p>How much should he tell her? Should he just pour his soul out to her now? It would be relieving not to carry the burden of the past weave alone anymore, but she was only twelve. Well, thirteen. Either way, she was so young, and there was so, so much tragedy. What if telling her about the events that led to her feystone phobia triggered it in this weave as well? What good would it even do to tell her about events that could no longer happen?</p><p>He decided to go with the simple truth. “You saved me.”</p><p>“I did?” she gasped. “How? You were in Ahrensbach in the supply room. I couldn’t have gotten in.”</p><p>“You teleported with your Book of Mestionora and found a way inside.”</p><p>“You don’t just ‘find a way!’” she yelled. “You have to be registered! There would have been no one who could or would have done that for me! What aren’t you telling me, Ferdinand?”</p><p>Heaving a deep sigh, he shook his head, admitting defeat. “You stole the foundation and became Aub Ahrensbach. You were then able to enter the supply room. Please, do not ask any more about this. It is not a pleasant memory.”</p><p>They lapsed into silence again, neither one willing to look at the other. Eventually, Rozemyne asked, “What was the mistake you needed to correct?”</p><p>He grit his teeth and clenched his fists against the agony that welled up in him from the memory. “I failed you.”</p><p>She took a breath to ask another question but then stopped. A few moments later, she asked with a wavering voice, “Was…was that my feystone? Is that why touching it gave me memories of another me?”</p><p>The burning lump in his throat prevented him from speaking, so he chose to remain silent. It had been five years since he’d returned, five years since she’d died in his arms. How long would he mourn a woman who sat next to him? She was not the same Rozemyne, but she was still his Geduldh. That should have been enough, and yet why did it still cut him so deeply?</p><p>“Yeah, maybe don’t answer that one,” she said, a violent shudder running through her body.</p><p>Gods, had he triggered her phobia?</p><p>No, with her gaze on her lap, she could clearly see the feystones in the cage she kept on her belt, and she wasn’t reacting to them.</p><p>After breathing a sigh of relief, he decided to change the subject. “What else do you remember?”</p><p>She didn’t speak for what felt like an eternity. After the most agonizing wait of Ferdinand’s life, she said, “I remember being in a little child’s body, but why I’m like this now?” She waved a hand over herself.</p><p>“I asked the gods to give you a healthy body that matured according to your age. With how compressed your mana is, you shouldn’t really be able to grow, but Anwachs’ blessing seems not to care how mana or logic works.”</p><p>“Ah, that makes sense.”</p><p>In what realm did that make sense?!</p><p>“My memories are kind of jumbled up,” she said. “I can’t tell which timeline some of them belong to. For instance, I have two different memories of eating fish with everyone, but I don’t know which one was here and which was the other timeline.</p><p>“There are a lot of holes, too. I remember going to the Royal Academy library, but I only have one memory of the underground archive. It was when Schwartz and Weiss took me to the Grutrissheit, but I couldn’t get past the barrier because I wasn’t registered as royalty. I…I remember banging my fists against it and crying because for some reason, if I didn’t get the book, you would die. I…don’t recall what that reason was. Do you happen to know?”</p><p>Punishment by association for Detlinde’s crimes, but he saw no reason to add yet more bad memories to what she already held. “It didn’t matter in the end,” he said. “It didn’t come to pass, so it’s best not to dwell on it.”</p><p>She didn’t seem satisfied with that answer, but she remained silent.</p><p>“What else do you remember?” he prompted.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter because it won’t come to pass, so it’s best not to dwell on it,” she huffed.</p><p>This girl! With a heavy sigh, he said, “Aren’t you suffering enough? Would you ask me to add to it with yet more bad memories? Shouldn’t you instead rejoice that at least you have been spared some of them?”</p><p>She grew silent and stared at her knees for a long moment. “Most of them are small things that I can’t place,” she admitted. “I remember Sylvester telling me I couldn’t write to you anymore because it looked bad. I remember turning Dunkelfelger’s black shield to gold dust.”</p><p>“Ah, hence the plan to attack him with two of Leidenschaft’s spears.”</p><p>“Yeah, I knew it would work. I can’t exactly remember why we were playing ditter, though.</p><p>“I also remember crying alone in my hidden room, and I remember seeing Mother cry, too, but I can’t recall why. As for major events, things like being engaged to my brother, Sylvester asking to remain as the Eighth, you leaving for Ahrensbach, being forced to go to all the shrines by Prince Anastasius and Princess Eglantine so that they could use me to get the book, performing Prince Sigiswald’s wedding, and getting engaged to that bookless scrub.”</p><p>Ferdinand chuckled, unable to help himself.</p><p>“Hey!” she pouted. “It’s not funny!”</p><p>“No,” he agreed, “but the phrasing…”</p><p>“My quality of fiancés just kept degrading in that weave,” she sighed.</p><p>“Oh? And what of the quality of your fiancé in this weave?” he asked with a slight smirk.</p><p>She smiled and said, “Well, you did give me a whole library.” Then, her face fell. “Didn’t you kind of manipulate me into it, though?”</p><p>His stomach sank, and he was unable to find any words.</p><p>“I was nine,” she said, “and I’d just come out of a year-long soak in my jureve. I was really emotionally vulnerable, and you then showed me my heart’s desire a few bells before Sylvester more or less announced our engagement. Doesn’t that seem a little…” Her eyes drifted to the side as her lips pulled into a tight line.</p><p>He wanted to defend himself, to say that he had asked her multiple times to make sure she was okay with it, that it was for her own protection, that it was necessary to keep her in Ehrenfest, but none of his justifications could get past his lips.</p><p>What had he done?</p><p>Holding his head in his hands, he squeezed his eyes shut as he tried to figure out how he could fix this. He wanted to say that he hadn’t meant to manipulate her, but he absolutely did. Everything he’d done since coming back had been to manipulate events to match his desires, including getting engaged to Rozemyne.</p><p>In the end, the only words he could say were, “I’m sorry, Rozemyne.”</p><p>She sighed and started fiddling with the various items hanging from her belt. “I understand why you did it,” she said. “You’ve always been the type to manipulate situations and people to get the results you want. Really, I think it’s a product of your upbringing. It probably helped you stay alive when you were growing up.”</p><p>That…was true, not that he wanted to think about it.</p><p>“That doesn’t mean it was okay,” she continued. “I’m not a chess piece to be moved at your whims.”</p><p>“I’m…sorry…” he muttered.</p><p>“Look at me.”</p><p>He didn’t want to.</p><p>“Ferdinand. Look at me.”</p><p>He squeezed his eyes shut for several moments as he gathered his courage, and then he turned to face her. She was strong, resolute, but her eyes still betrayed her fear. “Ferdinand, I understand why you did what you did. I understand why you manipulated Matthias and Laurenz and the others to swear their names to me when you did. I understand why you got engaged to me before I even went to the Royal Academy and why you did so many of the things you did. It wasn’t the reason that was wrong, just the method.</p><p>“I’m going to be your wife one day. That means we’re going to be partners. We need to work together if we want to be happy. I want you to trust me. Don’t manipulate me. Include me. Talk your schemes out with me. Let’s make decisions together, not for each other, okay?”</p><p>She was so much better than he deserved. His actions should have made her cut him off like she had Traugott in the previous weave. In fact, were he observing from the outside, he would be scolding her for being too soft and leaving herself open to more exploitation. Why did she trust that he wouldn’t continue his ways? He’d lived for over thirty years like this, but she believed he could change.</p><p>Well, maybe he could. For her. But he was under no illusions that it would be simple or happen overnight. It was going to be a process. He’d have to strip away the habits that had kept him alive and force himself to learn how to open up to another person. Truly open up. While he had been prepared to show her memories that would betray much of what he desperately wanted to keep hidden, that had been a necessity, not a choice. It wasn’t the kind of sincerity she was looking for.</p><p>“I’ll…try,” he said. “I will need you to inform me if I start…falling into old habits.”</p><p>She gave him a warm, heart-breaking smile. “I will.”</p><p>He knew the conversation didn’t fix everything. He knew what he’d done was unforgivable and that she might grow to resent him for his actions during the past five years, but at least she was giving him a chance. He wanted to hold on to it with every fiber of his being.</p><p>“So…” she said, “have any plans you’re playing with?”</p><p>He chuckled, feeling the tension break at last. “A few. We can discuss them another time.”</p><p>Her eyes narrowed as she frowned at him. After scrutinizing him to her heart’s content, she said, “Fine, but don’t you pretend you forgot! It’ll probably be after I come back from the Royal Academy, right?”</p><p>“Yes,” he said. “Probably then.” He’d need to figure out which plans to share with her. Could he tell her about the face masks meant to block the instant-death poison without triggering her feystone phobia? What of his plans to take Alexandria? She was still a child, and he was having trouble discerning what she could and could not handle. He didn’t want to be the source of any more nightmares for her.</p><p>They sat in silence for a bit, the air between them more comfortable than before but still slightly tense. After a moment, Rozemyne began to stir. Her eyes drifted downward as her fingers began to twist around each other. “So… You’re changing a lot in this weave.”</p><p>He fought down his initial inclination to deflect. “I am,” he admitted.</p><p>Her eyes darted about the room as she seemed to work up the courage to say something. Finally, she pulled her lips into a tight line, squeezed her eyes shut, and asked, “Did you think about the consequences of your actions? Or taking responsibility for them?”</p><p>So she already resented him. He should have known. He deserved nothing less. “Of course,” he said, deciding to be more honest than he would have been two bells ago. “I have been carefully considering every move I make, trying to prevent certain events from happening while enabling others to come to pass.”</p><p>Her lips pulled down into an angry frown. “Then why didn’t you try to save Wilfried? You had the power to.”</p><p>He shook his head, closing his eyes. “The only way for me to have helped him in the short term was to forcibly take the throne. I trust you understand why that would have been a terrible idea. If you had but waited, the problem would have likely fixed itself after the investigation into Ahrensbach.”</p><p>“No,” she said, “it wouldn’t have. The royal family isn’t going to let a greater duchy crumble, especially one that was on the winning side. At most they would have executed Lady Georgine and had Detlinde take over since she probably didn’t take part in any of the planning. That would just make them double down on Wilfried’s engagement.</p><p>“We couldn’t afford to wait, either. Our plan relied heavily on taking advantage of Lord Lestilaut’s hot-blooded temperament, and he’s graduating this year. As future aub, his signature on the contract carries a lot more weight than Hannelore’s.”</p><p>Ferdinand blinked in surprise. He hadn’t considered Wilfried’s engagement a priority because he would have had Rozemyne take Ahrensbach by then. Since she didn’t know that, she’d made a plan to save him herself, but he hadn’t expected it to be so well thought-out. Well, with Charlotte taking the lead on it, perhaps he shouldn’t have been surprised at all.</p><p>“Hey!” she objected. “I know what you’re thinking! I can plan things out, too, you know! I don’t always charge forward with half-baked schemes!”</p><p>“I suppose that has happened once or twice,” he conceded, causing her to puff out her pinchable cheeks.</p><p>“Still,” she said, “you could have saved him, but you got mad at us for doing it instead.”</p><p>“Of course I did!” he said. “You put Charlotte, our future aub, on the line while openly defying the king, and you didn’t say a word to any of us! You didn’t even give us enough notice to send you proper support. How did you even brew enough magic tools to terrorize Dunkelfelger as you did?”</p><p>She tilted her head. “I brewed most of them with you, didn’t I?”</p><p>His eyebrows rose in shock.</p><p>He’d been played.</p><p>Perhaps he wasn’t the only manipulative person in this relationship.</p><p>Sighing, he pushed his hair back and relaxed against the wall. “Do not let what I’m about to say leave this room, but…it sounded like an excellent match.”</p><p>“Ehehehe! I have you and Eckhart to thank for that! All those conversations about your past games and making tools with you really helped us form a decent strategy. Oh, and Wilfried playing you and Sylvester and gewinnen. That helped, too.”</p><p>“What?!” he asked, sitting forward and glaring at her. “Those games were just preparation for this?!”</p><p>He’d been played.</p><p>By Wilfried of all people.</p><p>He suddenly felt the need to reevaluate his life.</p><p>The mood changed again in the short silence that followed. Rozemyne shifted uncomfortably and asked, “Ferdinand, can I ask you something?</p><p>“Yes, but I promise no answers.”</p><p>That made her shift around more. She eventually gathered the courage to ask, “Did you get engaged to me because you felt guilty?”</p><p>“What?” He tried to look her in the eye to make sure she wasn’t playing some sort of prank, but she turned her face from him. The way the corner of her mouth was turned down, however, suggested she had asked in earnest. “No,” he said, “I…will admit that I harbor a significant amount of guilt, but that was not my motivation behind seeking your hand.”</p><p>She still refused to look at him as she asked, “So what was it?”</p><p>Clenching his teeth, he turned away from her, his heart galloping with fear and his ears burning with embarrassment. How could he tell her the truth when she was still a child?</p><p>“Please don’t make me say it to someone still in the height of her summer,” he pleaded.</p><p>There was a long pause before she said, “Alright. You promise you’ll tell me someday, though?”</p><p>“Yes, I promise.” He didn’t imagine it would be easy even once she was grown, but he could force the words out. Perhaps when they exchanged feystones, he could call her his all goddess.</p><p>The light started flashing, and Ferdinand leapt to his feet before offering Rozemyne Heilschmerz’s healing. “Come now, you’ve calmed down, and we’ve been in here far too long.”</p><p>She nodded and pulled open the door.</p><p>On the other side was Sylvester, his face a mixture of worry, disbelief, and a touch of anger.</p><p>Ferdinand heaved a sigh and rubbed at his temple.</p><p>It was going to be a long night.</p>

<p>Sylvester stared at Ferdinand over his laced fingers. Between them sat two goblets of untouched vize and an activated sound-blocking tool. So far, Ferdinand had refused to volunteer any information, and Sylvester had yet to ask a question or hurl an accusation. They had both seen the children off back to the Royal Academy and then come directly to the aub’s office. Ferdinand had no idea how long they’d been sitting in silence, but he would not be the one to break it.</p><p>Eventually, Sylvester huffed and leaned back in his chair. “So, care to explain what all that was about? You can start with the mana rampage that had my son putting my adoptive daughter in a grappling hold in the middle of my office.”</p><p>With a sigh, Ferdinand said, “You were here when Elvira and Florencia talked about Rozemyne’s nightmares. One of them is of Detlinde attempting to murder me, and it’s so realistic that she is having trouble distinguishing it from reality.”</p><p>Sylvester covered his eyes. “So when I brought up you going to Ahrensbach…”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>He scratched the back of his head and frowned. “I don’t know what to do about that. It’s not like I can just tell her to stop having nightmares, and she’s obviously already been told they’re not real. Just what kind of magic tool did she activate?”</p><p>“One that no one will ever touch again,” Ferdinand said, his glare darkening.</p><p>“Okay, now what did Wilfried say to her to get her to calm down but put you on edge?”</p><p>Ferdinand couldn’t exactly tell Sylvester about the shrines, tablets, and Book of Mestionora. First, it would probably kill him. Second, it was a conversation for Wilfried to have with his father. Third, it would reveal that Ferdinand had obtained his Wisdom, the very thing the royal family was searching for to keep the country from falling apart.</p><p>“That’s a question for your son,” Ferdinand said. “It was obviously not meant for anyone’s ears but Rozemyne’s. I just happened to be close enough to hear him.”</p><p>“Just spit it out already,” he said. “If it’s something that affects my kids, I need to know about it, don’t I?”</p><p>“Perhaps Wilfried will tell you in his own time.”</p><p>Sylvester slapped his palm against the table, nearly knocking their glasses over. “Damn it, Ferdinand! You’re talking about my kids! <em>My</em> kids! What are you hiding from me?! Whatever it is, I know it’s some big, life-altering thing. Tell me!”</p><p>That man’s gut was too keen. Ferdinand rubbed his temples and tried to find a way out of this. “Apparently, they have some sort of failsafe for the off chance something goes terribly wrong, like Rozemyne getting taken by the royal family.”</p><p>“And so you locked yourself in a hidden room alone with my daughter for, what, a full bell?”</p><p>Ferdinand blinked in surprise. That was the first time he’d ever heard his brother refer to Rozemyne as his daughter, not adoptive daughter. Had her spending more time at the castle allowed them to build more of a familial bond?</p><p>If so, perhaps taking on more of her work at the temple so she could go to the castle more often was worth the effort. She had so desperately wanted that sort of connection when she was a child living apart from her real family. Even the nobles she considered family were still standing on the other side of the glass from her. He truly hoped that her time in the castle had shattered it.</p><p>“It couldn’t have been a bell,” Ferdinand protested.</p><p>“Uh, yeah, it most certainly was,” Sylvester said. “What the hell were you doing in there with her?”</p><p>“Talking.”</p><p>“Talking?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“About what?”</p><p>Ferdinand sighed and let his gaze travel up towards the ceiling, his mind still reeling from the conversation. “Truthfully? That I’m not a good person.” That was what most of the conversation boiled down to at any rate.</p><p>Sylvester’s face scrunched with anger as he said, “Are you kidding me right now? So, what? Does she want to end the engagement or something?”</p><p>He shook his head. “No. She just…pointed out some severe flaws of mine that…I need to work on.”</p><p>“Oh? Which ones?”</p><p>Ferdinand snorted but said nothing.</p><p>Propping his head on his hand, Sylvester sighed and said, “So you heard Wilfried say <em>something</em>, you dragged her out of the room, fended off an attack from her guard knight, pulled her into a hidden room, and talked about how you’re not a good person? There’s some critical information missing here, Ferdinand, and I need to know what it is. Don’t keep making the same mistake of keeping everything to yourself. I can’t do anything about stuff I don’t know about, and I get the feeling this is something I really, really need to know.”</p><p>Even if he knew, he couldn’t do anything about it. It would only hurt him. Of course, Ferdinand could see Wilfried breaking down under his father’s scrutiny and spilling all the information he had, leaving gaping holes that would only serve to make things worse. Even so, now was not the time.</p><p>“Sylvester, I will tell you at some point in the future, but I cannot now. I must ask you to trust me that you would rather hear about this later.”</p><p>His brother leveled his gaze at him. “Yeah, that’s not going to cut it this time. Not when two of my kids are in deep with whatever it is. You’re not leaving this room until I, Aub Ehrenfest, know what the hell’s going on.”</p><p>Ferdinand grimaced. Sylvester almost never resorted to giving him an order as Aub.</p><p>He had to fight against every fiber of his being, but for the umpteenth time that day, he admitted defeat. He sighed, closed his eyes, and asked, “You’re aware of the various shrines on the Academy grounds, correct?”</p><p>Sylvester crossed his arms. “Yeah. What about them? This better not be another detour.”</p><p>“It’s not,” Ferdinand assured him. “Each shrine is dedicated to one of the gods. You can only enter the ones to the Eternal Five and Supreme Couple if you have all seven affinities and received your schtappe from the Garden of Beginnings, the tree Wilfried mentioned in a past letter.”</p><p>“So what you’re telling me is Rozemyne and Wilfried entered them?”</p><p>“Most of them, yes.”</p><p>Sylvester rested his forehead against his hand and said, “Alright, tell me why that’s such a big deal.”</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Ferdinand clenched his fists on his knees and looked down. “Going to all of them and offering mana to the gods opens the path to the Book of Mestionora, the Wisdom that the royal family seeks.”</p><p>Sylvester fell back in his chair, looking like he was about to faint. He ran his hands down his face and covered his mouth, staring hard into the distance as his mind tried to grapple with what he’d heard.</p><p>Ferdinand waited in silence as he kept an eye on Sylvester’s pallor, making ready to move the moment he started to lose consciousness.</p><p>After Sylvester sat motionless for some time, he reached into a pocket, pulled out some stomach medicine, and downed it with his glass of vize. It was counterproductive, but it wouldn’t cause severe issues, so Ferdinand remained silent.</p><p>“Okay, first, how did you know about it?”</p><p>“It’s written across several stone tablets in the underground archive at the Royal Academy.”</p><p>“The one that just got reopened that might have information on the stages the northern giebes desperately need?”</p><p>Ferdinand nodded.</p><p>With a heavy sigh, Sylvester said, “We need to tell the royal family. You understand that, right?”</p><p>“The only one among them who even has a chance of getting the book already knows about the shrines,” Ferdinand scoffed. “Rozemyne inadvertently took Princess Eglantine to one.”</p><p>Sylvester cursed and said, “Let me guess. Wilfried told Rozemyne that he’d commit treason by getting the book and stealing the throne before he let the zent order you into Ahrensbach, and that was what finally calmed her down. How close am I?”</p><p>“He only promised to get the last two tablets, but one can easily see what that implied,” Ferdinand admitted.</p><p>For the second time in as many weeks, Sylvester slammed his fists against his desk and yelled, “FUCK!”</p><p>Ferdinand didn’t bother to chastise him since he wanted to do the same.</p><p>After Sylvester got his breathing under control, he said, “I’m surprised you only had her in there for a bell and that you had time to talk about anything else. I want to call back both of them so bad and really lay into them.</p><p>“Good gods, what are they thinking?! Are they even thinking?! Do they really intend to throw this country into chaos again?! Gods, even thinking about the wars that would follow… If anyone in the Sovereign Knight’s Order or the royal family finds out what they did, Ehrenfest is going to be the next Werkestock.”</p><p>“Worst case scenario,” Ferdinand said, trying to offer some comfort, “one of your children, who built a strong relationship with Dunkelfelger, flaunts their Wisdom, gets the Sovereign Temple on their side, and likely gains the support of everyone except Klassenberg who would lose power and Ahrensbach for obvious reasons. I believe facing down Dunkelfelger would curtail any thoughts of civil war.”</p><p>Sylvester barked a dry laugh. “Really? That’s worst case? The third queen is from Dunkelfelger, and her son is favored to be the next zent, according to rumors at any rate. You think they’ll give that up so easily over a friendship and engagement between their daughter and my kids?”</p><p>Tapping his temple, Ferdinand said, “I do not believe Magdelena’s presence will pose that grave of a problem. She is only third queen, and the other two queens are from lower-ranking middle duchies. Not only is that a source of embarrassment for Dunkelfelger, do recall that she chose to marry a then-vassal over the person selected by the current and previous Aub Dunkelfelger.”</p><p>“You sure spite isn’t mixed in with that assessment?” Sylvester asked with a raised brow.</p><p>“While I understand why you would think that,” Ferdinand said, “I can assure you, that is not the case. Probe around during socializing and confirm it for yourself. They may look at her more favorably if her son is indeed the favorite to inherit, but I’m confident they would support someone they have a strong connection to with the Book of Mestionora over a third queen with a possible-but-Wisdomless heir.”</p><p>With a groan, Sylvester began to grind his forehead into the desk. “I can’t even imagine how horrible it would be having either Wilfried or Rozemyne on the throne. Gods, he would immediately get taken advantage of somehow, and Rozemyne would use her Grutrissheit to make the whole damn country a library.”</p><p>…He wasn’t wrong.</p><p>After downing three more glasses of vize and filling Ferdinand’s cup twice, Sylvester said, “As if I didn’t have enough to worry about with having to screen candidates for my second wife this year. Now I have to make sure my kids don’t commit treason or somehow become Zent themselves.” He shook his head and chuckled in the manner of those who had given up all hope. “I can’t believe those words just came out of my mouth.”</p><p>Ferdinand nursed his glass of vize and sighed, wishing he could let go of his need for control long enough to give himself over to the alcohol completely. “I did warn you that you didn’t want to know right now.”</p><p>“No!” he shouted, pointing at him with a finger from the hand holding his glass. “This is definitely the kind of thing I need to know about! Good gods, it makes me wonder what else you’re keeping from me!”</p><p>Nothing that he’d ever tell his older brother about, that was for sure.</p><p>After taking another deep draft of his vize, Sylvester said, “I…I need to start planning contingencies. There’s a chance we’ll go up in the rankings this year, meaning we’d overtake Ahrensbach. I don’t see that making Georgine happy, and we recently lost a third or so of our nobles. Most of their kids ended up in the orphanage, so while they’ll provide mana for the duchy, they won’t contribute to the noble population.</p><p>“And then there’s the Leisegangs still acting like we’re a bottom-ranking duchy. Hell, that’s all of us. Except Groschel. I think he gets it now with the traders from other duchies coming in. I have got to find a way to turn their focus outside rather than on internal squabbling. How did Rozemyne do it so easily at the Academy? Seriously, it took all of, what, two minutes to get warring factions to come together.”</p><p>Ferdinand chuckled and drained the last of his vize, turning down an offer for more. “It took her a little longer than that, and it was easier since the children didn’t have decades to spend fostering hate for each other. Also, convincing them to band together against other duchies that they see every day is a small matter compared to your task.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Sylvester drawled. “I didn’t feel hopeless enough yet.”</p><p>He shrugged. He never was one for pretty words, especially after a few glasses of vize.</p><p>Rubbing his forehead against the desk again, Sylvester said, “I have to talk to Aub Ahrensbach tomorrow. Ugh, can I put it off until the Interduchy Tournament? It’ll be a lot easier to face him down with Dunkelfelger at my back, and he won’t have time to plan anything. But did Detlinde write home already? Does she even know? I don’t know how far word spread about their game.”</p><p>Ferdinand pondered his brother’s words as he tapped at his temple again. Detlinde wasn’t the most gifted at gathering intelligence, and that she did gather tended to be unreliable at best. However, this was information about her fiancé, so it wouldn’t be unreasonable for one of the Ahrensbach scholars to at least report to one of Detlinde’s retainers. They would then write to the aub immediately.</p><p>He, too, didn’t know what other duchies had been in the audience. That was information they perhaps could have gotten had the lecture not devolved into…Well, had Rozemyne not fallen victim to his foolishness and then gotten triggered.</p><p>Regardless, if Aub Ahrensbach knew but hadn’t contacted Sylvester yet, then he was likely planning something. How many of his actions would be orchestrated by Georgine, and when would she kill him this weave? What would they do now that they lost Wilfried but no longer had the clout to force Ferdinand into marrying that adulteress?</p><p>Georgine’s main objective was still taking Ehrenfest. With the Ahrensbach bride in the Ivory Tower and all of her name sworn dead, Georgine was going to have a much more difficult time carrying out any schemes, but that just meant she was either going to act in desperation or in ways Ferdinand couldn’t predict.</p><p>He needed to work backwards. She ultimately wanted the foundation. To get it, she would need the key. How would she go about getting the key, and for that matter, how long would it take for her to notice the key was fake?</p><p>“Agh!” Sylvester yelled, cutting into his thoughts. “I’m going to have to pretend my kids aren’t halfway to committing treason while getting scrutinized by the royal family as they investigate Ahrensbach!”</p><p>“Again, I told you you would want to wait—“</p><p>“Ferdinand!”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“Shut up!”</p>

<h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
<p>There were only a few days left until the Interduchy Tournament, so Ferdinand suggested Sylvester wait to contact Aub Ahrensbach. Having Aub Dunkelfelger present during the talk would change their stance considerably.</p><p>Two days after the gremlins returned to the Academy, Ferdinand received a letter from Rozemyne with two hearts next to his name - the code that meant she had an urgent message written in invisible ink. He ordered Karstedt to take over afternoon training and went to his hidden room.</p><p>
<em>To my fiancé,</em>
</p><p>
<em>I was summoned by Prince Anastasius today. He wanted to give us a warning.</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand took a deep breath and braced himself.</p><p>
<em>The Zent will request that Aub Ehrenfest allow me to give the blessing at graduation instead of the Sovereign Temple High Bishop.</em>
</p><p>
<em>He must not refuse.</em>
</p><p>
<em>According to Prince Anastasius, Prince Sigiswald suggested this, saying that since I brought everyone’s attention to the importance of prayer and blessings that I should do a demonstration for all the aubs, and since I can’t go to the Archduke Conference, this is the only opportunity for me to do it.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Prince Anastasius tried to convince the Zent otherwise, saying it would worsen relations with the Sovereign Temple and put undue pressure on Ehrenfest. However, Prince Sigiswald suggested that they use this as a test of loyalty as apparently the whole thing with Ahrensbach somehow makes us look suspicious.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Prince Anastasius was very clear on this point - Aub Ehrenfest must not refuse the request.</em>
</p><p>
<em>He was very apologetic. Well, as apologetic as he ever gets. I think it’s safe to say he’s firmly on our side, though. Apparently, if I understood his roundabout speech correctly, he actually waschened his brother because he was convinced he’d been exposed to trug.</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand sighed and rubbed his temples. There would be no need to drug Sigiswald. He was easier to manipulate than Wilfried in the first weave. All it took was one suggestion from Georgine or Raublut to twist him around.</p><p>
<em>Ferdinand, I’m scared. I recall Sylvester being asked to do this in the last weave, and he refused it. I don’t know, but I feel like it was at least somewhat connected to the forced shrine tour, which led to the royal family trying to take me away.</em>
</p><p>
<em>We need to get ahead of this. I’m going to get the book. That way, even if they do figure out the path and they try to force me to walk it, nothing will happen, so they’ll think I can’t get it. If I can’t get it, then there’s no reason to take me away from my Geduldh.</em>
</p><p>
<em>–Rozemyne</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand pressed his fingertips into his forehead and sighed. Should he just kill Sigiswald?</p><p>He banished the thought from his mind. It would be too difficult to make it look like he died of natural causes at such a young age.</p><p>He turned back to the letter and read through her loose plan again. The premise wasn’t bad, per se, but she needed to flesh it out more. The success of her plan would depend greatly on whether or not she was seen getting her Wisdom. She would undoubtedly be seen giving mana to the statue and vanishing, and filling the circle from above was likely to attract attention as well with the amount of mana it required. He’d been under the cloak of Verbergen when he did it most recently, so he hadn’t been as concerned.</p><p>Sighing again, he pulled out his invisible ink and wrote a reply.</p><p>
<em>Rozemyne,</em>
</p><p>
<em>I will inform Sylvester of the king’s request and have your attendants prepare your ceremonial robes as well as robes for all your guard knights. I do not want you undefended on that stage. I’m certain Hartmut will want to be present as well, and I believe there will be no better shield against those from the Sovereign Temple should they approach you for any nefarious reasons.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I will have Wilfried’s and Charlotte’s ceremonial robes prepared as well. Perhaps if they are seen with you, they will take some of the attention away from you. We do not want you to appear too singular lest you become a target for the Sovereign Temple, royal family, or higher duchies.</em>
</p><p>
<em>You have already been doing so, but continue to share the burden of the public eye amongst yourselves. This will hopefully prove that they merely need to change their practices to achieve similar outcomes rather than steal an extraordinary, singular child from Ehrenfest.</em>
</p><p>
<em>As for your plan, the concept itself is not flawed, but you lack detail in execution. You must ensure you are not seen, and that will only get more difficult the closer to the Interduchy Tournament we get. Therefore, I am entrusting you with these instructions for making an amulet of Verbergen. It will cover you in his shroud, keeping those around you from noticing your presence. They will still notice if you interact with objects or touch them, so be wary of your movements.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I am trusting you not to misuse this.</em>
</p><p>He then wrote the ingredients on one side of the paper and drew the magic circle on the other. He would refrain from writing his visible text over it to ensure she had no issues replicating it.</p><p>Over the rest of the invisible ink, he wrote a response to her cover letter, mostly that he was impressed with their preparations for the Interduchy Tournament, that he was sure they would have many visitors looking for their new sweets, and that they would bring a few copies of the most popular Ehrenfest books to promote their products before the Archduke Conference.</p><p>He then sent it off and went immediately to Sylvester’s office.</p><p>One look at his face, and Sylvester knew to clear the room. After turning on the sound-blocking tool, he asked, “What is it this time?”</p><p>When Ferdinand told him about the king’s request, Sylvester held his head and cursed. He would refrain from mentioning Rozemyne’s plan until he confirmed whether or not she actually managed to obtain her Wisdom.</p><p> </p><p>All too soon, the day of the Interduchy Tournament came. Once again, Ferdinand was attending as a member of the archducal family, not the knight commander, so Karstedt was once again guarding Sylvester. When he arrived, the three archduke candidates were there to greet him.</p><p>They got the pleasantries out of the way, and then he went into the common room to check on their preparations while the three children waited for Sylvester and Florencia to teleport over. All of Rozemyne’s adult guard knights were present along with Hartmut. The former were working with the apprentice knights while the latter was marveling over Rozemyne’s graphs, causing those around him to roll their eyes as he restarted his sermon on her divinity.</p><p>Like last year, Ferdinand had Janrik work with the attendants, Justus with the scholars, and had Eckhart join him with the knights.</p><p>“You seem exceptionally fast this morning,” Ferdinand observed after watching their practice for a bit.</p><p>Leonore, their representative, saluted and said, “Yes, Knight Commander. Lady Charlotte led us in performing Dunkelfelger’s pre-ditter ritual yesterday. We have now adjusted to the boost from the blessing, but a beam of light also appeared near Dunkelfelger’s dorm, so it’s safe to say that they are also prepared.”</p><p>Ferdinand blinked at her. “Charlotte, you say?”</p><p>“Yes, Knight Commander. As Lord Wilfried will be participating with us since he’s also taking the knight course, Lady Rozemyne and Lord Wilfried asked Lady Charlotte to lead the ritual.”</p><p>So they were getting Charlotte to fill her tablets, were they? While Rozemyne had mentioned that her little sister would need to do the shrine tour after performing the divine protection ritual, she hadn’t shared this part of the plan.</p><p>“Very well,” he said, waving for her to return to her practice.</p><p>When he confronted Rozemyne about it, she simply stated that it was a foregone conclusion that they would be taking these measures for her. He pinched her cheek anyway.</p><p>Before long, they arrived at the arena. Once again, Sylvester was paired with Charlotte and Florencia with Wilfried, leaving Ferdinand with his fiancée. Dunkelfelger might be offended that Sylvester was still favoring his daughter for Aub, but the contract only said that Wilfried had to compete in good faith, not that Aub Ehrenfest had to be impartial. Such was the nature of hastily-written ditter contracts.</p><p>Ferdinand cast his gaze about the arena and saw Aub Ahrensbach and Lady Georgine eyeing them while Aub Dunkelfelger was toeing the line of his section, ready to sprint over to Ehrenfest. Technically, at least parts of the Ehrenfest archducal family should have been preparing to walk around as well since they were the Seventh, but with impending visitors, they would wait until later in the day to visit other duchies. Ferdinand was particularly interested in seeing how Ahrensbach’s research project with Rozemyne and Raimund had turned out and how Dunkelfelger’s findings differed this weave after introducing Wilfried as a variable.</p><p>The second the ditter tournament started, Aub Dunkelfelger moved as fast as his first wife would allow him, making him arrive around the same time as Aub Ahrensbach, Georgine, and Detlinde. As planned, the Ehrenfest archducal family converged on Sylvester to handle this delicate matter since every single one of them - save Florencia, perhaps - was involved.</p><p>Aub Ahrensbach looked displeased, but he could say nothing until Aub Dunkelfelger did.</p><p>They got the greetings out of the way before Aub Dunkelfelger saw his wife to a seat and took one himself. Hannelore, meanwhile, had to be physically prompted by her mother to sit. She had been frozen in wide-eyed shock. Wilfried was staring slack-jawed back at her.</p><p>Florencia quickly noticed what was going on and patted her son’s hand, bringing him out of his stupor.</p><p>Ferdinand sighed inwardly. Of course the boy would develop mana sensing when both his current and ex-fiancée’s were present to discuss their marriage woes. What terrible timing.</p><p>Rozemyne, meanwhile, was giving her brother a sympathetic look.</p><p>After the Ahrensbach crowd took their seats and tea and sweets had been served, Aub Dunkelfelger rested his forearm on the table and said, “So your son has valiantly won the hand of my treasured daughter in an immutable game of bride-taking ditter! To find a way to take her hand where even the Zent himself can’t protest! Is this not the work of Bluanfah holding hands with Angriff?”</p><p>Ferdinand silently thanked the aub for taking such a strong stance on this. Even if he wanted to, Aub Ahrensbach wouldn’t be able to speak out against the engagement.</p><p>Meanwhile, Wilfried and Hannelore were making eye contact and looking away as Geduldh’s noble color tinged their cheeks, giving credence to Aub Dunkelfelger’s words.</p><p>“Yes, it certainly seems to be,” Aub Ahrensbach said.</p><p>Georgine tittered next to him. “My, Brother, if you had but told us that your son delighted in spring for another when we first mentioned the union with our duchy’s heir, you could have saved us both this embarrassment.”</p><p>“I do apologize, Lady Georgine,” Sylvester said, “but as you will recall, I had no opportunity to speak with you before you took your request for my son’s engagement to the Zent. I’m afraid such hasty actions left Wilfried little choice if he wished to follow the guidance of Sterrat to tie his stars to his Goddess of Light.”</p><p>“Is that so?” Sieglinde asked. “I see. So all those rumors about you and your son were merely the result of Steifebrise overtaking Ordoschnelli. It is fortunate we are able to hear her message now.”</p><p>Detlinde huffed and said, “Are you sure he wasn’t forced into the match by that temple girl? He’d given me two blessings from the God of Darkness, you know.”</p><p>Wilfried’s and Hannelore’s glares were lethal.</p><p>Sieglinde frowned and turned to Georgine. “Ah, Lady Georgine, has Anhaltung abandoned Ahrensbach’s archducal family, or has your daughter yet to hear of the joint research between Dunkelfelger and Ehrenfest? Is it not because of the temple that the two older Ehrenfest archduke candidates enjoy so many divine protections? All three present, too, are able to summon the divine instruments. To continue to look down on the archduke candidates of Ehrenfest for their involvement in the temple is nothing short of Vantole playing at being Mestionora. Has Erwachlehren abandoned your house, as well?”</p><p>When Detlinde moved to speak, Georgine did her job for once and made her keep quiet.</p><p>Aub Ahrensbach held his hands open in a peaceful gesture. “Now, I believe people in their summer are like to seek Angriff when Bluanfah’s dance is cut short. It is not uncommon for those suffering from dying sprouts to be rendered deaf to Anhaltung. We merely need to seek Duldsetzen until it has passed.”</p><p>“Explain the blessings, then!” Detlinde demanded. How convenient that Georgine lost control of her at that moment.</p><p>“They were blessings from Verdraeos,” Wilfried said, leveling a cold look at his cousin. “Had you not been playing Chaocipher so convincingly, you would have received a yellow blessing from Jungereise instead.”</p><p>Ferdinand was impressed. He didn’t think the boy would have been capable of producing that response in the previous weave.</p><p>Florencia patted her son’s shoulder, a gesture that could be interpreted as admonishment or praise.</p><p>Detlinde huffed again, probably missing half of what Wilfried had said. “Well, I think it’s obvious what’s happening here. Lady Hannelore wouldn’t have acted so shamelessly if she weren’t so influenced by that temple flower.”</p><p>Fury burned in the eyes of everyone save those from Ahrensbach, though the aub had the decency to let a little chagrin show on his face. “Georgine,” he said in a low voice.</p><p>Georgine made the minimum effort to chastise her daughter and sent her on her way, having no more use for her. The brat was likely heading to the Ahrensbach research display to try to steal the stuffed schumil. Even now, Ferdinand still felt guilty for letting her take the toy from Rozemyne, and he resented Detlinde for it.</p><p>Sylvester, fully employing the gravitas of an aub from an upper-ranking duchy, turned his heavy gaze on Aub Ahrensbach and said, “It seems Grammaratur has also withdrawn her blessings from your house. That you would allow the one set to become archduchess, no matter how temporarily, to speak in such a way about my daughter leads me to believe Gebordnung has never even glimpsed your home.”</p><p>Ferdinand glanced at Aub Dunkelfelger and confirmed the man was quietly observing to see how Sylester would handle the situation. He did not seem disappointed thus far.</p><p>“Oh, but my dear little brother, I believe there’s been a misunderstanding. First, as my husband already stated, my daughter is suffering from losing Bluanfah’s blessing so soon before her graduation. Why, it was so shocking that she was bedridden for three days.”</p><p>More likely, they had summoned her back home to keep her from doing something foolish while they concocted their next plot.</p><p>“For another, she was not speaking of Lady Charlotte.”</p><p>Sylvester ignored Georgine, his eyes never leaving Aub Ahrensbach. “I will forgo dancing with Grammaratur, so forgive my bluntness. I merely wish to ensure Ordoschnelli arrives without losing her way. Rozemyne is my daughter. Speaking against her is no different than speaking against Charlotte.</p><p>“Now that I have made that clear, Aub Ahrensbach, how do you intend to address the insult not only to my daughter but to Aub Dunkelfelger’s daughter as well?”</p><p>Sieglinde and Aub Dunkelfelger both raised their brows in anticipation as they bore down on Aub Ahrensbach. Georgine’s polite smile was gone, but her eyes were calculating. The aub, however, seemed a little pale.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hannelore looked like she wanted the ground to swallow her, and Wilfried was the incarnation of Angriff as he glared at the Ahrensbach couple. Florencia and Charlotte, too, had dropped their smiles, but Rozemyne merely sat with an expectant look on her face, though her cheeks had the faintest hint of blush. Ferdinand could guess she was pleased with being included as a full member of the family.</p><p>Ferdinand himself had folded his hands in his lap and maintained a blank, stony expression as he recalled what he did to the last man who’d called his fiancée a flower. Georgine was already dead. The only question was whether Sylvester or Ferdinand would get to her first. Ferdinand hoped it would be him. He still remembered the look on Sylvester’s face as he talked about killing his sister, and he wanted to spare his older brother the pain if he could.</p><p>Aub Ahrensbach opened his hands in a pleading gesture and said, “I must offer my deepest apologies for my daughter’s vulgar speech. She will be thoroughly reprimanded upon our return to Ahrensbach.”</p><p>“And?” Aub Dunkelfelger asked.</p><p>Ferdinand had to bite the inside of his mouth to hide the smirk.</p><p>Now even Georgine looked a little concerned.</p><p>Unable to come up with an answer, Aub Ahrensbach asked, “What would you have me offer of equivalent value to the scorn my daughter showed yours?”</p><p>Sieglinde looked less than pleased with that response, but she said with a calm, level voice, “As you know, accusations like the one Lady Detline leveled at both my daughter and Lady Rozemyne, one of the pillars of support Hannelore will be counting on when she marries into Ehrenfest, can tarnish one’s reputation for life. I daresay that saying such a vile thing in front of all those present suggests she spreads these rumors freely among her peers where she benefits from no oversight. I shudder to think what damage she’s already wrought on both of their reputations.</p><p>“As such, I do not believe it unreasonable to ask you to lower the cost of sugar for both Dunkelfelger and Ehrenfest. Has it not been steadily rising these past two years? I believe a significant portion of the price is import taxes, which you should have no issue waving, yes?”</p><p>If Ferdinand had blinked, he would have missed it. While Aub Ahrensbach looked troubled, as one would expect, Georgine panicked for the briefest moment. He recalled one of the reports Justus sent him from when he was playing at being Traugott’s attendant, stating that the price of sugar was rumored to rise. He had briefly wondered if it was Lanzenave’s or Ahrensbach's doing. Judging by their reactions, it was plain to see Georgine was funding something.</p><p>But what was she using the money on? Was she engaging in human trafficking to give Lanzenave feystones, even if they were of inferior quality to what they received from Adalgisa? Was she simply buying more silver cloth and weapons? Whatever it was, he was certain it was an essential part of her plan to take Ehrenfest.</p><p>Ferdinand would need to give his amulet to Justus and have him skulk around for information. Someone must have seen something somewhere.</p><p>In the end, Dunkelfelger and Ehrenfest signed a contract that would cut what they had to pay for sugar by nearly a third. The financial benefit was immense, but the information Ferdinand had just obtained would undoubtedly prove even more so.</p><p>Once Ahrensbach fled, talk turned to plans for Ferdinand and Sylvester to go to Dunkelfelger’s tea party room that evening to watch the bride-taking ditter on the aub’s recording device. They talked a bit more about the terms of the contract, dodged any inquiries about Wilfried marrying into Dunkelfelger, discussed the joint research, and deflected any requests for ditter. Not even rare materials could coax Ferdinand onto the field. He didn’t want to build the expectation that he would play them every year.</p><p>Before they left, Aub Dunkelfelger personally delivered a book from his collection to Rozemyne, which made Ferdinand smirk. The gesture would demonstrate how much value Dunkelfelger put in her and help to silence any rumors Detlinde tried to spread.</p><p>The next visitor was Aub Drewanchel who wanted to discuss their joint research with Ferdinand and see about getting more plant paper to experiment with. While he happily discussed the research, he had to send the aub over to Sylvester and Charlotte to discuss business.</p><p>Naturally, as Ferdinand couldn’t go too long without experiencing a headache-inducing conversation, Prince Anastasius arrived. Just as he was sitting down, however, an ordonnanz from Fraularm alighted on Rozemyne’s outstretched arm, screeching at her for sabotaging them by recording an advertisement for Ehrenfest books on the device inside the stuffed shumil. That brought a smile to Ferdinand’s face. He’d forgotten just how proud he’d felt of Rozemyne when that happened in the previous weave.</p><p>The prince shook his head and erected a sound barrier. “I thought you said you didn’t care if they took the credit,” he said.</p><p>Rozemyne shrugged. “I don’t, but since Raimund left me in charge of the recordings, I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to advertise our duchy’s main industry.”</p><p>That made him smirk for a brief moment before he became serious again. “I trust Rozemyne has already told you of the summons that will be coming later this evening?” he asked, looking at Ferdinand.</p><p>“Yes, we serve at the pleasure of the Zent.”</p><p>The prince rested his nose against his laced fingers to hide his mouth, “Rozemyne, Lord Ferdinand, allow me to dispense with Grammaratur’s dance. This business with the bride-taking ditter has left a bad taste in the Zent’s mouth. While he is more inclined to let it go as the passions of youth given how his third marriage came about, he will still be watching Ehrenfest closely. Rozemyne, you must not do anything that will even hint that you are aligned with the biblical fundamentalists. In fact, emphasize your connection with Ehrenfest. Be as embarrassingly verbose about how you delight in spring as you were at our first meeting.”</p><p>Ferdinand’s eyes narrowed as he picked up his teacup. “What danger are you attempting to shield us from?”</p><p>He held Ferdinand’s gaze for a long moment before he said, “Sigiswald is pushing for Rozemyne to be the Sovereign High Bishop.”</p><p>“And just where did he get this idea from?”</p><p>“I think we both know the answer, though I have no proof. I can confirm he is not under the influence of the substance we discussed. My father has dismissed his suggestion, but given her ability to wield multiple divine instruments, Rozemyne’s part in leading the joint research that will bring more divine protections to Yurgenschmidt, her devotion to studying rituals, her vast mana quantity that allows her to generously heal and protect even those outside her duchy, and her ability to give magnificent blessings, it is not difficult to see how someone could turn the narrative.”</p><p>“And what of the other archduke candidates that have demonstrated the same or similar?”</p><p>Anastasius sighed. “They aren’t High Bishop of their duchy’s temple. That is the only difference I can see.”</p><p>Rozemyne lifted her own teacup, causing Ferdinand’s heart rate to spike. “If I may offer a suggestion…”</p><p>“Please,” Anastasius said. The look in his eye suggested they’d shared this sort of conversation on multiple occasions, and he did not find them offensive. Ferdinand mentally reviewed the letters he’d received about her meetings with the prince, but was there anything that implied they had built this sort of rapport with each other? Had statements like, “Prince Anastasius ruined the mood,” been more playful than reprimanding? Rozemyne had done things that made Ferdinand worried she was enticing the prince, but this atmosphere felt more like a meeting of two comrades than someone pining for a Goddess of Light.</p><p>After taking a delicate sip of her tea, Rozemyne said, “Have you looked into those around you who have had the opportunity to make contact with Ahrensbach? For instance, have you sent scholars, knights, or other such personnel to their duchy? Have any returned multiple times or seemed to stay a bit too long?”</p><p>Anastasius shook his head. “We checked them all when they returned. None had been influenced by the substance.”</p><p>“But could they not have been influenced in other ways? They might have even been given this substance to employ rather than fall victim to.”</p><p>The prince’s eyes widened just slightly. “I’ll consider it.”</p><p>“If I might add a further suggestion?”</p><p>He nodded for her to continue, and Ferdinand had to fight the impulse to kick her leg to get her to stop talking. She’d met with the prince enough times on her own that she knew better than Ferdinand what could and could not be said.</p><p>“I do not know what this substance is that you speak of, but I do recall you once asked me about something that smells sweet when burned. Were I in your situation, I would ensure I did not use anything fragrant like incense, perfumes, or the like. Even things like flowers or strong-smelling foods.”</p><p>His eyes widened noticeably this time. Ferdinand wondered how many royals were about to get waschened. “Our discussion has proven as fruitful as ever,” he said. “I do not have much time, so I must cut this conversation short if I’m to meet with Aub Ehrenfest for appearance’s sake.”</p><p>Rozemyne dipped her head in a slight bow. “I thank you ever so much for your consideration.”</p><p>With that, the prince went to Sylvester’s table. Unlike last weave, his brother didn’t panic or look uncomfortable. Instead, he sat straight with his shoulders back and his eyes clear, speaking with Anastasius as one would expect from an upper-ranking archduke. Ferdinand didn’t think he would ever feel as proud of Sylvester as he did right then.</p><p>Just when had his older brother grown up?</p><p> </p><p>After lunch, Ferdinand escorted Rozemyne around the arena as they looked at the other duchies’ research and sweets. Drewanchel’s part of the joint research was as fascinating as last time, though Charlotte had better guarded Rozemyne’s ideas, so the “music box” she’d suggested was on display at Ehrenfest’s tables. The moveable books with nanseb paper had yet to be realized, so Charlotte had put that idea away for next year’s research projects.</p><p>This was Ferdinand’s first time getting to see Dunkelfelger’s side of the research since Detlinde hadn’t wanted to stay long enough for him to even glimpse it. They had benefited greatly from Rozemyne’s questionnaire strategy, and their results were fascinating. That such dedication to ditter would lead to such staggering results for obtaining blessings… He could scarcely imagine what Drewanchel or Klassenberg would achieve with their hyperfocus on research and art.</p><p>He visited Ahrensbach’s stand partly to see the annoyed look on Fraularm’s face and partly to check in with his disciple. Given relations between the duchies, they were still discouraging him from approaching Ehrenfest, but he would come of age a year before Rozemyne, so it wouldn’t be too much longer before he’d be one of Ferdinand’s retainers. It truly was a shame he couldn’t give him the mana compression method before then, but it would still have some effect even after his growth period ended.</p><p>Just to tweak Fraularm’s nerves, Ferdinand played through all the recordings on the shumil and congratulated both of his disciples for their hard work.</p><p>They returned in time to watch Ehrenfest play ditter, and after having done the pre-ditter ritual, they outdid every previous showing by far. The entire duchy waited for the awards ceremony with bated breath.</p><p>When it came time for the students to descend to their places, Rozemyne turned to Ferdinand and said, “I’m glad you’re here.”</p><p>He gave her a small smile, also glad that he wasn’t sitting with Ahrensbach. “Go on,” he said. “I’ll be waiting here when you return.”</p><p>With a nod, she turned and ran over to her siblings who’d been waiting for her, and together, they flew down.</p><p>The royal family filed in, and after the king gave the same opening speech he did every year, they began to announce the ditter winners. First place, unsurprisingly, was Dunkelfelger. With their blessings, they had utterly destroyed their feybeast within moments. Second place was Ehrenfest.</p><p>Even Ferdinand was shocked. They’d placed third in the last weave, but perhaps the shuffling of instructors had worked against Klassenberg this time. Their feybeast had been simple to defeat then, but Ferdinand wasn’t sure what they fought against this time since he’d been escorting Rozemyne between research presentations during their match.</p><p>Even so, Ferdiand never imagined Ehrenfest would rank so high, but he had increased the difficulty of their training, and they had Wilfried with them now. The boy had been practicing enhancement magic since Rozemyne first went in her jureve, and he’d been compressing his mana enough to make himself sick on multiple occasions in the past year. His presence alone was the counterweight to Lestilaut’s in Dunkelfelger.</p><p>And Lestilaut was graduating, meaning if they worked hard enough and got more children from the former Veronica faction to sign the more restrictive contract to learn Rozemyne’s compression method, then they could sweep the tournament. They would be losing Leonore, but Matthias was an excellent strategist as well, and Wilfried was coming into his own as future knight commander.</p><p>Next came research presentations. The places were the same as last weave, Dunkelfelger and Ehrenfest’s joint research on rituals and divine protections, Gilessenmeyer’s research on mana-amplifying magic tools, and Ahrensbach and Ehrenfest’s joint research on mana-efficient tools. What was different, however, was that Rozemyne managed to convince Wilfried to represent them for Dunkelfelger, and Raimund was allowed to represent Ahrensbach. Ferdinand could only assume Georgine had forced Detlinde to sit this one out. The thought alone brought a smile to his face.</p><p>As integral as Rozemyne was to Dunkelfelger’s research, he was glad she had gotten her brother to agree to share the glory this time. It not only furthered their plan to make Rozemyne less singular, it also prevented her from being escorted across the stage by Lestilaut.</p><p>Even if the boy hadn’t become enamored with her this weave, Ferdinand would never forget that painting.</p><p>Of course, Wilfried had also played a bigger role in the research this weave, too, having done the pre-ditter ritual and participated in the follow-up game of speed ditter. He also helped with the Dedication Ritual as a blue priest. It was…surprisingly nice to see his hard work get recognized, even if he seemed embarrassed by receiving so much praise from the head scholar.</p><p>It was equally rewarding to see Raimund get recognized for all his efforts in reducing mana expenditure, something Ferdinand had never personally considered before seeing his work. He’d been somewhat curled in on himself when he first ascended the stage, but Rozemyne spoke a few words to him, and he straightened right up. He could well imagine what she’d said.</p><p>
<em>”Ferdinand’s watching you.”</em>
</p><p>Once the awards were distributed, the awards for most visitors were announced. Unsurprisingly, Ehrenfest didn’t place. Regardless of how popular their trends were, they simply didn’t have the manpower to match the top three duchies.</p><p>The individual awards were next. Ehrenfest had even more students than last weave receive honors, and like last time, Rozemyne took first in class overall, for the archduke course, and for the scholar course. Surprisingly, however, Wilfried took first in class for the knight course, and Charlotte took first in class for the second years. Sylvester laughed and slapped Ferdinand on the back. “My kids swept the board!” he cried. “Florencia! Did you see that?!”</p><p>Her smile was peaceful, but her eyes were dancing. “I did. We should be very proud of them.”</p><p>Karstedt was grinning to himself while Elvira covered her mouth to hide her wide smile. For once, her stylus was not flying across her diptych.</p><p>Wilfried escorted Rozemyne to the stage and muttered something to her. She nodded and walked forward, her head held high and her smile carefully polite. As she knelt before the king, he praised her not only for her grades for the past three years but also her work on three joint research projects.</p><p>With her grin broadening, she said, “It is my greatest honor to have aided the Zent.” When she stood and turned to the audience, her face was glowing, and once again when her eyes landed on Ferdinand, her smile became dazzling.</p><p>He realized with a jolt of panic that the expression she wore was going to kill him when she was older.</p><p>Wilfried and Charlotte, too, were walking on air after receiving their praise. Hannelore, who’d been named an honor student, flushed red as Wilfried shot her a smile when he passed by. Every moment of the exchange was undoubtedly being recorded in Elvira’s diptych.</p><p>Sylvester, however, had his attention drawn elsewhere. “Hey, wait a second,” he said. “Did you see how that Drewanchel boy looked at Charlotte when she smiled at him? Ah! And Lestilaut! Is it just me, or is his mouth hanging open?!”</p><p>Ferdinand snorted. “It’s definitely open.”</p><p>“It’s a good thing he’s graduating because that’s the face of a troublemaker right there.”</p><p>“You would know.”</p><p>Sylvester put his arm around Ferdinand’s shoulders and said, “Well, I had to earn that blessing from Beischmacht somehow.”</p><p>Ferdinand shrugged him off with a disgusted scoff. “Could you stop bragging about that?”</p><p>“It’s okay to be jealous, but don’t worry. Maybe you’ll earn his blessing some day, eh?”</p><p>Ferdinand leveled a look at his brother.</p><p>Eventually, Sylvester figured out who he would be earning that blessing with, and the face he made filled Ferdinand with smug satisfaction. He’d never have to hear his brother boast about that shameless blessing again.</p><p>When they got back to the dormitory, Sylvester immediately started bragging to everyone about his children while Charlotte sighed with resignation and Wilfried held a hand over his eyes as though not being able to see his father would make him stop talking.</p><p>Rozemyne, however, was eating it up. At least, until Sylvester pushed his finger into her cheek and said, “And you, little missy! Taking three first-in-class awards in one go! Like teacher like disciple, eh? Not bad for a little shumil!”</p><p>At his incessant prodding she glared at him and spat, “Poohey!”</p><p>Sylvester laughed and patted her head. “Good job, kid! We’re proud of you, aren’t we?”</p><p>The room burst into cheers, and if she had been in her old body, Ferdinand was certain Rozemyne would have passed out. Florencia congratulated her, too, before she went to talk with Charlotte. As Rozemyne went to speak with the Linkbergs, Wilfried walked over and said, “Uncle! I got first in class in the knight course!”</p><p>“So you did,” Ferdinand said. “As one would expect of a knight commander. Well done.”</p><p>He broke into a broad grin before Sylvester came over and threw an arm around Wilfried’s shoulders. “Congratulations, son!”</p><p>“Thank you, Father!” he replied, his face lighting up.</p><p>“So,” Sylvester said, “about that dazed look you get whenever someone mentions a certain Lady Hannelore…”</p><p>The boy’s eyes widened in horror, and his cheeks turned pink as he dipped below Sylvester’s arm and used physical enhancement to bolt up the stairs.</p><p>Sylvester stared after him for a moment before he leaned over and asked Ferdinand, “You, uh, you don’t think…?”</p><p>“Sylvester, he’s twelve.”</p><p>“Yeah, I know, just with Detlinde earlier and all…”</p><p>Ferdinand bit his tongue to stop himself from saying what he thought of that little harlot.</p><p>About that time, Rozemyne came bounding over. “Ferdinand! Ferdinand! I got first in class three times today! And I got praised for my joint research projects! I did great, right? Praise me! Praise me!”</p><p>Sylvester turned away to hide his poorly-concealed laughter as Ferdinand chuckled and said, “Yes, well done. Very fine work indeed.”</p><p>He’d praise her properly once they were at the temple again.</p><p> </p><p>The Dunkelfelger tea room was a nightmare. He was immediately swarmed upon entering with Heisshitze bouncing around at the front of the gaggle. His every step was impeded as he tried to walk to where the recording device was set up. He somehow made it to Aub Dunkelfelger, though he had to threaten half a dozen men with ripping their arms off if they slapped his back one more time. It seemed none of them realized how serious he was.</p><p>“FERDINAND!” the aub bellowed. “Come! Sit! Watch the majesty of the finest game of ditter ever recorded! Aub Ehrenfest, your children are something else! Something else indeed! Never in my days have I even heard of someone bringing divine instruments onto the field, and in this one game we saw no less than five! Five! Come, it’s not enough to hear about it! Heisshitze, let’s watch ditter!”</p><p>“Yes, Aub!” he yelled as he ran to activate the magic tool.</p><p>At last, Ferdinand was free of the man for a precious few moments.</p><p>As the recording began, Ferdinand found himself leaning forward, captivated by Rozemyne’s proud stance as she stood between Charlotte and the Dunkelfelger knights. The fact that she’d recognized the blinding magic tool impressed him. The large-scale waschen caused an uproar, yet Ferdinand could still somehow hear Clarissa claiming credit for the research behind the enhancement magic circle. When Rozemyne began spinning Verfuhremeer’s staff, Aub Dunkelfelger pointed and yelled, “Behold, the first of your fiancée’s many feats! That staff has been passed down through the Dunkelfelger archducal family since time immemorial, and she sees it one time and look at what she does!”</p><p>“Saint of Evil!” several of the knights yelled, making Sylvester nearly choke on the vize he’d been sipping. Ferdinand glanced over his shoulder to see Eckhart nodding along proudly, Justus bracing himself against the wall as he laughed, and Janrik staring at the recording in utter bemusement. Ferdinand wondered how many times the young man had questioned his decision to swear his name to him.</p><p>“And look there!” Heisshitze cried. “Have you ever seen such horrifying magic tools?! The size of those thorns! It was only Leidenschaft’s own protection that kept any of our young knights from losing an eye!”</p><p>“Saint of Evil!” the knights yelled again.</p><p>When Rozemyne used her water gun to take their strongest knight out with a single shot, Ferdinand smirked, earning him several pats on the back from the men around him. Then, when she’d ordered her guards to destroy Dunkelfelger’s supplies, he broke into a dark grin. Sylvester, however, joined the rest of the men in chanting Rozemyne’s new nickname.</p><p>Sylvester stopped and leapt to his feet with several of the other knights, though, when Wilfried began charging Ewigeliebe’s sword. Aub Dunkelfelger’s laughter echoed around the room as he yelled, “Yes! Yes! The third divine instrument takes the field! And look how hard your side fought even though they were mostly mednobles! Ah! There it is! The swing! Look at all those feybeasts! Have you ever seen such a sight on the ditter field?!”</p><p>As Lestilaut charged towards Charlotte, one of the knights grabbed Ferdinand’s shoulder and pointed at the magic tool. “Look! Watch the Saint of Evil! She’s walking out of the shield and… THERE! THERE IT IS!” The knight let go and started celebrating with the men around him as others cheered at the sight of Leidenschaft’s spear crackling with energy. After Lestilaut blocked Rozemyne’s attack and fell into Charlotte’s shield, Wilfried flew towards Hannelore. Moments later, a bright flash covered half of Ehrenfest’s side of the field, and the black shield turned into gold dust to the uproarious applause of the very people who were now lacking one of their great treasures.</p><p>“Wait! Wait!” one of the knights yelled. “And… THERE IT IS! The Saint of Evil’s nefarious trick to bind Lord Lestilaut! Lord Ferdinand! What was it?! What was it?!”</p><p>He scoffed. “Only a fool reveals the secrets behind his schemes.” Inwardly, he was thanking every god with ears, even Mestionora, that they believed that nonsense.</p><p>“Look!” the aub bellowed. “Lord Wilfried is about to debut the final divine instrument! You see my Hannelore? You see what she’s grasping? All the apprentice knights thought it was merely a courtship necklace, but watch! Just watch!” The temporary Schutzaria’s shield went up around her, and several of the men cried out various versions of, “Why don’t <em>we</em> have a shield charm like that?!”</p><p>When Wilfried produced the God of Darkness’ cape and captured Hannelore, the knights went wild.</p><p>When Hannelore kissed Wilfried, the room exploded with cheers and mixed cries of, “That’s our girl!” and “He got the real Dunkelfelger treatment!” and “Why can’t I find someone?! He’s only twelve!”</p><p>For a moment, Ferdinand thought Damuel was among them.</p><p>After Sylvester recovered from his shock enough to speak, he leaned over and said in Ferdinand’s ear, “I think Wilfried’s going to get Beischmacht’s blessing long before you do.”</p>

</h3>

<h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
<p>The morning of the graduation ceremony, everyone who would be accompanying the three archduke candidates had gathered in the tea party room to go over final details. Leonore, Alexis, and Lieseleta were graduating, and Cornelius and Matthias were acting as escorts, so they would not be joining. They also couldn’t afford to take too many “blue priests,” so they were limited to only their archknights and a single medknight each. Even if they could get away with taking all their guards, they didn’t have enough robes of adequate size to fit them all.</p><p>The Sovereign Temple was handling the morning ceremony with the Sword Dance and Dedication Whirl, and the Ehrenfest archduke candidates would be performing the actual graduation ceremony. Sylvester had met with the king right before viewing the ditter match, and they’d agreed that the situation would be explained to the audience and that all three of them would be responsible for giving the blessing to better emphasize not only the importance of religious ceremonies but also that multiple people would benefit from taking them seriously. While Ferdinand did not like the idea of making Ehrenfest stand out so much, they already were even without this request from the king.</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne,” Rihyarda said, “it’s time.”</p><p>“Right!” she said, clapping her hands. “Then we’ll reconvene during lunch.” Ferdinand escorted her out to the common room where she immediately left his side to go talk to her graduating retainers and their escorts, congratulating them, commenting on their formal attire, and praising Cornelius and Matthias for their selection of hair ornaments for the women they were escorting. Meanwhile, Wilfried was talking excitedly with Alexis about the upcoming sword dance.</p><p>Before long, everyone started filing out, and then Ferdinand escorted Rozemyne to the hall where they sat near the front with the archducal family. Just before the sword dance began, he noticed Rozemyne passing Wilfried a sound-blocking tool. His eyebrow twitched with annoyance until he realized they were arguing over whose guard knight was better - Alexis or Leonore. At least they did it with noble smiles on their faces, no matter how heated their eyes got.</p><p>When the dance ended, preparations were made for the dedication whirl. He looked over to the graduating students and frowned, remembering having to escort that abomination in the last weave. It looked like they’d found an older cousin or some such to victimize this time, though at least the man didn’t have to be seen with a towering monstrosity of hair and ribbons. To think Ferdinand had thought he couldn’t be any more embarrassed only to be proven wrong moments later when Detlinde toppled over on stage and threw the entire country into chaos.</p><p>Thankfully, the dance finished without incident, and they headed back to the dormitory for lunch. After a hasty meal, the children and their guards went to get changed into their robes. This time, they would be going ahead of their guardians. Before they left, Ferdinand beckoned Rozemyne to step to the side with him. He leaned down and said, “Be careful, Rozemyne.”</p><p>She nodded. “I will.”</p><p>They maintained eye contact through a lengthy silent exchange before she was called back over to the group. Ferdinand’s heart leapt to his throat as he watched her walk away and disappear into the hall. Whatever their enemies were planning, Rozemyne was beyond his reach now. He wouldn’t be there to protect her.</p><p>He waited impatiently until the archducal family at last could leave for the ceremony. When they arrived, the hall was abuzz with whispers. Where the representatives from the Sovereign Temple normally stood were Rozemyne, holding Ehrenfest’s bible, Wilfried, and Charlotte flanked by their guard knights in blue robes. It made quite the spectacle to say the least. When those already seated noticed Aub Ehrenfest had arrived, the murmurs increased. Ferdinand’s enhanced hearing picked up phrases like, “Is he really okay with this?” and “I thought he was sending his adopted daughter to the Sovereign Temple, but if they’re all down there…” and “Is this part of the divine protections research, maybe?”</p><p>Sylvester and Florencia acted as though they didn’t hear a word, stopping to greet Aubs Dunkelfelger and Drewanchel as they headed to their seats. Several aubs from lower-ranking duchies came to offer their greetings directly to Sylvester and Florencia before finding their seats as well. It seemed despite Gerogine’s efforts, the general perception of Ehrenfest was at least somewhat positive. Of course, having such a strong connection to Dunkelfelger didn’t hurt.</p><p>Normally, the High Bishop would begin the ceremony, but instead, Zent Trauerqual took the stage with a sound-amplifying magic tool, causing an excited hush to fall over the audience. He gave greetings then said, “This year, joint research between Dunkelfelger and Ehrenfest revealed the significance of religious rituals and the part they play in obtaining divine protections. Even we of the royal family participated in a Dedication Ritual held here at the Academy as part of the research. In order to celebrate this discovery and demonstrate to all present the power of sincere prayer and mana dedication to the gods, the archduke candidates of Ehrenfest, each of them members of their temple, will perform this year’s blessing for our graduating nobles.”</p><p>Ferdinand looked to the rest of the royal family. Sigiswald had a serene smile on his face as always, so either he wasn’t planning anything deeper than what was shared or he didn’t realize his plan had just fallen to shambles. Anastasius looked the same as ever, but Ferdinand noticed the prince and Rozemyne made eye contact, and something subtle passed between the two. It seemed she was thanking him, meaning the content of the explanation was likely the prince’s doing.</p><p>No one in the Sovereign Knight’s Order gave anything away, but the Sovereign High Bishop seemed less than pleased. The Sovereign High Priest, however, had a hunger in his eyes that made him an instant target for elimination. The way Hartmut was subtly shifted to block as much of Rozemyne as possible from his view suggested he’d noticed the worm’s intentions as well.</p><p>From the corner of his eye, Ferdinand looked towards Aub Ahrensbach. He seemed nonplussed, but Georgine’s gaze was hard as she focused on the Ehrenfest archduke candidates. Ferdinand didn’t know which she was targeting or if it was all of them, but he could tell she was scheming something. Was she preparing to switch tactics now that the plot to make Rozemyne Sovereign High Bishop was failing, or was she going to double down?</p><p>He didn’t have long to ponder it as the king went back to his seat, ceding the floor to Rozemyne, Wilfried, and Charlotte. Hartmut stepped forward and rang the bell staff, calling forth the graduates. They entered the hall as their names were called, and Rozemyne, as High Bishop, gave each of them the traditional words that bade them to keep dedicating themselves to the gods so that the land might grow fruitful and prosper. Normally, the called graduates would kneel, receive the “blessing,” and then leave, but as they would receive real blessings this time, they instead moved to seating that had been arranged around the base of the white stairway Rozemyne and the others were standing on. Once all of them were seated, Hartmut called for them to kneel. Once they did, Rozemyne looked to her siblings, and they stepped forward next to her. In one voice, they prayed to the gods and offered to the graduating adults true blessings.</p><p>Ferdinand closed his eyes and fought back a groan as the audience and graduates alike gasped and cried out in awe. He had been <em>very</em> clear that they were to give the minimum amount required to bless the new adults. However, it seemed they interpreted that to mean they <em>each</em> had to give the minimum amount. The ceiling roiled with mana from the three archduke candidates before it burst into shimmering lights in a rainbow of colors that rained down over the graduates. More concerningly, however, the divine instruments on the stairs above them began to glow, and small beams of light shot out from them, each in the divine color of the god they represented.</p><p>Well, if Rozemyne hadn’t gotten her Wisdom already, the circle was likely filled now, or close to it. Maybe some of those lights went to Charlotte’s tablets, too.</p><p>“F-Ferdinand?” Sylvester asked.</p><p>He shook his head. “No, I didn’t know.”</p><p>Even so, he should have known. This was <em>Rozemyne</em>, after all. It was only natural that what was meant as a “simple blessing” would turn into some headache-inducing event.</p><p>The hall was in an uproar. Most of those around Ferdinand seemed to be questioning if this was what the graduation ceremony was meant to be all along and if prayer and mana donation really was all that was required to produce such results. There were some calling for Rozemyne to be moved to the Sovereign Temple, but they were quickly shouted down by others saying archduke candidates couldn’t be moved or that if they took her they would have to take all three because it was impossible for most to tell whose blessing was whose, meaning they couldn’t definitively say that Rozemyne’s was the largest.</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger wasn’t helping matters. He was proclaiming the excellence of his future son-in-law and telling those around him about the divine instruments the three Ehrenfest archduke candidates wielded during their ditter match.</p><p>Ferdinand thought he could hear Fraularm screeching something about trickery, but he quickly dismissed her just like he was sure most people were doing.</p><p>The Sovereign High Bishop was staring in shock while the High Priest was giving Rozemyne a calculating look. Hartmut was giving him a smile sharp enough to cut the man in two.</p><p>Meanwhile, Sigiswald was blinking in disbelief, his mouth hanging slightly open while Anastasius sat with his arms crossed, his finger tapping against his bicep. The king stood and went to stand in front of Rozemyne, Charlotte, and Wilfried, all of whom knelt with their arms crossed over their chests, their expressions calm as though this were an everyday occurrence.</p><p>Silence fell over the crowd, and Zent Trauerqual raised the voice-amplifying magic tool to his lips. “You have now seen for yourselves the significance of religious rituals. In Ehrenfest, the archducal family even prays when filling the foundation. The prayer is the same as the one given during the Dedication Whirl. As Zent, I ask those of you who are suppliers for your foundations to follow the example of Ehrenfest.”</p><p>Attention shifted back and forth from the king to Sylvester. To his credit, Sylvester only paled slightly, but he kept his face calm as he, Ferdinand, and Florencia all bowed towards him in a show of gratitude.</p><p>Ferdinand didn’t know if this recognition would prove helpful or detrimental. Would it make it harder or easier for them to take Rozemyne? Would their enemies try to target one of her siblings instead? How would this affect the way other duchies perceived them given their neutral status during the war? More importantly, how would this affect Georgine’s and Raublut’s movements going forward?</p><p> </p><p>The next morning, Charlotte convinced Sylvester to go to the underground archive with her to look for information on Haldenzel’s ritual. When he turned around to invite Rozemyne, Ferdinand shook his head, causing him to swallow his words. He then escorted his younger daughter from the dormitory, their entourages following behind.</p><p>“I believe I shall head to Professor Hirschur‘s lab,” Ferdinand said. “I have a few matters to discuss with her.”</p><p>“I’ll come with you!” Rozemyne announced. “I wanted to ask her some questions about my library tool research, anyway.”</p><p>Ferdinand tapped his temple and sighed, looking troubled. “Rozemyne, everyone is trying to prepare to return to Ehrenfest. Do not trouble your retainers.”</p><p>“My lady,” Laurenz said, “my preparations are complete, as are Matthias’ and Gretia’s.”</p><p>Rozemyne gave Ferdinand a pleading look.</p><p>“Very well,” he sighed. “Justus, Eckhart, with me. Janrik, continue preparations to depart.”</p><p>“Lord Ferdinand, is that not too few retainers?” Rihyarda asked, stopping her work momentarily.</p><p>He frowned at her then said, “We shall bring Damuel and Roderick along as well, but Professor Hirschur’s lab cannot hold many more. That will have to be satisfactory.”</p><p>After they went into the hall, Ferdinand muttered to Damuel, “Let us know when there is no one else who might observe us.”</p><p>The knight gulped and nodded, focusing on their surroundings. They walked at a leisurely pace towards the scholar building, and it was shortly before they arrived at Hirschur’s lab when Damuel gave the all clear.</p><p>Rozemyne dropped her hand from Ferdinand’s arm and said, “I’ll be off. Remember, everyone, you are not to speak a word of this to anyone.” Their retainers nodded, and then she vanished from sight.</p><p>Ferdinand continued to Hirschur’s lab where he engaged in talks of creating their own shumils as he waited for his fiancée to return.</p><p>She had told him of the plan after they’d returned from the graduation ceremony. While she had obtained all the tablets, she’d yet to fill the circle since she could not enter the Farthest Hall. However, after the display yesterday, she’d confirmed the circle was filled, so she wanted to go to the library this morning when it would be mostly empty. They’d then quickly devised this little ruse to get her out of the dormitory.</p><p>He’d warned her several times over to have Erwaermen ensure she returned to the library within moments of her departure. They would run into more than a few issues if she disappeared for another season again. She vividly recalled gaining her portion of Ferdinand’s Wisdom in the previous weave, so she knew what problems would arise without gaining the gods’ cooperation.</p><p>For the first time in his life, time crawled by as he discussed research with his old mentor. The more he tried to lose himself in it, the more he kept checking the sunlight coming through the window to see how long it’d been since he last checked. Eventually, Justus and Gretia left momentarily and returned with a tea cart in order to serve them a light lunch.</p><p>As he bit into his sandwich and reviewed a document on the hidden parts of the shumils’ magic circles, he tried to recall how long he’d been with the tree most recently. He had only been receiving what remained of his book, however, and he didn’t know what part Dregarnuhr played in determining when he returned from the Garden of Beginnings. Of course, these were also the same gods who said he’d wake up a year after Rozemyne’s baptism only to drop him in the middle of a critical point two seasons after the promised time. Either they were capricious, blind, or both.</p><p>It was late in the afternoon when Justus finally announced that they needed to return to the dormitory to finish preparations to depart in the morning. Ferdinand fought the urge to sigh with relief and bade his mentor farewell. She stopped him and asked, “Tell me, Ferdinand, what has been distracting you all day?”</p><p>He sighed and tapped his temple. Of course she would notice. “The graduation ceremony yesterday. Our archduke candidates made quite the spectacle of themselves, and I can’t help but wonder what repercussions that might cause.”</p><p>“Hmm, yes, it was quite the sight, wasn’t it? If I hear anything of note, I’ll inform you.”</p><p>“I would greatly appreciate it.”</p><p>Once Ferdinand left, he walked down the hall for a bit before Damuel coughed. Suddenly, Rozemyne appeared and wrapped her hand around Ferdinand’s proffered arm. “Success,” she said.</p><p>He nodded in response.</p><p>When they arrived at the dormitory, Sylvester greeted them with an excited, “We found it! The information on the stages!”</p><p>“Congratulations,” Ferdinand said as Rozemyne rushed forward to ask Charlotte about what she’d read in the underground archive. “That should appease some of the giebes. Will we return after dinner, then?”</p><p>Sylvester nodded. “Yeah, and I’ll make the announcement then.”</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>Dinner was a lively affair with excited chatter filling the common room with an annoying buzz. After the past two days, Ferdinand desired nothing more than silence and perhaps a dark room to lie down in. Still, Rozemyne beside him was all smiles as she joined the conversations around them, so some small part of his annoyance was soothed at least.</p><p>Towards the end of the meal, Sylvester got everyone’s attention and said, “As you know, we remaining adults will be leaving directly after dinner. Before I go, I must ask that all of you stay in the dormitory until it is time for you to return to Ehrenfest. You may entertain visitors in these last few days at the Academy, but after the events at the graduation ceremony yesterday, we need to move with caution. I have no doubt that students from Ehrenfest, especially our archduke candidates, will be targeted for various reasons.</p><p>“All of you, if anyone asks you about trade slots, availability of products, or the like, do the same as last year and say I will make those decisions at the Archduke Conference. If anyone asks about conducting joint research, say you can discuss it next term. However, if you’re approached about research into religious ceremonies, especially if you’re being probed about conducting them, say that will need to be discussed at the Archduke Conference. Understand?”</p><p>Rozemyne tilted her head and looked at Ferdinand, who sighed and passed her a sound-blocking tool. “So in other words, he’s trying to block us from making any commitments with Klassenberg and taking on the burden of providing anything for further Dedication Rituals?” she asked.</p><p>Ferdinand nodded.</p><p>“Why not suggest they perform a Dedication Ritual at the Archduke Conference if the royal family just wants more mana?” Her voice was slightly bitter, likely recalling the ritual being performed in the previous weave.</p><p>“Sylvester may suggest it, though I imagine the Sovereign High Bishop will find it exceedingly difficult to lead a Dedication Ritual with so many high-manaed nobles.”</p><p>“That sounds like his problem, not ours.”</p><p>Ferdinand looked at her, his brows raised. Was this girl who was refusing to stick her nose in something troublesome truly Rozemyne?</p><p>“What?” she asked. “Even I have limits.”</p><p>“So it seems.”</p><p>“Alright,” Sylvester said, bringing Ferdinand’s attention back to him. “If that’s it for questions, let’s finish our meal so we can depart before it gets too late.”</p><p>As they were getting ready to leave, Rozemyne pulled at Ferdinand’s sleeve, her eyes full of worry and her noble smile tight.</p><p>“What is it?” he asked.</p><p>“Um… When will we be able to…talk?” she muttered, her eyes darting around to make sure no one was listening.</p><p>He sighed and tapped at his temple. “You’ll need to go back to the temple after you return to verify everything was properly put back in place after the Dedication Ritual and graduation ceremony here at the Academy, yes?”</p><p>Her eyes lit up as she nodded. “Right. I’ll need to check on the bible as well.”</p><p>“Oh, what’s this?” Sylvester asked, sidling over to Ferdinand.</p><p>Before he could even begin any teasing, Rozemyne smiled at him and said, “Sylvester, did you know Lady Hannelore is coming tomorrow to visit Wilfried. <em>After</em> you’ll no longer be here?”</p><p>“Oh, is she now?” he said, his eyes alight with mischief as he pranced across the room to go bother his son.</p><p>“Well done.”</p><p>“I thank you ever so much.”</p><p>Ferdinand gave her a smirk and said, “I’ll see you when you return.” Then, they parted ways.</p><p> </p><p>A couple of days later, everyone was waiting in the teleportation room when Wilfried arrived. He greeted everyone, suddenly determined he had very little time to talk to his father, and rushed to the side of the room with his entourage surrounding him as he waited for Rozemyne to appear. He’d severely miscalculated his escape route, however. Since Lamprecht was among those guarding him, he’d left himself open to be flanked by Elvira. By the time Rozemyne teleported in, his shoulders were hunched, his head was in his hands, and his face was completely painted in Geduldh’s noble color.</p><p>Fortunately for him, Rozemyne’s arrival drew Elvira’s attention away. Bonifatius boomed, “There’s my adorable granddaughter!” as he began to charge towards her.</p><p>Cornelius grabbed one arm, Karstedt the other, Damuel his cape, Angelica his waist, and Wilfried had managed to dart around his protective wall of retainers to get between Bonifatius and Rozemyne. Ferdinand, meanwhile, had used enhancement magic to reach Rozemyne and block her from her doting grandfather.</p><p>“Stop!” Cornelius yelled. “You’ll crush her!”</p><p>“What?!” he cried. “No I won’t! My granddaughter is too strong to be crushed!”</p><p>“Um…” Rozemyne said, trying to peek out from behind Ferdinand’s cape, “he’s right. I’ve been studying enhancement magic under him for nearly four years now, so…”</p><p>“But Rozemyne,” Wilfried said, “you’ve been doing the bare minimum! You can’t stand up to the full force of his affection. Trust me. He’s scarily strong whenever you’re involved.”</p><p>“He’s right,” Ferdinand said. “Bonifatius, you must calm yourself.”</p><p>The old man grunted, but his expression lightened as Rozemyne danced from behind Ferdinand and said, “Grandfather, will you escort me to the northern building when I’ve finished with my greetings?”</p><p>Ferdinand glared between the two of them as Karstedt asked, “You can handle that much, Father, can’t you?”</p><p>“Of course!” he yelled. “I would never hurt my precious granddaughter!”</p><p>With great effort, Ferdinand tamped down his annoyance and watched with an ever darkening mood as she gave greetings to everyone who was waiting for her. When she reached Ferdinand, she gave him an amused grin and said, “I plan to return to the temple to check on the return of our sacred objects and hear reports from over the winter. I know it is selfish of me, but could I ask you to escort me there?”</p><p>He shot a look to Sylvester who sighed and waved his hand at him.</p><p>“Yes,” he said.</p><p>“I thank you ever so much. If you will excuse me… Grandfather, shall we depart?”</p><p>As Ferdinand watched Bonifatius, Rozemyne, and Wilfried leave with their retainers, he forced himself to calm down. She was likely in less danger here than at the Royal Academy, and Bonifatius would destroy anything that threatened her between the teleportation room and the northern building.</p><p>It was with these relaxing thoughts in mind that he pushed the Knight’s Order to the brink of death during training.</p><p>After the third day of this improved training regimine, Ferdinand left command to Karstedt and escorted Rozemyne to the temple. When they arrived, Hartmut showed her to the prayer room where she confirmed their supplies had been properly returned, checked on her bible, met with her retainers to receive reports, and then went to the orphanage, spending some extra time discussing Lestilaut’s art for <em>A Ditter Story</em> with Wilma to give Laurenz more time with his little brother.</p><p>Rozemyne wrapped up her conversation with Wilma and approached Ferdinand, her soft gaze trained on the two brothers. “It’s a shame he can’t be baptized as a noble. I hate that they have to be separated.”</p><p>Crossing his arms, Ferdinand said, “He’ll receive much better treatment here than as a baptized child of criminals. Ask any of your name sworn how they’re being treated when you aren’t with them.”</p><p>Her gaze fell as she turned away. “I know.”</p><p>“Um, my lord, my lady?”</p><p>Ferdinand and Rozemyne both looked to Janrik, who had been standing off to the side with Justus and Eckhart. When he received permission to speak, he said, “As you know, I will be marrying Lady Anneliese this summer to carry out my duties as head of my household.”</p><p>“Yes,” Rozemyne answered Janrik, “I am ever so looking forward to welcoming Anneliese into my service.”</p><p>At Ferdinand’s request, Elvira had sought out a match for Janrik. Anneliese was a mednoble of the former Veronica faction whose family had only been made to pay fines. However, similar to Janrik and Matthias, she had archnoble levels of mana, and her marriage prospects had all but dried up after the purge. It had taken some discussion between the woman, Elvira, and Rozemyne, but she’d agreed to swear her name to Rozemyne and become her scholar before her starbind ceremony this summer once she completed training under Elvira to reach the level of skill necessary to serve her new lady.</p><p>Once Janrik and Anneliese were wed, it was safe to assume their child would be of archnoble-level mana as well, meaning the house would itself be elevated to archnoble status after meeting the requirement of having three generations of children with the appropriate amount of mana. That would mean Matthias, as a member of Janrik’s household, would also become an archnoble, thus elevating Lieseleta upon their marriage so that she could more easily become Rozemyne’s head attendant in the future.</p><p>Naturally, this would also give Rozemyne a second archnoble knight who could keep Cornelius at bay, but that was merely a fringe benefit and not at all Ferdinand’s main goal in this endeavor.</p><p>Janrik dipped his head to Rozemyne with a warm smile. “I thank you ever so much for your generosity, my lady. I know Lady Anneliese is similarly eager to serve you.”</p><p>“So?” Ferdinand prompted. “What is this about?”</p><p>“Yes, my lord. As you know, our already-low population was cut significantly after the purge, and there already are not enough quality retainers for the archducal family, let alone to support a duchy of our ranking. As such, my future bride and I have discussed adopting Bertram if you would allow it.”</p><p>Rozemyne lit up, but Ferdinand placed a hand on her shoulder to forestall her immediate acceptance. “Explain your reasoning,” he said.</p><p>Janrik nodded. “Yes, my lord. Bertram has a high amount of mana for a med noble child, and with Lady Rozemyne’s compression method, he could easily match my house’s future status and become a much-needed retainer for you or Lady Rozemyne. He has received an appropriate education here in the temple and has developed a mindset I believe would make him suitable for your service. He has no prejudice against the temple, understands the importance of religious ceremonies, and already regularly prays, meaning he will likely enjoy many divine protections when he’s older.</p><p>“On a more personal note, he is the younger brother of Matthias’ best friend, and I would like to give him and Laurenz the same opportunity to stay together that you afforded my family.”</p><p>Nothing Ferdinand could do could stop Rozemyne from instantly accepting his request and offering to draw up the paperwork as soon as the starbind ceremony concluded. They then called over Laurenze to discuss the matter, who immediately knelt and took Rozemyne’s hand, placing it against his forehead as he thanked her for allowing his brother to be adopted. Matthias joined at this point, and the four of them excitedly began making plans for Bertram’s winter debut.</p><p>Off to the side, Hartmut began composing a new chapter for his Saint-of-Ehrenfest sermon while Wilma and several of the orphans listened on, completely enraptured.</p><p>Eventually, they left the orphanage and returned to the High Bishop’s chambers where Ferdinand, Rozemyne, Justus, Eckhart, Matthias, and Gretia entered into the hidden room. Once inside, the name sworn were ordered to face the wall before Ferdinand activated a sound-blocking barrier. When he noticed Rozemyne bracing herself for a lecture, he gave her a smile and beckoned her over with open arms.</p><p>She immediately fell into his embrace with a pleased giggle, and he patted her head as he leaned down and whispered, “Good job on coming first in class once again, Rozemyne. Ehrenfest could not ask for a better archduke candidate. You are my pride and joy.”</p><p>Thankfully, her improved schtappe kept her from involuntarily shooting off a blessing this time, giving him hope that his nightmarish vision of blessings raining down in their bedroom would not come to pass.</p>

<p>“Now then,” Ferdinand said as Rozemyne settled back down in her seat, “you wanted to talk?”</p><p>“Yes,” she said, producing her schtappe and chanting, “Grutrisshiet.” In her hand appeared the strange wooden-tablet shaped book she’d used in the previous weave. “About a few things actually. First, let’s see…” She started tapping and swiping at her book before saying, “This part… I thought I had gotten a complete copy, but there seem to be some gaps here.”</p><p>Furrowing his brows, Ferdinand walked behind her to peer over her shoulder. “Show me.”</p><p>She shifted the book so he would have an easier time seeing it. As she swiped her finger across its surface, she revealed multiple blank spaces in the text, and he immediately recognized what was going on.</p><p>The missing parts were the memories she hadn’t recovered from the previous weave, still stored inside her feystone. While he had no issue with her filling in the parts that would be useful, like taking the foundation of Alexandria, he was hesitant about giving her any knowledge that might lead to her regaining her fear of feystones.</p><p>Well, rather than have her touch her feystone again, fall unconscious, soak in a jureve, and wake up in a similarly confused state as before with no control over which memories she acquired, it would be much better to manually update her book, would it not? He would tell her why he was omitting certain parts, of course, and he was certain she would prefer this method over the other. He certainly would.</p><p>It seemed for once that Mestionora’s pettiness was working in his favor.</p><p>“Ferdinand, why are you smiling like that?” Rozemyne asked, glaring at him with narrowed eyes. “What are you plotting?”</p><p>He straightened his face. “You understand what the missing text is, yes?”</p><p>“My missing memories from the previous weave, right?”</p><p>“Yes, we can address those at a later date. For now, we have more pressing matters, do we not?”</p><p>She gave him a displeased pout but acceded. “Right. The key to the foundation. When’s the best time to tell Sylvester about it, or have you already?”</p><p>Ferdinand went back to his seat and sighed. “I haven’t. Let’s tell him after most of the nobles have left the city. He’ll need to be focused on getting more allies to support the growing Ehrenfest since we’re almost certainly guaranteed to rise in the rankings once again, and we can keep the temple protected until then.”</p><p>“Is that why you had a duplicate made?”</p><p>“Yes, Georgine had stolen it in the previous weave, so I made a decoy to protect the foundation.”</p><p>Rozemyne tilted her head and pressed a finger into her soft cheek. “Why didn’t she do that this weave?”</p><p>“Because the purge happened much earlier,” he said. “Countess Dahldolf had already climbed the towering staircase this time before she had the opportunity to infiltrate the temple, steal your bible, attempt to poison you and Hartmut, and replace the key with the one from Ahrensbach.”</p><p>“Ah, so that was why my bible was stolen,” she murmured. “I figured they just wanted to read it since it’s different from any of the transcriptions. What a fiend! I’m glad she’s gone!”</p><p>Rozemyne’s ruthlessness when it came to books was as harsh as ever.</p><p>“Wait,” she said, “that was how I ended up stealing the foundation, then, wasn’t it?” she asked. “I used the key Countess Dahldolf left behind.”</p><p>He nodded. “That’s enough about that, though,” he said.</p><p>“You’re right. We need to talk about Wilfried and Charlotte getting their Wisdom, too.”</p><p>Ferdinand’s mind went blank.</p><p>“Oh, a [&amp;$@# *&amp;%$*],” she said. “I’ll take this chance to explain, then. First, you said you don’t want me to stand out so much or seem so special, right? Well, if I’m not the only one with the Book of Mestionora, then I’m not special! Second, they forced me to do the shrine tour last time, but since my brother and sister are both so amazing, they might force them, too, right? The same logic applies, then.”</p><p>Her chest was puffed out, and she had the smuggest smile on her face.</p><p>“What the hell are you even saying right now?!” Ferdinand snapped. “Just how does having every Ehrenfest archduke candidate holding the Book of Mestionora seem like a reasonable idea to you?!”</p><p>“What? But several people used to have it at the same time! Archdukes would use it when—“</p><p>“Yes. Archdukes! Not everyone with a seven-colored schtappe! Do you understand what a vulnerable place Ehrenfest is in right now? We’re a neutral duchy that is now on the verge of overtaking an allied greater duchy, and we’re too weak internally to handle the position we’re already in. Members of the royal family are looking at us with suspicion, and Georgine is actively working against us. Take a moment and consider what the three of you having the book would look like to everyone else, especially the Wisdomless royal family.”</p><p>Rozemyne shrugged. “I don’t see where it would matter because they’d have to find out first. You’ve had yours for years, and no one knew. By the way, Erwaermen is still mad at you. You were very rude every time you saw him. That said, don’t offer him an apology. I remembered him telling me to kill you to finish my book in the past weave, so he deserved it.” She huffed and crossed her arms, glaring into the distance as though she thought the tree could see her indignation. “This is to protect ourselves from exploitation in the future, and you can’t tell me it won’t happen because it already did once before. It doesn’t matter if Prince Anastasius is on our side now. If Professor Eglantine bats her eyes at him, he could turn on us just as fast.”</p><p>Ferdinand didn’t think that was too strong a possibility. The prince had yet to make any significant romantic progress with Eglantine from what he could tell, and she’d gotten herself adopted by the second queen to avoid marrying him or Sigiswald. That possibility had long since passed. Since he hadn’t married the girl he escorted, Ferdinand could only assume he had decided to focus on his duties and would take a younger bride at a later date.</p><p>Still, Rozemyne’s hesitance to rely on Anastasius showed how much she had grown compared to the previous weave. It also, however, brought to mind another problem they’d yet to address. “We certainly would not want it coming to light that Charlotte can get the Book of Mestionora. With how out-of-standard she has proven to be with her talents as well, she’s likely to catch the attention of the royals as it is. She’ll need to secure a partner soon to avoid being taken like you nearly were on several occasions in the past.”</p><p>“Yeah, it’s kind of a shame Lestilaut is the heir of Dunkelfelger,” Rozemyne said. “He definitely developed a thing for her, and I think she could keep him in line no problem. Still, she’s adorable, so it’s not like she’ll have a shortage of options. I’d say Wilfried’s friend Ortwin, but he’s probably the next Aub Drewanchel. I’ll have to ask her during our next tea party if she has her eye on anyone because you’re absolutely right - she’s too amazing for the royals not to notice. I’d hate for her to have to marry one of them.</p><p>“So we’ll get them both their books to keep the royal family from doing to them what they did to me.”</p><p>Ferdinand closed his eyes and sighed. “How did we come back to this?”</p><p>“Hm? But didn’t you just say the royal family would snatch up Charlotte if they knew she could get the Book of Mestionora? They could do the same to Wilfried, too, and make him marry either Eglantine or Adolphine as his first wife and bump Hannelore down to second. My brother being zent is a terrible idea, but I could see them doing it if for no other reason than getting their hands on the book. The same goes for Charlotte.”</p><p>Rubbing his temples, he said, “Let’s table this discussion for now. It will be some time before they even have the opportunity to get the book, anyway.”</p><p>“The fact that you’re not going for this suggests you don’t think it’ll actually protect them. If that’s the case, then why did you let me get mine?”</p><p>“Is it not obvious?” he asked, glaring at her. “You’re a book gremlin who would have obtained it regardless of what I said. I thought it better to control your rampage than try to suppress it.”</p><p>“Ngh…!”</p><p>“I see you have no counter argument. Well, then, that concludes our discussion, no? I have duties to attend to, as do you. There will be a meeting soon to discuss the Interduchy Tournament and payouts for the information gathered. Be sure to work with your siblings on that. Include Melchior this time just so he can understand the process. Have you already begun training his retainers in the temple?”</p><p>She nodded. “Yes, and he’ll start coming after the feast celebrating the arrival of spring.”</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>He reached out to turn off the sound-blocking tool, but she stopped him, her bottom lip caught between her teeth.</p><p>“What is it?” he asked, narrowing his eyes at her.</p><p>“Um, well, it’s just… I found a way to use transportation magic circles to connect our hidden rooms, so–”</p><p>“Absolutely not.”</p><p>She blinked at him for a moment then pouted. “Wouldn’t that be easier than all this excuse-finding and sneaking around? Or do you want to start using the amulets? We can’t just keep having our name sworn facing the wall.”</p><p>Ferdinand heaved a great sigh as he pinched the bridge of his nose. “We absolutely should not use the amulets for such shameless reasons. Yes, there have been some times where we needed to be alone, but those should start becoming fewer now that you’re getting older.”</p><p>“So you won’t praise me anymore?!” she gasped, her expression betraying the intense heartbreak those words caused her. It made him grimace as physical pain shot through his chest.</p><p>“I didn’t say that.”</p><p>“Then let’s connect them!”</p><p>She wasn’t going to let this go, was she? Surely she understood, didn’t she? She’d been an adult woman in her previous life, and she was old enough now to have been warmed by Brennwärme’s flames. Either way, he absolutely refused to explain why this was a terrible idea. Instead, he chose to find another way to make her abandon it.</p><p>“If you truly want to connect our hidden rooms,” he said, “then you’ll have to accept my name first.”</p><p>She froze for several moments before she tilted her head and asked, “Why?”</p><p>Was she playing him? Surely this had to be some sort of prank. “Is it not obvious?” he asked. “To be Schutzaria’s shield.”</p><p>It took a few moments for her to understand what he meant, but he could tell the instant she did as her face flushed, and she started flapping her mouth in an attempt to find something to say. Eventually, she spluttered, “Th-th-that wasn’t what I meant! I wasn’t thinking anything like that at all! How could you even think that?! I’m still so young!”</p><p>“You are now,” he said, “but in a mere two years, you will actually be of age, will you not? Would you seriously consider giving a man unfettered access to your chambers without having control over his actions?”</p><p>That brought her up short. After a moment, she shook her head and cast her gaze down. “I’m sorry. I wasn’t thinking that far ahead.”</p><p>“Obviously. Now, we have work to do, do we not?”</p><p>He went to deactivate the magic tool again but stopped. She looked so disappointed, and his main objective had been to praise her, not chastise her. With a heavy high, he beckoned her over and held her in his arms for a short while, telling her again how proud he was of her.</p><p>She seemed appeased by the time he left.</p><p> </p><p>Ferdinand returned to training the Knight’s Order while Rozemyne finished her duties in the temple before coming back to the castle to manage the end-of-winter book sale. Meanwhile, Sylvester was killing himself trying to unite the nobles of Ehrenfest. The northern giebes were easy. He presented the knowledge on recreating the stages for the ones who had lost theirs. They readily praised both him and Charlotte for their ceaseless efforts in bringing early spring to their provinces.</p><p>Leisegang, however, was having none of it, and when they accused him of keeping their princess from socializing with them, he said, “If she hasn’t socialized with you, then that was by her own choice. Have you heard how she and my other children have been running the dormitory? Maybe her issue is that the way you’ve chosen to conduct yourselves is counterintuitive to her efforts, or perhaps it’s your refusal to take the printing industry seriously.”</p><p>Count Leisegang tried to threaten him with their status as the breadbasket of the duchy, but Sylvester was unmoved. “We’re trading with several upper-ranking duchies now. Do you think we can’t trade in food as well?”</p><p>“Are…are you threatening us?” the count growled. “After everything your mother put us through?!”</p><p>“No,” he said. “I’m informing you of the reality of the situation. I did not purge traitors to our duchy in order to create the same situation my father let fester but in reverse. The face of Ehrenfest is changing, and we have to change to match it. This current attitude is no longer befitting our rank.”</p><p>The count scoffed and replied, “Then we should let our rank fall!”</p><p>Sylvester gave him a long, hard look before he turned to Ferdinand, who was watching the spectacle over the lip of his teacup, and said, “Rozemyne is in the playroom, is she not? Summon her.”</p><p>Ferdinand did as ordered, and before long, Rozemyne arrived with her mixed entourage of nobles from Leisegang and the former Veronica faction. Sylvester bade her sit and then turned back to the count. “Now, as much of our increased rank is due to the efforts of our archduke candidates, you should make your request to one of them directly.”</p><p>“Oh, what request?” Rozemyne asked, tilting her head and placing her hand on her cheek.</p><p>The count grit his teeth, and after glaring at the aub muttered that the duchy’s new rank didn’t suit them and should be lowered.</p><p>She deleted the tilt of her head. “Oh, dear. That really is a shame. Here I thought with how swiftly you adopted the printing industry, you were a flexible enough thinker to handle leading your house during these changing times.” She cast her eyes down. “However, I suppose I expected too much of a province that half-heartedly embraced the duchy’s new industry. Fortunately, if you find yourself unable to cope with the changing times, the younger generation is more than capable of stepping in. They certainly have a mindset more in line with what is needed for Ehrenfest now that we are in the upper ranks.”</p><p>“What?” the giebe gasped. “You…you would…?”</p><p>“Suggest to the aub that anyone who stands in the way of progress, refuses to work with the other factions to stand against the scrutiny of other duchies, and actively seeks to hurt Ehrenfest be replaced with those willing to do what it takes to make our duchy worthy of its rank? Yes, I absolutely would.” She turned away from the paling man and said, “Sylvester, I think Charlotte would be a wonderful person to consult on this matter. You see, she has made such strides in improving diplomatic relations at the Academy. She can surely better inform others of the political realities of our situation and what awaits us should we fail to adapt to our new role.”</p><p>Heeding her advice, Sylvester summoned Charlotte who greeted the count warmly and then immediately began running circles around him with support from her father. Perhaps the most salient point was that if the duchy proved incapable of acting in a manner befitting its rank, others of high rank would begin trying to snatch away Ehrenfest’s exceptional archduke candidates, starting with Rozemyne as the easiest target.</p><p>By the end, Giebe Leisegang had a thorough understanding of his overall insignificance in Yurgenschmidt and the transient nature of his role as head of his house. He at least seemed to grasp that he was not arguing from the position of power he thought he was and that the younger Leisegangs were merely waiting for the opportunity to overtake his generation.</p><p>Ferdinand truly hoped the count would heed the warnings he’d received. Ehrenfest would not benefit from weathering yet another political upheaval.</p><p> </p><p>The spring feast came to an end, and once most of the nobles had left, Melchior was sworn in as a priest and started training under Hartmut along with his retainers. After Rozemyne had seen him settled in, she prepared to take Benno and Lutz to The Sovereignty, Klassenberg, Dunkelfelger, and Drewanchel to establish paper-making and printing guilds. Wilfried would be going along, too, as another noble who represented the printing industry along with both children’s entourages.</p><p>Ordinarily, Ferdinand would not be permitted to go as knight commander, but Sylvester made an exception, saying, “Even the gods know to wait until the end of winter to take Geduldh from Ewigeliebe.” Despite his brother’s foolishness, he was grateful for the chance to accompany his fiancé on her first trip to other duchies.</p><p>They’d received permission to use the teleportation circles at the Royal Academy to ease the burden of their journey, but even so, there was still a significant amount of luggage given the number of people coming along. Rozemyne had trained over the summer to make her pandabus as large as possible, and while she could not expand it as much as she could when she still had Mestionora’s mana, she was still able to make a two-story highbeast that would hold nearly everything they would need to bring, including the commoners. She absolutely refused to let any of her Gutenbergs or commoner retainers take carriages in unknown lands, reasoning that they would be easy targets for anyone who wanted to find out Ehrenfest’s trade secrets. “Hugo and Ella are especially vulnerable!” she argued. “Anyone would want to kidnap my personal chefs to get access to their recipes.”</p><p>She wasn’t wrong, so Sylvester approved it, even though it meant she would have no room for any of her noble entourage to join her, save for Philine and Damuel who might struggle to travel long distances and Judith who would be protecting her from the passenger’s seat. While the concept of drivable highbeasts was no longer completely foreign to Yurgenschmidt, expandible ones were, so Ferdinand reasoned they would cause a stir no matter who was inside the out-of-standard monstrosity Rozemyne called “cute.”</p><p>They were visiting the duchies in order of ranking, beginning with the Sovereignty. The day of departure passed similarly to how it did at the beginning of a term at the Royal Academy. As Rosina, Ella, and Hugo had made the journey before, they split Mark, Benno, and Lutz amongst themselves to ease them through their first teleportation. Unsurprisingly, when Ferdinand came through, he found Lutz and Benno wearing faces pale with suppressed queasiness. As he drew close, he smirked and muttered to them, “Rozemyne becomes ill when teleporting as well.” That brought small smiles to both them and Mark, who seemed as nonplussed as ever.</p><p>Eventually, everyone made it through, but since Ferdinand was here in his capacity as knight commander, he couldn’t escort Rozemyne and had to instead follow behind as Wilfried offered her his arm instead. He told himself over and over that it didn’t bother him, but each repetition just made the lie more pronounced.</p><p>Once they were settled in, Rozemyne sent an ordonnanz to Prince Anastasius to let him know they’d arrived, and a response came to expect someone shortly. Before long, one of the prince’s retainers knocked on their door, and he escorted the Ehrenfest party to the prince’s villa. They were led into the meeting room in the back where Anastasius presumably always brought Rozemyne, and after tea was served, the room was cleared save for Oswin, Anastasius’ head attendant, Rozemyne, and Ferdinand. The prince wasted no time in erecting a sound-blocking barrier and leveling his cool gaze at the both of them.</p><p>“You have impeccable timing,” he said. “It wasn’t two days ago that I caught a traitor in our midst, and I have you to thank for it, Rozemyne.”</p><p>“Oh?” she asked, taking a sip of her tea. It was her preferred blend, of course. The prince seemed to know her well. “May I ask how I was of assistance to you, Prince Anastasius?”</p><p>“Was it not you who said to look into anything that might cover an illicit sweet scent or for those who had contact with both my brother and Ahrensbach on a frequent basis despite being confirmed to not be under the influence of nefarious substances?”</p><p>“So someone was burning it under your very noses?” Ferdinand asked.</p><p>“Quite literally, yes,” Anastasius sighed. “It is…worryingly easy to slip into calming incense. One might not notice the difference even in their preferred fragrance as its scent is easily overpowered by others. I was able to identify and free victims amongst my family the night before the graduation ceremony, but I have only just now been able to apprehend the culprit.”</p><p>“Oh, my,” Rozemyne said. “I do hope it was the actual culprit and not an expendable pawn.”</p><p>Anatasisus’s eyes narrowed. “I assure you, he was no mere pawn. Not with his rank.” His gaze flicked between his two guests before he said under his breath, “It should come as no surprise to you, Rozemyne, who it was as he cast the most suspicion upon you during the Dedication Ritual.”</p><p>She lowered her eyes and placed a troubled hand on her cheek. “I am ever so sorry to hear it. I had thought him merely thorough with his duty to protect the royal family. I…never suspected anything malicious behind his actions.”</p><p>“Neither did we,” he admitted, “which is how he managed to slip by unnoticed for so long.”</p><p>Ferdinand sipped his tea - not his preferred blend - as he put the pieces together. Raublut had hidden trug in the king’s incense and then at Georgine’s request, asked him to get Rozemyne to give the blessing at the graduation ceremony. To hide his involvement, he then got Sigiswald to repeat the request in front of other members of the royal family. Georgine would then have people in the crowd start clamoring for Rozemyne to join the Sovereign Temple, which the king would be more inclined to accept, especially after another hit of trug that evening.</p><p>However, Aub Ehrenfest’s insistence that all three of his children at the Royal Academy participate diluted Rozemyne’s perceived worth, and Anastasius cleansing his father of trug’s influence had led him to conduct the ceremony in a way that gave gratitude to Ehrenfest rather than sought to take something from them.</p><p>Anastasius likely then started with the incense and traced its use back to Raublut and discovered his treachery then. Of course, having it discovered was a boon, but…</p><p>“What do you plan to do with him?” Ferdinand asked.</p><p>The prince shook his head. “There is no plan. He climbed the towering staircase before anything could be done.”</p><p>A blessing and a curse. Ferdinand didn’t need the royal family to recognize his connection to Adalgisa, but that also meant they lost the potential to find concrete evidence of Georgine’s betrayal. As much as he didn’t want to, he may have to provide it himself, though he didn’t know when he would be able to. It would depend on how fast Rozemyne’s exclusives moved.</p><p>“That said,” Anatasisus continued, “I doubt he was the only enemy hiding under Verbergen’s cloak. Do take care during your journey this spring.”</p><p>“We thank you ever so much for your concern,” Rozemyne said, dipping her head.</p><p>Anastasius nodded and then signaled to his retainer before deactivating the sound-blocking tool. “Call in the scholars. We’ll discuss these guilds of yours before I have Emmerich meet with your merchants.”</p><p>And so Ferdinand silently observed as Elvira, Emmerich, Rozemyne, and Anastasius hashed out the most important details of the guild agreements before he guarded his fiancée as she moved to another meeting room where she supported Benno during his negotiations with Emmerich on the finer points of the arrangements. After that, they returned to the dormitory where the nobles and commoners parted ways for the rest of the evening, and then Rozemyne carried the Gutenbergs over to the Sovereign Merchant’s Guild the next day to get the Paper-Making and Printing Guilds established. They also formalized the process for abiding by the legal deposit, copyright, and patent fee systems. For the Sovereignty, it would be easy. They would send items to the Royal Academy to be teleported over. For the rest of the duchies, they would have to wait for the Archduke Conference in the spring or the start of the Academy term until other arrangements could be made.</p><p>Once they wrapped up business in the Sovereignty, they prepared to depart for Klassenberg.</p>

</h3>

<div class="userstuff module" role="article">
<h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
<p>As the Ehrenfest party could not teleport from the dormitories directly into the castles of the duchies they were visiting, they would have to travel via highbeast. Since Klassenberg bordered Ehrenfest, they would travel back home, spend the night, then fly to the other duchy first thing in the morning. It took some time to get the luggage loaded into Rozemyne’s bizarre highbeast, but they were able to leave soon after second bell, and it wasn’t long before they arrived at the border gate by Haldenzel.</p><p>The gate hadn’t been opened for quite some time, and while the Haldenzel side was fully into spring, the Klassenberg side was still half-buried under snow. Even so, Aub Klassenberg had made sure that they would be able to pass through once they went through the proper procedures and presented their permit of travel.</p><p>One of the aub’s retainers and twenty-five members of the Klassenberg Knight’s Order met them at the gate and then guided them the rather lengthy distance to the castle. The trip there was dull as everything was covered in snow. As Ferdinand recalled, they mostly lived underground during the winter, and it would be some time before the spring rays reached this far north and melted the ice.</p><p>The castle itself dwarfed Ehrenfest’s, though the temple was nearly identical to theirs from what Ferdinand could tell from so far away. They followed the red capes down to a landing spot where a couple dozen attendants awaited them. Everyone alighted from their beasts with Rozemyne telling the commoners to remain inside hers as the weather was too bitterly cold for people without feystone armor to endure for long.</p><p>“Welcome to Klassenberg,” the man in the front said. “I am Severin, attendant in charge of castle affairs. Do allow us to use this teleportation circle to speed along the transfer of luggage to your rooms.”</p><p>Ferdinand sent Justus and Eckhart to go wait on the other side of the circle to ensure nothing was amiss during transport and closely observed as the Klassenberg attendants assisted the Ehrenfest retainers in unloading the pandabus. Once the nobles’ luggage was taken care of, Rozemyne asked Severin, “Might I take my Gutenbergs to where they will be staying in the lower city?”</p><p>“Yes,” he said, “Dagobert will be guiding you to the closest entrance to the underground. I’m afraid your…highbeast will not fit, however.”</p><p>“Oh, that’s not a problem,” she said. After getting the passengers to step out momentarily, she reduced the size to something more reasonable and rushed the commoners back inside. “Will that do?”</p><p>All the attendants were staring at her highbeast in utter shock, but they had the wherewithal to keep their mouths from hanging open. After a moment, Severin snapped out of his stupor and offered a smile to Rozemyne. “Most excellent. Dagobert?”</p><p>The younger attendant bade Rozemyne follow him, and off she and her guard knights flew towards their lower city. She would be gone for a few bells at least, which made Ferdinand uneasy. However, there was little he could do besides pray for her safety, so he forced himself to focus on the tasks at hand to keep his mind off his nagging worry.</p><p>They were shown to their rooms which were as extravagant as one would expect from the first-ranked duchy. Everything was decorated in shades of deep crimson, however, giving Ferdinand the impression of a room covered in blood with portraits of former Zents with Klassenberg origins in each of the rooms. It was an interesting tactic to intimidate visitors. He was somewhat impressed.</p><p>Once they were settled in, Ferdinand had Justus, Eckhart, and Janrik search the room for any secret passages, peep holes, or other such ways their hosts might spy on them. This included looking for magic tools, but the only ones they found were the standard tools for everyday use. There was a place one could listen in on conversations hidden behind a tapestry, but there appeared to be no door that would lead into the hidden passage.</p><p>As such, Ferdinand spoke to Justus with hand signals while they carried on a mundane conversation about the weather. Once Justus had his orders, he slipped on the amulet of Verbergen and followed Ferdinand out the door when he went to check on the other rooms. What Ferdinand wouldn’t have given to have had that magic tool back in Ahrensbach…</p><p>Wilfried was engaging in exercises to burn off nervous energy when Ferdinand arrived at his rooms. They talked for a brief moment before he handed a sound-blocking tool to the boy to warn him of eavesdroppers. Wilfried nodded and said, “Leopold found one on the far wall over there. We’ve been careful about what we talk about.”</p><p>“Oh?” Ferdinand asked. “I’m rather impressed by your retainers.”</p><p>“You did train them, Uncle,” Wilfried replied with a grin. “We decided this would be a good opportunity to spread information we want everyone to have, like emphasizing the role of the temple and religious ceremonies, looking into their history to find old rituals like in Haldenzel, how we cleaned up the temple, and how having us participate in the Dedication Ritual and Spring Prayer increased our crop yields.”</p><p>Ferdinand raised his brows and held his chin in his hand. “I see. I’m surprised you came up with such a tactic.”</p><p>“Controlling information is just another part of preparing for battle,” Wilfried said. “If you control what your enemies know, then you can control their movements. You taught me that yourself.”</p><p>“So I did,” Ferdinand said with a smile. How was Wilfried of all people shaping up into such a fine knight commander? He was so utterly useless in the previous weave. Ferdinand cast his gaze about the room, taking in all the retainers that the boy hadn’t had before and noting the ones that were missing. That such a seemingly insignificant change would yield such drastically different results would never cease to amaze him.</p><p>Once he finished with Wilfried, he went to Rozemyne’s room where her attendants and scholars were working on sorting luggage and reports. They needed no instruction, of course, but he did tell Rihyarda about the possible eavesdropping and trusted her to disseminate the information. He also told them about Wilfried’s plan and suggested they do the same with the understanding that Rozemyne would also use the opportunity to shill Ehrenfest merchandise.</p><p>With that, Ferdinand returned to his own rooms and discussed innocuous things while completing paperwork he’d brought with him. Eventually, Rozemyne returned, so Ferdinand opened the door to his rooms, letting Justus in who stepped to the side, deactivated the amulet, and then went with his lord to see the girl.</p><p>She beamed upon seeing him and asked Rihyarda to fetch Wilfried while Lieseleta prepared tea. When the boy arrived, they went through the customary poison test before Rozemyne launched into a detailed account of her trip to the Klassenberg lower city.</p><p>Despite their nobility ranking higher than any other save royalty, they seemed to interact with their commoners far more than those in Ehrenfest. Perhaps because they were underground, the streets were lit with feystone-powered lights similar to what nobles used, and Rozemyne had seen what appeared to be a laynoble changing out one of the feystones. The city itself was clean, and even the commoner inns where the Gutenbergs were staying had waste disposal systems like noble houses. They also used feystone-powered devices to heat water for baths, though they still had to go draw it from nearby wells.</p><p>“So I would like to speak to Aub Klassenberg about purchasing the blueprints for the hand pumps as well,” Rozemyne said. “If they’re already sending people to learn how to make letter types, then it wouldn’t take much more time for Johann to show them how to make the precision part the pumps require. The Klassenberg craftsmen will be staying later, anyway, because it’ll take longer for the roads to be traversable with all the snow.”</p><p>Wilfried nodded. “Yeah, I think that’s a good idea. It would probably help improve our relationship with Klassenberg, but have you talked to Father about it?”</p><p>“Not this specifically, but he did say to keep an eye out for opportunities like this. He gave me some magic letters so I could write to him about these sorts of things, so I’ll send one to him tonight. Hopefully, I’ll get a reply before our meeting with the aub two days from now.”</p><p>“I believe that is where your generosity should end,” Ferdinand said. “Business dealings are conducted at the Archduke Conference. Simply make a list of items you want to spread and provide it to Sylvester when we return.”</p><p>“Right,” Rozemyne said before glancing at the wall and adding, “He’s supposed to be looking at selling the production method for rinsham this spring, right?”</p><p>Ferdinand smirked. She had chosen to share information that would have no effect but still felt secret enough to give their spies something to report on. “Yes,” he said. “That’s the current plan at any rate.”</p><p>“I’m rather looking forward to our stay here,” she said with a polite smile. “I hope we will be able to try some foods native to Klassenberg that we haven’t seen yet. Maybe we’ll find some more fruits that will pair well with pound cake.”</p><p>And now she was making requests. This girl never missed an opportunity.</p><p>“Anyway, about the lower city,” she said, shifting the topic back, “it truly is a sight to behold. It seems the temple, however, is in dire need of reform. No one even wanted to talk about it. It was obvious that they didn’t understand how important it is. I’m a little disappointed that a duchy as old as Klassenberg would leave their temple to wallow in filth. I’m sure such a great duchy would have kept records showing how members of the archducal family used to act as High Bishop.”</p><p>Wilfried nodded. “Maybe that’s why they’re unable to summon spring like we do in Haldenzel. If they’ve lost their connection to the temple, then they probably don’t know about the ritual. Didn’t Father and Charlotte find the instructions for doing it in the underground archive?”</p><p>“Yes,” she replied, “which is how our provinces who destroyed their stages will be able to rebuild them so they, too, can summon spring.”</p><p>The two of them continued talking about various matters related to the temple and rituals with Ferdinand occasionally interjecting to add to their points. They wanted this information to spread, and it wasn’t as if Klassenberg could convincingly claim credit for reviving the spring ritual. At this point, everyone would assume that anything related to religious matters would have come from the Ehrenfest archduke candidates.</p><p>Of course, even if they did take credit, it wouldn’t matter. Ehrenfest had drawn more than enough attention to itself.</p><p>Once they parted ways and Ferdinand had returned to his room, he passed Justus a sound-blocking tool as he moved to the desk to sit. “Report.”</p><p>“Yes, my lord. There is much talk of the Ehrenfest archduke candidates. Topics include their large mana capacities, their time in the temple, and marriage candidates. In that regard, there were discussions about you taking a second wife as well.”</p><p>“Ridiculous,” Ferdinand spat.</p><p>Justus smiled at him and dipped his head. “We are all aware of your feelings towards milady.” At Ferdinand’s glare, he amended his statement. “We know you will view her as your all goddess upon her coming of age. For now, you are her Erwachlehren.”</p><p>He nodded. “So long as you understand.”</p><p>“Yes, my lord. It seems the aub wants to have Princess Eglantine marry someone from Klassenberg to further solidify their place in the royal family, but she has rejected all attempts to send her a suitor. The second queen does not allow unknown men into her villa, which is where the princess has been living since her adoption presumably to avoid the princes. She is maintaining only the bare minimum contact with Klassenberg.</p><p>“They are hopeful that the higher import tax on sugar will increase demand for honey. They saw a boost after milady introduced honey-flavored pound cake. They want her to figure out new honey-based recipes, which is why they agreed to send Ehrenfest local food stuffs. However, as milady has yet to spread anything of significance using honey, they are disappointed.</p><p>“They are very curious about how Haldenzel’s weather changes overnight. They assume it’s a religious ritual, but they’ve yet to find anything related to it in their archives.</p><p>“The aub’s family has been overheard discussing milady’s relationship with Prince Anastasius and wonder if this is Ehrenfest declaring their support of him for the throne. As Princess Eglantine rejected his advances, there is speculation that milady is using her position as a friend of the princess to steer her towards the prince. They worry that her growing influence may put undue weight behind Ehrenfest’s support.</p><p>“The aub’s cousin appears to have taken a lover. I’ll spare you the details on what is driving this speculation, but it seems his wife has taken one as well.</p><p>“With the results of the research on divine protections, the aub is planning to adopt an archnoble girl. She may end up being a wife for his youngest son.</p><p>“The aub’s youngest son is still wetting the bed even though he will be baptized this summer. They have resorted to placing sheets treated with beeswax under the sheets he sleeps on in an attempt to block the moisture from reaching the bedding.”</p><p>The rest of the information was about which vegetables were the freshest and the like. Ferdinand leaned back and closed his eyes, heaving a great sigh. It seemed Klassenberg had taken notice of Ehrenfest’s rise in the ranks as well as their tenuous alliance with Anastasius and wanted to find a way to exert control over them. If they could get one of theirs tied to an archduke candidate, then they would have the avenue they needed to start influencing Ehrenfest politics.</p><p>Perhaps they could be ameliorated with knowledge of the Haldenzel ritual and a couple of honey-based trends spreading through the Academy next term. Either way, Ferdinand would not allow the First to meddle in their internal affairs.</p><p>What worried him more, however, was whether Klassenberg was alone in its assumptions regarding who Ehrenfest was supporting for the throne. If not, then the Archduke Conference was going to be more problematic than anticipated.</p><p>—————-</p><p>Over the next two days, they continued their information campaign before meeting with the aub. He was around Sylvester’s age with light gold hair and eyes to match, and he had a calculating look to his eyes that contrasted with his soft smile. He welcomed them to his duchy and served tea and pound cake made with a fruit Ferdinand had never seen before. It seemed Rozemyne’s request had been honored.</p><p>They opened with polite conversation before the aub changed the topic.</p><p>“Your blessing at the graduation ceremony was superb. I don’t know that I’ve ever seen anything so beautiful. To think you spent so much mana without so much as a blink. Truly phenomenal.”</p><p>“We thank you ever so much for the praise,” Wilfried said. “It was our honor to answer the Zent’s request.”</p><p>The aub smiled at him. “Yes, I’d heard from my cousin Princess Eglantine that the Zent wanted you to demonstrate the power of rituals, and did you ever. However, was there not another reason hidden under Verbergen’s shroud? Gebordnung must work with Chaosfliehe when it’s suspected Chaocipher is playing with those in the highest seats. Is that not so?”</p><p>Ferdinand frowned. So the aub had been told that the blessing was a test of loyalty, had he? “We serve at the pleasure of the Zent and have no intentions of stepping from under his cloak,” he replied.</p><p>“Perhaps, but what Sehweit can’t see might as well not exist, no? However, Kunstzeal has never been influenced by Chaocipher. Standing with her would assure everyone that you stand firmly in the shadow of the Supreme God’s cloak, would it not? Lady Charlotte remains yet unattached, and with her impressive display of mana, you will need to decide with whom you shall stand.”</p><p>Rozemyne smiled at him and said, “Which god or goddess we stand with would be decided by Aub Ehrenfest, yes?”</p><p>With a nod, Ferdinand added, “It would be inappropriate for us to discuss such matters here.” After all, it was Sylvester’s job to decide on Charlotte’s engagement. Regardless, she wouldn’t be going to Aub Klassenberg as a second or third wife when she was destined to be the next Aub Ehrenfest.</p><p>The aub turned his attention to Wilfried and said, “I will be adopting a daughter here soon. Perhaps you are looking for a water goddess?”</p><p>The boy gave a stiff smile and said, “I have all the goddesses I need. You shouldn’t drink all of Ventole’s blessings at one time, after all.”</p><p>After firmly rejecting the aub twice, they were now going to enter into discussions with a dissatisfied man. At least they already had the most important details done. They were merely discussing setting up guilds and timelines for Klassenberg’s craftsmen to come to Ehrenfest for training. One of their merchants already cost them trade slots, so the aub had to tread carefully.</p><p>They eventually started negotiations with the aub’s scholar and Elvira taking part. They tried to push for Ehrenfest craftsmen to go to Klassenberg rather than the other way around, but Rozemyne was having none of it. She instead managed to negotiate for him to pay a rather high fee for the water pump blueprints, likely just for trying to use his authority to put her Gutenbergs in a situation where they could be kidnapped and extorted for their knowledge. Of course, that was merely a verbal agreement. Aub Ehrenfest would strike the final deal, but Ferdinand knew Rozemyne had no intention of letting Sylvester back down.</p><p>Once the details were agreed upon, they wrapped up the meeting, and Rozemyne headed for the lower city as soon as she was able, this time with Elvira in tow. She returned just before dinner, saying she found a restaurant that seemed to be modeled after hers, though the food didn’t smell anywhere near as appetizing. There were also stores selling simple flower hairpins. While they were not up to the standard of the ones created in Ehrenfest, Rozemyne suspected they only produced ones like what she wore as custom orders. “Of course it didn’t take long for the duchy obsessed with art to figure out how to make them,” she sighed, resigned to the situation.</p><p>That aside, the guilds were set up without issue, and Benno had been introduced to some of the people that would be training under the Gutenbergs in the winter. Seeing examples of their work had convinced him that they would be able to handle the precision required of them.</p><p>They ate with the aub and his family that night with each of them needling them on engagements for Charlotte, Wilfried, and Ferdinand. They quickly abandoned trying to get him to accept a water goddess, however, after the steely look he gave them while he said, “Rozemyne will be able to fill the role of all my goddesses when we bind our stars.” This caused his fiancée to blush beautifully, which only hammered in the point that theirs was not merely a political match. He wasn’t comfortable with the implication that he held inappropriate feelings for one in her summer, but he would not suffer talks of water goddesses before his all goddess.</p><p>Of course, Wilfried’s “support” had only added to the probable misunderstanding. The boy had shaken his head and said, “Ewigeliebe only looks at Geduldh, and Geduldh only accepts Ewigeliebe’s touch.”</p><p>He could have strangled the boy then and there.</p><p>The blunder brought marriage talks to an awkward end, so at least there was some benefit to his suffering.</p><p>Rozemyne was able to salvage the situation by asking if anyone was working towards earning Kuntzeal’s blessing, and she expertly guided the conversation to temple reform and religious rituals that they still had records of. She was not, however, able to secure any time in their book room.</p><p>It was on this “horribly disappointing, utterly devastating” note that they retired to their rooms before leaving for Ehrenfest in the morning.</p>

<p>When the Ehrenfest group reached Dunkelfelger’s border gate, Heisshitze was there to greet them along with roughly fifty other knights who were far too excited for their own good. “Ferdinand! Welcome to Dunkelfelger!” Heisshitze said as they passed through the gate. “Ah, how it broke my heart when your engagement fell through. I thought I would never be able to welcome you to my homeland, but here you are!”</p><p>“Engagement?” Rozemyne asked, her smile broad and her brows raised.</p><p>Heisshitze’s eyes widened as he looked between the two of them. “Oh, uh… Nothing! Never mind! We should get going, yes? We need to plan for the welcome ditter!”</p><p>“No,” Ferdinand said, waving him off. “I have no reason to participate, nor do I want to.”</p><p>“Five zimmer fruits.”</p><p>That gave him pause.</p><p>“And a blitzfreiche.”</p><p>Ferdinand frowned but then shook his head. “No, I am here as knight commander. I cannot abandon my duties for a ditter match.”</p><p>A pall fell over the gathered knights as Ferdinand dealt their enthusiasm a killing blow. They knew better than anyone the responsibilities laid upon a knight commander’s shoulders. “That’s a shame,” Heisshitze sighed. Then, not a heartbeat later, he grinned and dropped a heavy hand on Ferdinand’s shoulder. “Knight commander, though! I’m so glad they finally let you out of the temple so you could follow your true calling!”</p><p>“Oh, my,” Rozemyne said, placing a hand on her cheek as she tilted her head. “I believe you’ve misunderstood something. Ferdinand was not ‘let out.’ He chose to leave. He rather enjoyed his time in the temple.”</p><p>Ferdinand nodded. “I was afforded time for research, which is more than I can say for my current role.”</p><p>“I don’t know about Dunkelfelger’s temple,” Wilfried said, butting into the conversation, “but it’s a respectable place in Ehrenfest. All of the archduke’s children are a part of it.”</p><p>Heisshitze nodded. “Yes, so we’ve heard. We’ve been cleaning up our own temple following your example, and the aub has permitted us to donate mana to the divine instruments. Behold!” He withdrew his schtappe, chanted the spell, and morphed it into Leidenschaft’s spear.</p><p>“Oh,” Rozemyne said, her eyes wide, “how wonderful! I’m sure Leidenschaft was very happy with your prayers and mana!”</p><p>“Of course he was,” Wilfried scoffed. “How else would he be able to make the spear?”</p><p>“At any rate,” Rozemyne said, “I am ever so glad to hear that you are returning the house of the gods to its proper state. Now, while we travel, I would so dearly love to hear more about this engagement you mentioned earlier.”</p><p>“Rozemyne…” Ferdinand growled.</p><p>She merely tilted her head at him with a look of false confusion. “Yes, Ferdinand? Is there a problem?”</p><p>“Do not dredge up ancient history.”</p><p>“Oh, but you’re still in your twenties. How ancient could it possibly be? Tell me, Heisshitze, who was he engaged to?”</p><p>Heisshitze, having completely forgotten his earlier attempt to avoid this topic, answered with a proud, “Why, the third queen! Queen Magdelena!”</p><p>Wilfried and Rozemyne both turned shocked expressions to Ferdinand. “So that story about Queen Magdelena breaking off her engagement by getting a bride task…” Wilfried said. “That was <em>you</em>?”</p><p>“And what a tragic day that was for Dunkelfelger,” Heisshitz sighed. “But enough about that. Let us depart for the castle!”</p><p>Thankfully, it was difficult for Rozemne to carry on conversations from within her highbeast, so Ferdinand didn’t have to deal with the incessant questioning or the embarrassing answers. It hardly seemed fair to him how she tried to root around in his past relationships (if the only one he briefly had could be called that) when he hadn’t attempted to delve into any from her previous life. He knew that she hadn’t had any, but that was beside the point.</p><p>As they neared the fortress that was Dunkelfelger’s castle, Ferdinand saw a rather large group of people waiting to welcome them, and when he recognized who was at the front, he sighed heavily.</p><p>“FERDINAND! Wilfried! Rozemyne! Welcome to Dunkelfelger!”</p><p>Of course Aub Dunkelfelger would be waiting outside the castle to welcome them personally. They offered their formal greetings, and then the aub moved to stand before Wilfried with his arms crossed, his glare harsh. “I take it from the hopeful glint in your eye that you wish to see my daughter.”</p><p>Wilfried’s cheeks tinged pink as he said, “I am here as a representative for my duchy’s primary industry. …However, if there is time, yes, I would like to see her.”</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger continued to glare down at the boy, but he didn’t back down. After a few moments, the aub laughed and slapped Wilfried on the shoulder several times. “A straightforward man, I see! No one would ever guess you’d be capable of such devious ditter tactics! There will be time for you to see my Hannelore, don’t you worry! We’ll give you a grand tour of our capital city, but be warned! It’s so enchanting that you may wish to marry into Dunkelfelger rather than take my daughter to Ehrenfest.”</p><p>“With all due respect, Aub Dunkelfelger, I would never go against Lady Hannelore’s wishes to fulfill my own selfish desires like that.”</p><p>The aub boomed another laugh. “Oh, this one’s slick, isn’t he?! Was it that blessing from Grammaratur who dances with Efflorelume that enchanted my daughter? Well, son, you’ve just convinced me to keep a close eye on you. Very close.”</p><p>That made Wilfried gulp, but he maintained eye contact until the aub turned away.</p><p>“Ah, and if it isn’t the Saint of Evil herself!”</p><p>Rozemyne shot Ferdinand a look that said, <em>The Saint of what now? What did you do, and why didn’t you tell me?</em></p><p>He shot one right back that said, <em>Is it not a fitting moniker?</em></p><p>She was not pleased with the response.</p><p>“Your tactics were worthy of one engaged to the Lord of Evil himself!” the aub continued. “Destroying our supplies! Erecting a shield around my Hannelore and using the God of Darkness’ very own cape to eject her guards!” He paused, then added in a deep voice, “Dusting one of our ancient treasures.”</p><p>Rozemyne smiled sweetly at him. “My, but must you not be ready to lose everything, even your life, the moment you step on the ditter field?”</p><p>“SAINT OF EVIL!” the gathered knights chorused.</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger laughed and raised his hand to slap her shoulder but caught himself. “A fine ditter player indeed! Come, all of you must prepare for our welcoming ditter!”</p><p>Ferdinand sighed and repeated that he was acting as knight commander, not a member of the archducal family.</p><p>“Ah, but the Saint of Evil and my future son-in-law are not knight commanders, are they? And when one visits another land, is it not necessary to follow their customs? I can’t believe those from the Seventh, especially my future son-in-law, would spit in our faces by declining to play in the welcoming ditter.”</p><p>Ferdinand ground his teeth, but he immediately perked up as Rozemyne said, “We indeed would not be so rude. However, as we were completely unfamiliar with this custom, we are rather unprepared. Might I ask you to allow us to gather materials and brew what we need to participate in a match worthy of such a generous welcome?”</p><p>“Of course! Of course! We would not dream of taking on underprepared opponents! Heisshitze! You will lead them as they harvest from our abundant lands! And fear not! Our winters are mild, and Flutrane comes early, so there are plenty of materials to gather! You can set out tomorrow. Tonight, you will dine with us!”</p><p>With that, they were at last permitted to unload their luggage and retire to their rooms. Rozemyne, of course, had to wait a bit longer to rest as she had to take the Gutenbergs to where they were staying in the lower city.</p><p>The room was spacious with blue curtains on the windows and bed. The walls were left white, and paintings of knights playing ditter adorned the walls. Only a thin carpet covered the floor, likely due to the warm climate. Thankfully, they were visiting before Spring Prayer, so the weather would be mild enough to not need cooling magic circles. The heat was one thing Ferdinand did not miss about Alexandria.</p><p>The first thing Ferdinand did upon entering was have his three retainers search the room while he used a device to check for magic tools. Only those related to daily needs were found, much like Klassenberg. Unlike Klassenberg, however, there appeared to be no hidden means to spy on them, which surprised him. While the men were somewhat straightforward, Dunkelfelger women were crafty little tricksters who lived for manipulation and plotting. He could only assume the castle was constructed without that in mind, and no one wanted to clear all personnel and furnishings from the building to perform an entwickeln just to add spy holes to the guest rooms.</p><p>Once the inspection was done, Ferdinand went to check on Wilfried, letting an invisible Justus loose in the castle. Like last time, the boy was burning off his nervous energy by exercising. As in Ferdinand’s room, the boy’s retainers found nothing amiss. Truthfully, the lack of foul play put Ferdinand on edge more than if they’d found a hundred listening devices. He would act as though their every word was being monitored.</p><p>“What do you suppose their food is like?” Wilfried asked. “I can’t imagine it’s anywhere near as good as ours.”</p><p>Ferdinand held his chin and closed his eyes as he recalled his Academy days when he ate with the Dunkelfelger apprentice knights. Those meals were one of the only times in his youth he could somewhat relax while eating. Veronica might have ruled Ehrenfest with an iron fist, but she had no allies among the Dunkelfelger knights.</p><p>“I recall it being better than Ehrenfest food at the time when I was younger. It was milder than Ahrensbach food but had more seasoning than what our dorm was serving. It wasn’t as flavorful as our current cuisine, but the textures were agreeable.”</p><p>Wilfried crossed his arms and squinted as he thought. “I ate a lot of Ahrensbach food as a kid, but I don’t really recall what Ehrenfest food was like before Rozemyne.” He shook his head. “I feel like we should divide how we tell time by ‘Before Rozemyne’ and ‘After Rozemyne.’”</p><p>Ferdinand chuckled as he chose to ignore the implication of why the boy had had so much Ahrensbach cuisine as a child. “Indeed, she has made quite an impact on our duchy. It is fortunate we found her in the temple.”</p><p>Fortunate yet bizarre. If someone had told him that the little girl he’d read the bible to, who had paid one large gold coin to join the temple, who had nearly killed Bezewanst and made Ferdinand cough up blood with her Crushing would change the face of Ehrenfest and one day be his all goddess, he would have executed them for dabbling in illegal substances. Yet here he was, engaged to that sickly little commoner girl and visiting Dunkelfelger as she spread a new industry across Yurgenschmidt. Thank the gods Sylvester suggested he take refuge in the temple.</p><p>“It’s pretty sad her parents had to put her there, but it ended up turning out alright. I don’t think I ever would have been a priest and gotten so many protections if she hadn’t grown up in the temple.”</p><p>“Likely not, no.”</p><p>“Well, anyway, we’re eating with the aub tonight, right? This place is so different from Klassenberg. We didn’t even see their aub until we met with him three days after we arrived, but Aub Dunkelfelger greeted us on the doorstep.”</p><p>“Yes,” Ferdinand agreed, “but do recall you will be his son-in-law, and they’ll seek any and every opportunity to challenge me to ditter. We have no such connections in Klassenberg.”</p><p>Putting his hands on his hips and furrowing his brow, Wilfried stared up at Ferdinand and asked, “Are you really going to let Rozemyne go on the ditter field without you? I mean, if she’s our treasure, we’ll probably win by default, but…”</p><p>It was a conundrum that had Ferdinand gritting his teeth and balling his hands into fists. There was no weave in which he’d leave her alone on the ditter field, not with how dangerous the older knights were. However, his hands were tied. He couldn’t abandon his duty as knight commander.</p><p>“Why don’t you ask Aub Dunkelfelger if Karstedt or Bonifatius can come to take your place as knight commander while we ditter? I’d bet just about anything that he’d go for it.”</p><p>“I’ll…bring it up at dinner,” Ferdinand muttered. It felt as though whether he participated in the ditter or not, he was still losing somehow. He didn’t like it.</p><p>Clicking his tongue, he went back to his own room and tried to focus on paperwork, but he was too distracted to work at an acceptable speed. He eventually settled on making plans for magic tools that would devastate their opponents. Hopefully, he’d be able to find suitable ingredients.</p><p>Once Rozemyne returned, Ferdinand let Justus back into the room so he could follow him to Rozemyne’s. She smiled upon seeing him and invited him to have a cup of tea with her. Wilfried followed soon after.</p><p>“Their lower city is fascinating,” she said. “First of all, they think this is cold weather even though it's pretty nice out. They were all in coats while my Gutenbergs only had their shirts.</p><p>“Anyway, they had a lot of produce for sale. Way more than I ever saw in Ehrenfest.”</p><p>“When did you ever see stuff like that for sale?” Wilfried asked with an amused grin.</p><p>“When I was establishing my workshop. I had to go talk to the craftspeople myself. That was before I was baptized, so it was easier for me to sneak out of the temple.”</p><p>Wilfried snorted and muttered, “Yeah, I could see you doing that.”</p><p>She sent him a glare and continued, “There was a wide variety, too. I think we’ll be able to gather a lot of useful things here. I would like to get fruits, too, for the Gilberta Company and our chefs to experiment with. Maybe we’ll devise some revolutionary recipes and create a new kind of rinsham.”</p><p>Ferdinand bit back a sigh as she reported on all the products she found and the ways she thought she could turn a profit. Justus, however, was enthralled, nodding along to every word.</p><p>“Anyway, I didn’t see any of our books for sale, and there were only a few places selling our hairpins, though there were some selling simple ones they made locally. Apparently, they just sold out that quickly. They have a much larger noble population, and we’re simply not able to meet that much demand. I would prefer to keep mimeograph printing in our back pocket, but we may have to look at selling the method at the Archduke Conference. While it’s wonderful that there’s demand for our books, if things continue like this, it may just build resentment.”</p><p>Ferdinand tapped his temple as he considered how angry the aubs would be when they found out the ability to print detailed art was not included with their rights to establish printing in their duchies. They would need to discuss this with Elvira and Sylvester.</p><p>“I didn’t find a restaurant like ours, but it’s possible I simply didn’t come across it. The city is huge. I’m guessing Klassenberg’s was smaller since it was underground. Everything is clean, and they have indoor plumbing, too. It really makes me glad we did the entwickeln.</p><p>“One thing that surprised me was that it didn’t really feel like ‘Dunkelfelger.’ The people were lively, but they were nothing like the nobles we’ve met.”</p><p>Ferdinand nodded. “That stands to reason. Commoners can’t play ditter, so they’re completely removed from a large part of their culture.”</p><p>“Dunkelfelger without ditter, huh?” Wilfried pondered out loud. “I can’t even imagine it. I mean, Lady Hannelore doesn’t really like it, but she still participates in morning conditioning, and she’s quick to whip out her shield.”</p><p>“She’s definitely more of a bookworm,” Rozemyne said. “She’ll fit right in with us in Ehrenfest,”</p><p>“You mean she’ll fit in with you?”</p><p>“Am I not part of Ehrenfest? Besides, by the time you get married, there will be a veritable horde of bookworms! I shall personally see to it!”</p><p>“Good grief…” Ferdinand sighed.</p><p>Rozemyne tilted her head and pushed a finger into her soft cheek. “You know, Ferdinand, if you had to go a whole day without sighing, I think you’d die.”</p><p>“It would be easy so long as you were not in my field of vision, and I received no reports about you.”</p><p>Wilfried shook his head. “You’re forgetting about the newly graduated knights and Father.”</p><p>Ferdinand heaved a heavy sigh.</p><p> </p><p>“Report,” Ferdinand commanded after passing Justus a sound-blocking tool.</p><p>“Yes, my lord. To no one’s surprise, they spend a lot of time talking about ditter. The main topic was figuring out a way to get you to play as they are eager to face off against the Lord and Saint of Evil together. There were also many arguments about who would be allowed to represent Dunkelfelger. Heisshitze will only take the field if you do. They have decided to make Lady Hannelore join Ehrenfest to test her compatibility with Wilfried as well as their capability to work together. To balance things out, they plan to field three apprentice knights. They’ve laid out rosters so that no matter how many people our side brings, they will have an equivalent number. I will give you their names and what I could find out about them later as it will take too much time now.”</p><p>“Very well. I’m interested to see which knights they plan to pit against us.”</p><p>Justus nodded with a devious smile. “We know them very well, I assure you.</p><p>“Aub Dunkelfelger is trying to find a way to bring Wilfried here, but his first wife is against it, saying Lady Hannelore wants to go to Ehrenfest. It is common belief that she will win this fight.”</p><p>Ferdinand snorted. “Yes, like any woman from Dunkelfelger.”</p><p>“Quite. Lady Hannelore plans to meet with Brunhilde to decide on the design for Lord Wilfried’s cape.</p><p>“The flammerzung fruit is growing in abundance. The commoners use them to keep fires burning longer at a consistent temperature. Many feybeasts are on the prowl as well, including winfalkes.”</p><p>A wicked grin stretched across Ferdinand’s face. “Most excellent.”</p><p>“Yes, I thought that would please you,” Justus said. “Do allow me to keep one of each of these ingredients.</p><p>“The Sovereign Knight’s Order had permission to investigate Dunkelfelger’s portion of Werkestock, but they haven’t come across the border for some months. Those stationed at the gate said the knights suddenly left a couple of weeks ago and have not returned. Before then, they were largely milling about.</p><p>“There has also been talk of some greenery returning to Ahrensbach along where it borders Dunkelfelger.”</p><p>Ferdinand frowned at that. Had they perhaps pulled in Detlinde’s older sister to supply mana despite her status? Or were they forcing Detlinde to do her duty for a change?</p><p>“Lord Lestilaut has been petitioning his father to ask after the engagement of a girl at the Royal Academy, presumably the one that he’s painted several portraits of in recent weeks. From the description, it appears to be Lady Charlotte.”</p><p>So he’d changed his target. That was fine. He couldn’t marry Charlotte regardless.</p><p>“The milder temperatures this winter may lead to a stronger Lord of Summer this year. The price of eggs may start to rise with the anticipated influx of sugar after the trade deal the aub struck with Ahrensbach. The court chefs have been trying to replicate our desserts that were served in the Royal Academy, but they are unable to reproduce the texture for the ones using gelatin. The aub’s second wife has started turning away food after taking only a couple of bites.”</p><p>He went on to list innocuous tidbits of information before he said, “Now, my lord, shall I tell you about the ditter strategy meeting they held today?”</p><p>Ferdinand’s dark grin reappeared. “Yes, let’s see if Heisshitze has learned to train his mind, not just his body.”</p><p> </p><p>Once again, Ferdinand was unable to escort his fiancée and had to watch Wilfried do it in his place. The aub welcomed them with enthusiastic greetings before motioning for the servants to guide the guests to their seats. They arranged things so that Hannelore and Wilfried could sit together while Ferdinand and Rozemyne sat across from them. Hannelore’s face matched the color of her hair as she offered Wilfried a soft greeting. He had a light blush himself as he returned it.</p><p>“Tomorrow, you will gather your ingredients,” the aub said, “and then you shall brew for the following two days. Then, we shall have our welcoming ditter! We cannot put it off any longer than that as you are scheduled to leave two days after that. I trust this is agreeable to you?”</p><p>“Yes, Aub Dunkelfelger,” Rozemyne replied. “We are ever so grateful for your consideration, and we are looking forward to gathering here in Dunkelfelger. I’m excited to be able to see more of your great land.”</p><p>Wilfried nodded. “Yeah, I want to see the feybeasts. I learned about several that are native to Dunkelfelger, but I’ve never seen them at the Royal Academy.”</p><p>“A young man looking to prove his mettle against mighty foes!” Aub Dunkelfelger laughed. “That’s the spirit, son! You would do well here in Dunkelfelger.”</p><p>Sieglinde smiled at her husband and said, “Yes, but it is fortunate for our daughter that they will be living in Ehrenfest as that is where she wants her light to shine.”</p><p>The aub grunted and then continued outlining their schedule. “We will enter into negotiations after the ditter, and we will do the tour of our city the day after.”</p><p>“Pardon me, but might I request we visit the temple?” Rozemyne asked. “I would so dearly love to see one from another duchy.”</p><p>The aub and his wife made a face. “While we are in the process of cleaning up our temple, it is not ready for visitors of your standing.”</p><p>“Isn’t that all the more reason to see it?” Wilfried asked. “A visit from the aub and a High Bishop from another duchy is sure to make them speed things along.” He looked over at Rozemyne and mouthed, “Especially if the Saint of Evil is coming.”</p><p>Her smile was saccharine and promised a painful death.</p><p>“Hmmm…” The aub crossed his arms as Sieglinde put a troubled hand on her cheek.</p><p>“Father,” Hannelore chirped, “I believe it would be beneficial to have Lord Wilfried and Rozemyne visit the temple even in its current state. They both know how it should be run, so they’ll be able to give us valuable insight that we won’t have a chance to get otherwise.”</p><p>While the aub considered her words, Wilfried leaned closer to her and muttered, “You can drop the ‘lord.’ I am going to marry you, after all.”</p><p>As Hannelore flushed a deeper shade of pink, Aub Dunkelfelger slowly uncrossed his arms and narrowed his eyes. “Slick indeed…”</p><p>Wilfried’s eyebrows knit together in confusion as he looked between the glaring aub and the tittering first wife. Leopold behind him, meanwhile, slowly closed his eyes then looked up to the highest heights for help.</p><p>“Aub Dunkelfelger,” Ferdinand said, drawing his attention away from the poor boy, “if you would forgive me this rudeness, I have a request I would make of you.”</p><p>“Ferdinand!” the aub bellowed. “Come now, speak your request!”</p><p>“I would like permission to summon the vice commander to act in my stead that I might join my fiancée on the field.”</p><p>“DONE!” the aub yelled, jumping to his feet. “I shall go speak with Aub Ehrenfest right this moment!” The knights guarding the aub’s family all started giving each other excited looks and small fist pumps.</p><p>Sieglinde cut into her meat with a slow hand as she said in a calm, almost quiet voice, “Werdekraf.”</p><p>The man sat down and picked up his cutlery again, and the knights stood at attention, their faces straight. “This is a most fortunate day,” the aub said, his voice nearly trembling with the effort to remain calm. “A most fortunate day indeed. Tell me, how many of your guard knights will be joining you?”</p><p>“It depends,” Ferdinand said. “What kind of ditter are we playing? Will Rozemyne be our treasure?”</p><p>The aub scoffed. “With all the feybeasts we have frolicking about? No, this will be a traditional treasure-stealing ditter, as we always have here in Dunkelfelger. I assure you, you will have no issues obtaining an appropriate beast.”</p><p>Ferdinand quickly ran through several scenarios in his mind. His main issue was that aside from Eckhart, Justus, and himself, no one in their retinue had any real experience with treasure-stealing ditter, not like the kind they used to do before the civil war and the subsequent purge. Not to mention, Hannelore was a complete unknown. He didn’t know how to plan for her.</p><p>“While he decides that,” Rozemyne interjected, “might we discuss wagers?”</p><p>“Oho? And what is it you want? Rare ingredients? Publishing rights to another of our books?”</p><p>Rozemyne smiled. “I want to take Clarrisa with me when we leave, and I want to see the orphanage in the temple, no matter what state it’s in. Wilfried?”</p><p>“Are you all going to make demands?!” the aub barked.</p><p>Rozemyne tilted her head. “Why, yes. Are you not going to do the same to us?”</p><p>“Hmm… Very well. What do you desire, son?”</p><p>Wilfried crossed his arms as he considered the question. “Ah! I want to spend the morning after ditter training with your knights!”</p><p>“You wish to train with the Sword of the Zent, do you?” the aub asked. “We do not go light on weaklings or children. You need to be prepared for anything short of death. Are you certain this is what you want?”</p><p>“Absolutely!” Wilfried responded with a grin.</p><p>The aub burst into laughter and waved his hand in the air. “Fine, fine. I’ll even join you.”</p><p>Leopold and Ferdinand both closed their eyes as they prayed for the divine couple to guide Wilfriend’s soul to a peaceful eternal rest.</p><p>“And Ferdinand?”</p><p>“You cannot challenge anyone in Ehrenfest to ditter. Ever.”</p><p>“WHAT?!” the aub barked as the knights’ jaws dropped in horror. “But ditter is… How can you live without ditter? How can we ever come together to discuss politics without testing our mettle against each other?!”</p><p>“Ditter is an expensive endeavor,” Ferdinand said, “and not one Ehrenfest can afford at the present time.”</p><p>Grinding his teeth, Aub Dunkelfelger glared down at the table for a long moment before he looked back up and said, “Five years.”</p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>With a broad smile, the aub said, “Now it’s my turn. You three will accept any and all challenges to ditter made by those of us from Dunkelfelger.”</p><p>Rozemyne’s eyes narrowed. “Does that include Professor Rauffen as well?”</p><p>“Indeed, as he is from Dunkelfelger.”</p><p>As she frowned across the table at Wilfried, he shrugged. It seemed he was fully confident in their victory. When she looked to Ferdinand, he tapped his finger against his temple and whispered to her, “You had best be prepared with your ridiculous highbeast.” Then, he nodded to the aub.</p><p>On the inside, Ferdinand was laughing in triumph. After hearing about their plans from Justus, he knew this was a battle he was guaranteed to win.</p>

<h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
<p>Ferdinand couldn’t remember the last time he’d enjoyed gathering so much. It put him in such a good mood that he could tolerate even Heisshitze’s company. Dunkelfelger’s jungles were rife with useful materials he couldn’t find anywhere else, and many were high in the fire attribute. Wilfried had joined him when he turned his focus to feybeasts, and the boy even gave him most of his share of the materials. Wilfried’s main objective was the hunt itself, not the gathering. Of course, part of that was likely an attempt to impress Hannelore who was accompanying them, but Ferdinand cared little for the reasoning as long as he obtained the materials he sought.</p><p>Rozemyne’s guard knights were equally excited as they slew rare feybeasts and collected ingredients for rejuvenation potions. Clarissa, with the aub’s permission, had been allowed to join them. She was an expert at slicing every last bit of useful material from feybeasts before they turned into feystones, and she guided them to feyplants they might not have otherwise found, which Ferdinand was grateful for.</p><p>Even Rozemyne had thrown herself into gathering after Ferdinand told her about commoners using flammerzung fruit to modulate oven temperatures. Her bag was almost entirely filled with the expensive ingredient, and she’d made him promise to help her germinate it in Ehrenfest. He pretended it would be a burden to research it with her so she would assist him with other similar experiments.</p><p>The party also came across several different feytrees, some of which produced soft wood that could be used for paper. They gathered any fruit or seedlings they found of them and made note of the different species as they took enough branches to make a few test batches of paper.</p><p>Naturally, the burden quickly became too much to bear, so Rozemyne was soon relegated to transporting materials to their rooms in the castle to be sorted by the attendants and three scholars they’d left behind. Heisshitze promised that Dunkelfelger would provide more boxes for their extra luggage if necessary.</p><p>He said this, of course, as he was closely monitoring everything Ferdinand gathered. It seemed he had at least somewhat trained his mind in the past year. The scholar accompanying Heisshitze made several notations on wooden boards, and Ferdinand had no doubt that a team of Dunkelfelger scholars would pour over the list to try to discover what tools he might be making.</p><p>It was a fine tactic, if misguided. Ferdinand focused on gathering items he wanted to use in research. Matthias, Roderick, Muriella, and Hartwind, one of Wilfried’s apprentice scholars, were the ones picking out ingredients they would need for the ditter match in three days. No one paid them any mind as they were mednobles. Even if they did, each was assigned different items to focus on, and when combined with what they were gathering for personal use, it would be nigh impossible to determine what Ferdinand was planning.</p><p>As night fell, the scholars returned to the castle, but the knights prepared to start their hunting anew as nocturnal feybeasts came out to prowl. Clarissa and Heisshitze’s eyes glowed with fervor as they guided them through the jungle, showing them everything from how to track graunagetiers from their dens to which bugs to catch. It seemed the majority of useful insects were different types of kafers and self-luminescent flies, the latter of which were extremely high in both fire and light attributes.</p><p>When at last they returned to the castle, they found the scholars working in the workshop the aub ordered set up, creating rejuvenation potions. Once their current batch was done, they locked the door and turned in for the night with the rest of the Ehrenfest party. Ferdinand, however, stayed up a little longer to send a magic letter to Karstedt. Then, he allowed Justus to help him dress for bed.</p><p>Ferdinand woke early and upon getting dressed and finishing breakfast, he sped into the workshop and got to work. Rozemyne came in around half a bell after he arrived, and she found him stirring a brew with no less than four time-saving magic circles floating above it. She wisely chose not to greet him and instead started preparing the ingredients he had laid out for the next brew.</p><p>Truly, she was an amazing assistant. It pained him that she didn’t enjoy research more.</p><p>As he created tools, she organized them by category then effect. The majority of what he’d made so far were “bullets,” as Rozemyne called them. They slid neatly into tubes that could be used to easily pop them down the chamber of the water gun, vastly decreasing the time between loaded shots. Satisfied with the amount and variety, he moved on to thrown tools. Meanwhile, the other scholars and knights trained by Ferdinand had joined them and were busy preparing potions.</p><p>“Rozemyne, another circle,” Ferdinand said, not lifting his eyes from the liquid he was stirring. Her slender hand danced at the edge of his vision as she stood on a step ladder and drew the third time-saving circle for him. In truth, he could have gotten Justus to do it or even done it himself. However, he’d realized with a jolt of panic during their third round of brewing that he cared more about spending time with Rozemyne while doing what he loved than the brewing itself. Even recognizing this oddity, he couldn’t stop himself from finding tasks for her to do for him when she could have been much better utilized elsewhere.</p><p>It made no sense. Every other action he’d taken had been driven by some form of logic. Even finagling events so that Rozemyne would be engaged to him in the previous weave had been logical to some degree. Having her act as Aub Alexandria with him as her consort benefited both them and the long-neglected duchy.</p><p>This, however, benefited no one. It was pure selfishness. Even with the prospect of infinite ditters hanging over him, he still acted this way. It was shameful, especially since she was only a season away from being physically fourteen. It was still a year away from the age of majority, and yet he was seeking out ways to be close to her not for her sake, like when he took her into a hidden room to give her the physical affection she’d sorely needed, but for his own desire.</p><p>Shameless. Absolutely shameless. Was he turning into an Ewigeliebe?</p><p>Once he finished the tool he was working on, he summoned Justus and told him to set up a station for Rozemyne to start brewing on her own.</p><p>“Oh my, Ferdinand,” she said, placing a hand on her cheek with a worried expression, “has my assistance been lacking in any way?”</p><p>“No, but we are short on time, and your talents are better used increasing our offensive capabilities. There are several magic tools that only you or I have the mana to create multiples of.”</p><p>She accepted his answer with a resigned nod and got to work preparing her ingredients. He felt the loss almost instantly, but he chose to bury the feeling under a mountain of hyper focus. From the corner of his eye, however, he still noticed Justus’ pitying smile.</p><p> </p><p>The day of the welcoming ditter arrived, and with it came Karstedt, carrying a small box. Justus checked its contents and nodded to Ferdinand. Their preparations were complete.</p><p>They gathered at the ditter field with what appeared to be the entire duchy present to watch. On Ehrefest’s side stood Ferdinand, Rozemyne, Wilfried, all their adult and name-sworn guard knights, and Hannelore for a total of fourteen. Dunkelfelger had not only Heisshitze and the three apprentice knights but also Aub Dunkelfelger himself. As he’d exclaimed during the ditter meeting Justus observed, he wouldn’t have missed this chance for all the feystones in Yurgenschmidt. Fortunately, Ferdinand was known for his blank face, so he didn’t have to pretend to be surprised.</p><p>The aub and Ferdinand met in the center of the field to do the customary opening greetings before they went back to their respective teams and waited for the ditter bell. The second it rang, a contingent of knights from each side called forth their highbeasts and flew towards the jungle, Rozemyne among them. Meanwhile, Ferdinand began peppering the remaining knights with bullets that exploded into the thorny vines and sticky traps they’d used during the bride stealing ditter. It mostly served to annoy them and cause minor injuries.</p><p>And distract them.</p><p>In the back, Matthias was laying out magic tools around their base that were flat and roughly the same color as the ground. Ferdinand expected only one would be triggered, but it was better to be over prepared than under.</p><p>Ehrenfest was first to be seen cresting the walls of the arena, and as they brought their treasure to their base, Dunkelfelger appeared.</p><p>Rozemyne’s highbeast, the size she typically used for ferrying the Gutenbergs about, suddenly ballooned as she spun around and sped for the enemy. Ferdinand went to join her, only to have Heisshitze give up on cutting one of his comrades loose from the thorns and intercept him. His sword flashed through the air, and when it made contact with Ferdinand’s, one of his charms retaliated, returning a strike several times as strong. It only clipped Heisshitze’s shoulder, but it left an impressive gash in its wake.</p><p>At the edge of the arena, Rozemyne’s gargantuan pandabus slammed into the knights and aub who had used their shields to protect their treasure. They were pushed back by a significant margin, and three of Rozemyne’s charms activated. As they worked to block the nigh deadly blows, she pulled out her water gun and fired an electrocuting shot at their feybeast. While it did cause some damage, it mostly served to anger it, and it began thrashing about in an attempt to attack her. As she turned back around to head for their base, she threw out yellow bands of light and wrapped up two of the knights, dragging them with her until she dropped them just outside the field where they struggled to free themselves.</p><p>She landed her bus in the center of the base and stepped out as the knights loaded the treasure inside. She left a magic tool inside to keep it active and began to fire smoke bombs down range. These proved no more than a minor inconvenience as a quick spell could clear the air. While they were focused on that, however, she darted down the field with enhancement magic, chanting a prayer. She’d timed it just right so that when the knights landed with their treasure, a yellow dome appeared around them. The knights along with their large feybeast were trapped inside the reverse shield, meaning they had to either weaken their treasure to the point of submission or weather its strong attacks. When the other knights tried to enter, they were thrown back. Nearly half of the Dunkelfelgarians were now incapacitated, at least for the moment.</p><p>The Dunkelfelger knights, realizing there was nothing more they could do, charged, but Angelica was quicker. She’d grabbed Rozemyne and streaked to their base, leaving her comrades to block the enemy. The aub flew just behind them, and once the majority of the knights were engaged, he made a beeline for Wilfried. Hannelore intercepted, but her father had trained against her before and only paused a moment to ensure her shield was in place before he struck her hard enough to knock her aside. Wilfried used all the enhancement magic at his disposal to flee as he pulled a bow, turning behind him to shoot at the aub, though it did little against the man’s shield. It didn’t take long for the aub to catch up and slam his lance down on him. Wilfried blocked it with his shield enhanced with the magic circle from Schutzaria’s divine instrument, so he was only knocked back a short ways. Wilfried used it to add to his momentum as he continued to fly as fast as he could away from the aub.</p><p>While Matthias, Laurenz, Angelica, and Alexis were holding off two of the adult knights, Eckhart, Cornelius, Leonre, and two of Wilfried’s guard knights held off the other four. Lamprecht stayed to guard Rozemyne, who’d retreated back into her highbeast.</p><p>Heisshitze had finally gone through all of Ferdinand’s charms, and while he was certainly worse for wear, he still put up enough of a fight to keep Ferdinand engaged. Ferdinand had yet to have time to pull any magic tools, but the fight itself wasn’t anywhere near as difficult as the one he’d had in the previous weave after he’d gone soft from so many years in the temple.</p><p>Wilfried, too, had taken quite a bit of damage from the aub, though he kept fighting as though he felt none of the pain. He had slowed significantly from the start of the ditter, and it seemed Aub Dunkelfelger had gotten tired of toying with him. He summoned Leidenschaft’s spear, fully charged, and slammed it into Wilfried’s shield, sending him flying back until he tumbled along the ground, landing behind Ehrenfest’s base.</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger, finally free of distractions, moved to end the game. Rozemnyne’s highbeast was large, but that didn’t matter. He wrapped it in bands of light and yanked it up into the air, pulling her along with it out of the base. It was at this point that the Ehrenfest knights began creating openings for each other to slip on face masks.</p><p>“HA!” he bellowed. “It was an excellent ditter, but…” He narrowed his eyes, obviously realizing Sieglinde had not called the match. It was then that he noticed at the bottom of Rozemyne’s highbeast was an open hatch. He looked down to where Lamprecht guarded the feybeast and Hannelore, who was gripping her courtship necklace. The domed shield appeared, which should have ended the match as the feybeast would be thrown out.</p><p>Except it was asleep.</p><p>He charged at the dome, filling his lance with enough mana to overwhelm it. An explosion threw him back before he could land the blow, however. A heartbeat after, Rozemyne opened fire on the closest knights, causing gray clouds of paralytic gas to bloom around them. She then immediately shot at the knights down field as she dropped the reverse Wind shield. They all crumpled within moments.</p><p>The aub ignored the battle behind him and prepared to attack the crackling dome protecting Ehrenfest’s feybeast again when a flash of light caused him to whip his head up. Wilfried was sitting on his highbeast at eye level with the aub, holding Liedenshaft’s spear, sparking with mana. He threw it at Aub Dunkelfelger, who smiled as he lifted his shield to block it.</p><p>His smile dropped as the spear split in four. He only managed to block three. The remaining one flew to the other end of the field. The impact was less impressive than one might have expected, but the boy’s mana was split four ways, and he’d spent quite a lot keeping the aub distracted. While it wasn’t powerful enough to cause any permanent damage to the paralyzed knights, it was enough to deal the killing blow to the weakened feybeast.</p><p>Sieglinde called the end of the match, and Heisshitze finally stopped his flurry of attacks, his shocked gaze taking in the remnants of the battle. The plan to keep the Lord of Evil out of the fight had worked, but Aub Dunkelfelger’s insistence on testing his future son-in-law had removed their most powerful piece from the board as well. Having Wilfried focus on running from the aub only goaded the man to keep chasing him.</p><p>After Rozemyne’s first ditter, they were more than familiar with her highbeast gambit and were prepared for it, knowing that they couldn’t rely on Schutzaria’s shield to protect the feybeast as it would naturally hold malice against the caster. Having Hannelore hide in the back of the highbeast over the “emergency exit” had guaranteed them a little extra time, which Wilfried used to prepare his spear. His weakened state was critical as it was their failsafe to ensure none of the knights died.</p><p>By the time Ferdinand had reached Rozemyne, the Dunkelfelger knights were already mostly recovered from the paralytic. Making it last any longer than a few moments risked killing them. This time, Rozemyne healed everyone by herself as Wilfried needed it worse than nearly anyone, and he was all but drained of mana.</p><p>While his physical wounds were healed, it took the aub several moments to recover from the mental blow. “You give me one of the most excellent games of ditter I’ve played since my Academy days, and then you deny me the pleasure of experiencing more for five years. You truly are the Lord and Saint of Evil. I have never felt a loss so bitterly in all my life.” The Dunkelfelger knights looked just as heartbroken. Shaking his head, the aub commanded all the men to go to the ditter hall where they would recreate the battle with a gewinnen board.</p><p>As they left, Laurenz snorted and said, “Is it just me, or did it sound less like he was talking about ditter and more like he was talking about winter?”</p><p>Matthias smacked him on the back of the head.</p>

<p>Aub Dunkelfelger was in much better spirits by the time negotiations began. Apparently, recreating the game and discussing Ehrenfest’s tactics had lit the fire of his excitement once again. Things proceeded smoothly with the terms aligning with what was discussed at the Archduke Conference, their main purpose being deciding on details. Rozemyne also brought up hand pumps and handled the pre-negotiations that Sylvester would be in charge of finalizing in a few weeks’ time.</p><p>By the time the discussion wrapped up, they needed to prepare for dinner, which was a feast that included the guests, the aub’s family, and all who took part in the ditter. The tables were laden with food, and the vize poured freely. People milled about, their attendants carrying their lord’s or lady’s plates to their next destination. It was the first time Lestilaut joined them as he’d been away from the city completing a task for the archduke.</p><p>The young man took the first opportunity to accuse Rozemyne of employing dirty tricks unbecoming of a saint, to which half the men around him responded, “But not the Saint of Evil!”</p><p>“A fitting name indeed,” Lestilaut grimaced, which earned a smug smirk from Ferdinand.</p><p>“Son!” Aub Dunkelfelger boomed as he slapped a hand on his shoulder. “As I’ve said before, you are too narrow-minded! Ditter is about winning, whatever the means! Clever tacticians make for worthy opponents, and you would do well to learn from them!</p><p>“Listen here!” The aub took a long draw from his glass before he continued. “She made a Wind shield that trapped our people inside with the feybeast! Did you even know such a thing was possible? Marvelous! Absolutely marvelous! Never have I seen a tactic that both incapacitated nearly half of the enemy’s numbers and forced them to beat their own treasure until its paw touched the towering staircase!”</p><p>Several hands came out of nowhere to slap Ferdinand on the back and shoulders as their owners yelled variations of, “A saint worthy of the Lord of Evil!” and “As expected of your fiancée!” Rozemyne, naturally, basked in the praise, and it almost brought a smile to his lips to see how pleased she was.</p><p>Except his annoyance at these fools continually hitting him was overshadowing it by a fair margin.</p><p>“Ah, but my son-in-law!” the aub continued. “Now that was a marvel! He produced not one, not two, but four of Leidenschaft’s spears!”</p><p>“And that was after facing off against you the entire game!” Heisshitze added, practically bouncing with excitement.</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger rubbed his chin. “I don’t know if I would call what he did ‘facing off,’ exactly.”</p><p>“Maybe not from your perspective,” Rozemyne said, “but he did exactly what he was supposed to do - keep you distracted until your treasure was weakened and his mana dropped to a certain point.”</p><p>The aub’s eyes widened. “WHAT?! So all that running was part of the plan? He was toying with me?!”</p><p>Ferdinand felt a wave of vindication. At least he hadn’t been the only one played by the boy.</p><p>“Do give yourself some credit,” Rozemyne said, a wicked glint in her eye and a polite smile on her lips. “Wilfried had the worst injuries out of anyone, and that includes the knights who were trapped with the feybeast and took one of Leidenschaft’s spears to the face.”</p><p>Ferdinand caught her eye and gave her a look that said, You reveal the man’s future son-in-law played him like a harspiel and then point out in front of his men that he bullied a thirteen-year-old. Well done.</p><p>Even the silent praise was enough to tinge her cheeks with color as her smile became genuine.</p><p>Rubbing his chin again, Aub Dunkelfelger looked around with furrowed brows. “Now where is this son-in-law of mine? Ah, of course. He’s with my Hannelore. Who’s that girl standing with them?”</p><p>Ferdinand glanced over and said, “Brunhilde. She was his first fiancée before the royal order.”</p><p>“Hmmm…” The aub rubbed his chin and muttered, “This bears investigating.” Without another word, he headed off to terrorize the children. Rozemyne followed, her curiosity getting the better of her. Ferdinand watched as she introduced the aub to her attendant. The man grinned and slapped Wilfried on the shoulder hard enough to make him wince. Whatever the man said after the third “good-natured” smack caused the boy’s jaw to drop as his face drained of color. Hannelore’s, however, bloomed in Geduldh’s noble color as she gasped indignantly while Brunhilde brought a hand to her lips as she gave an amused chuckle. Rozemyne placed a hand on her cheek and gave a concerned look to her brother, though her eyes danced with amusement.</p><p>Heisshitze, also watching the exchange, laughed as he motioned for a servant to refill Ferdinand’s glass. “Ah, the joys of summer. Looks like our aub just enlightened your nephew on the perks of having a second wife.”</p><p>Given Brunhilde’s reaction, he seriously doubted that.</p><p>The buffoon, however, was unperturbed by reality. “He’s only thirteen, and he’s already beaten you, eh? How much longer until we can have that conversation with you?”</p><p>Ferdinand fought down the initial wave of rage at the question and instead chose to reach for a topic guaranteed to catch the fool’s interest. “Did you truly expect your plan to keep me occupied to succeed? I see you have yet to train your mind as well as your body if you believed I would not anticipate such a plot and plan for it.”</p><p>“Maybe,” he shrugged, “but I see you’ve finally started training your body properly! Your new role as knight commander has done wonders for your conditioning! Why, at our next ditter, I’ll—“ Heisshitze froze and then gave a long, forlorn sigh. “I suppose there won’t be a next one. Not for another five years.”</p><p>“Indeed.”</p><p>“Unless…” The man wiggled his eyebrows at him. “You challenge us.”</p><p>“In what weave would I ever approach you for ditter?”</p><p>Heisshitze shrugged. “You’ve challenged me once already. I bet I could make you do it again.”</p><p>“Fool.”</p><p>“We’ll see who the fool is at the next Interduchy Tournament!” Heisshitze laughed.</p><p>Ferdinand was going to make him eat those words.</p><p> </p><p>The next morning was spent in relative bliss as Ferdinand went through the items he’d gathered and made plans for them. He was especially interested in attempting to germinate the rarer specimens with Rozemyne’s blessings. He’d only bought so much goodwill from her, however, by promising to assist her with the flammerzung fruit, so he had to be selective.</p><p>She, meanwhile, had spent her morning in the lower city discussing the previous night’s negotiations with her Gutenbergs and did not return until after third bell.</p><p>Just before lunch, someone began pounding on one of the other doors, and Ferdinand darted into the hall, schtappe out, to find Alexis standing outside Rozemyne’s room with his fist raised as Lamprecht supported a bleeding but grinning Wilfried.</p><p>When Rihyarda opened the door, she gasped and called out to Rozemyne, who ushered them inside. Ferdinand followed them. Rozemyne wasted no time in granting her brother first Flutrane’s then Heilschmerz’s blessings, and as his wounds disappeared, his grin broadened.</p><p>“Aub Dunkelfelger didn’t hold back, did he?” Rozemyne asked with a huff. “You should have known better than to bait him like that, Wilfried!”</p><p>“Bait him?” he asked. “I just wanted to train with the best knights in the country, and man, did I learn a lot!”</p><p>“By getting beaten up?” Rozemyne asked.</p><p>Wilfried scoffed as Lamprecht shook his head. “Lord Wilfried held his own against his first several opponents. It wasn’t until he started training against the older, more experienced knights that he started taking more noticeable wounds.”</p><p>“Why did you not just take a potion?” Ferdinand asked.</p><p>“I did!” Wilfried protested. “But you can only take so many a day, right? I went through three before Aub Dunkelfelger challenged me, so I couldn’t take anymore after that.”</p><p>Rihyarda sighed and glared down at the boy. “And what are you so happy about after having been beaten so thoroughly by your future father-in-law?”</p><p>His and all his guard knights’ grinned in satisfaction. “I landed three whole blows on him.”</p><p>“Three?!” Eckhart and Ferdinand gasped.</p><p>He gave a self-satisfied chuckle. “Impressive, right?”</p><p>“Lord Wilfried,” Leopold said, his eyes closed as though he were getting a headache, “you’ve failed to mention that your ‘impressive’ display has reignited the aub’s desire to have you marry into Dunkelfelger.”</p><p>“That’s not a big deal,” Wilfried shrugged. “I have to make a good-faith effort to be Aub Ehrenfest, and I’ll already be married to Brunhilde before I can marry Hannelore, so it doesn’t matter either way, does it? Besides, Lady Sieglinde is against it, and if it’s one thing I’ve learned about Dunkelfelger women, it’s that they always win.” He shook his head. “Always.”</p><p>“Oh?” Rozemyne asked as Brunhilde covered her mouth to hide her giggle. “And how did you learn this valuable lesson, Dear Brother?”</p><p>His face flushed as Leopold pressed his palm into his face with a defeated sigh. Lamprecht chuckled, Alexis coughed, and Brunhilde nearly lost her composure. “D-ditter!” Wilfried stammered. “It was ditter!”</p><p>“Brunhilde,” Rozemyne said, “as your lady, I order you to tell me what he’s hiding.”</p><p>“Brunhilde!”</p><p>The attendant gave him a pitying look through her mirth as she said, “I apologize, but she is my lady.” Apparently, Wilfried had made an off-handed comment after the bride-taking ditter that Clarissa’s proposal only worked because Hartmut was so weak. Hannelore had apparently made it her mission to prove the strength of Dunkelfelger women and had proceeded to knock him to the ground and hold him at knifepoint no less than times during the two days of frantic brewing. Ferdinand was mildly impressed considering the amount of training the girl probably endured to ensure she could pull off such a feat, especially against an opponent who would become alert after the first, if not second, assault.</p><p>“And I imagine that was why he risked life and limb to get three hits on Aub Dunkelfelger,” Brunhilde said. “One for each tackle.”</p><p>“Hey! It wasn’t my idea!” Wilfried said as he lifted his red face from where he’d been holding it in his hands. “He’s the one who said I had to do it!”</p><p>“So that’s what the aub was talking about yesterday,” Rozemyne said. “I was wondering what he meant when he said something about three-for-three.”</p><p>With a sigh, Ferdinand tapped his temple and said, “You were too easily baited, Wilfried. That’s unbecoming of a knight commander.”</p><p>“Huh? But you were the easiest one of all of us to bait. All they had to do was get Rozemyne to agree to play ditter, and by the end of the day, you’d found a way to shirk your duty as knight commander so you could play, just like they wanted.”</p><p>His face immediately paled as those in the room gave a collective shiver, save Elvira whose eyes were aflame as her hand blurred across her diptych. The boy was saved from the impending lecture or violence - Ferdinand wasn’t sure which - by Heisshitze’s timely arrival as he came to escort them to lunch. After the meal, they would start the grand tour of the city, meaning Ferdinand had plenty of time to plan a new training regimen for the future knight commander.</p><p>And, of course, have Justus prepare a letter to Sylvester, detailing everything Brunhilde had shared that morning. Ferdinand would send it later that night.</p><p>The city was just as massive as Rozemyne had said, with shops spreading even into the noble’s quarter, their entrances busy with lay- and mednobles passing through. While there were an impressive number of carriages on those roads, even more filled the congested streets of the lower city. Rozemyne pulled up next to Ferdinand’s highbeast and said they should have Sylvester shill the improved spring suspension system for commoner carriages at the Archduke Conference.</p><p>“Rozemyne,” he sighed, “should you not limit the number of revolutionary ideas leaving our duchy to at most three a year? You’re bringing paper-making and printing to these duchies already, and you’ve made plans to spread handpumps soon. There’s a fine line between medicine and poison.”</p><p>“Fine, we’ll save it for next year, then,” she said. “Maybe we can do spring-loaded mattresses at the same time. I should talk to the Gilberta Company about finding someone to do pillow tops. That’ll make them even more comfortable.”</p><p>More comfortable than they already were? “Indeed,” he agreed. “Make that a priority when we return.”</p><p>She gave him a knowing look, which he answered with a glare.</p><p>The city was a marvel to look at from above, especially as the size made the temple appear miniature, even though it was the same size as Ehrenfest’s. When they landed at the house of the gods, they were greeted by the High Priest and several blue robes with a smattering of gray robes in the back. Once the customary exchanges were out of the way, they led them through the noble’s section to a large meeting room where the High Bishop waited. They finished their greetings again, and Rozemyne stepped forward and said, “I thank you ever so much for agreeing to let us see your temple. As High Bishop of Ehrenfest’s temple, I understand this is a busy time for you.”</p><p>The High Bishop had evidently been informed of Ehrenfest’s peculiar arrangement as he didn’t act at all surprised to see a noble claim such an affiliation with the temple. Instead, he simply had his grays serve tea and passable sweets as he, Rozemyne, and Wilfried discussed the various goings on of the Dunkelfelger temple. Aub Dunkelfelger watched on with sharp eyes as his scholars took several notes.</p><p>“I see our customs are similar in many ways,” Rozemyne said. “Of course, we share significant differences as well. For one, the archduke’s children all serve in the temple, as my brother, a priest, can attest.”</p><p>“I have heard from the aub’s men that this has granted Ehrenfest more bountiful harvests,” the High Bishop said with a soft smile. “It is heartening to hear other duchies understand the importance of the temple.”</p><p>“Indeed,” she agreed. “Ah, do forgive me, but our time is short. Shall we head to the orphanage?”</p><p>“Th-the orphanage?” the bishop asked, his face turning as pale as his robes. It seemed the aub had agreed to Rozemyne’s request to leave that tidbit a secret. “Would you not prefer to see the divine instruments or–”</p><p>“No, my siblings and I can make them. We have no need to see them,” she said with a flippant wave of her hand.</p><p>“M-m-make…?”</p><p>“Aub Dunkelfelger, perhaps one of the gray priests here knows the way to the orphanage?”</p><p>At her prompting, the aub ordered the closest one to lead them to their destination as the High Bishop offered ever-increasingly frantic excuses and pleas to keep them on the noble’s side of the temple. Unfortunately for him, Rozemyne already had her mind set, and Ferdinand was not going to step in the way of this rampage.</p><p>When they arrived at the doors of the orphanage, the gray priest looked over his shoulder nervously and said, “Perhaps the women and children…”</p><p>“Open it,” the aub ordered, and the young man obeyed.</p><p>The inside was not as bad as Ferdinand had been expecting. It was as clean as the rest of the temple, though the children were somewhat underfed. When they saw the visitors, several of the older grays pushed the younger ones back behind them as others, the willing sacrifices, stepped forward, their faces grim for the barest hint of a moment before they smiled placidly and knelt. “How can we be of service to our lords and ladies today?” the young man in the front asked.</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger glared around the room as Hannelore grabbed Wilfried’s arm to keep him from charging down the hall to go find the High Bishop again.</p><p>“What is this?” the aub asked.</p><p>“It is the orphanage, my lord,” the man answered. “If you are here for flowers, then any of us here–”</p><p>“Why are there still flowers in the temple?” he growled.</p><p>All of the grays paled, but Rozemyne stepped forward and asked, “Aub Dunkelfelger, I assume it is the practice you thought done away with, not the people themselves?”</p><p>“Of course!” he said. “They were told in no uncertain terms to stop practicing such filth. Tell me, have you received visitors recently seeking flowers?”</p><p>The man lowered his head. “...Yes, my lord.”</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger’s brows furrowed deeper as he crossed his arms. “From today onward, you shall not offer these services again.”</p><p>“With all due respect,” Wilfried said with a noticeable growl in his voice, “they won’t be able to turn down any blue robes or nobles who come seeking flowers. I heard from our grays that it was like that even in our own temple until my sister became High Bishop. Even now, there are some blues who use their gray attendants in such a manner, but Rozemyne has ensured that they are at least willing.”</p><p>“So even Ehrenfest’s temple has its issues, huh?” the aub asked.</p><p>Rozemyne’s eyes flitted over to where the other group of older grays were trying to shield the young ones from sight. When Ferdinand’s gaze fell upon them, a handful of the boys and girls started to tremble. It turned his stomach, thinking of the beasts who would seek winter with ones just recently released from Wiegemilch’s embrace. It certainly had happened in Ehrenfest’s temple during his tenure there, but as ashamed as he was to admit it, he chose to ignore it as he could do nothing while under the purview of the previous High Bishop. “Forgive me,” Rozemyne said, “but I don’t see any children below baptismal age. Where are they?”</p><p>Silence fell over the room.</p><p>“Well?” the aub prompted.</p><p>“Th-they’re in the basement,” the man answered.</p><p>“I see,” Rozemyne said. “What is your name?”</p><p>“Finn, my lady.”</p><p>“Finn, please take me to the children protected by Wiegemilch.”</p><p>Ferdinand stepped forward. “Rozemyne, Wilfried and I will go.”</p><p>“But…”</p><p>He pleaded with his eyes for her to rely on him. Even now, it pained him that he’d been unable to do nothing as the children suffered, and that she’d had to see such a sight. As much as she claimed she was motivated by the selfish desire to protect her reading time, she wouldn’t have lifted a finger if her heart hadn’t been moved. She was indeed selfish, but not as much as she liked to pretend.</p><p>After sharing a long look with him, she nodded. “Very well. Wilfried?”</p><p>“On it,” he said, slipping out of Hannelore’s grasp as he followed Ferdinand and Finn to the lower floor.</p><p>The smell hit Ferdinand the moment the door cracked open, and Wilfried gagged. It was an excess of human filth, unwashed bodies, and rot. The sound of buzzing flies filled the air as he stepped into the squalid chamber. When Wilfried whipped out his schtappe to waschen their surroundings, Ferdinand stopped him. “It may kill the weaker ones,” he said, causing the boy to pale as he put his schtappe away.</p><p>There were perhaps a couple dozen children in total, most of whom were between the ages of three and six. There were only a handful of toddlers and three babies, though Ferdinand wondered if the youngest ones would survive the week. None wore clothing, and any pallets that remained for them to sleep on were more mold and filth than straw.</p><p>“H-how could this…?” Wilfried asked.</p><p>“This is exactly the state Rozemyne found our orphanage in,” Ferdinand said, “except the infants had already perished.”</p><p>Wilfried hissed as he closed his eyes and turned away. “Where are the divine gifts?”</p><p>“Forgive me, my lord,” Finn said, “but we lost several blue priests a number of years ago, and we’ve had few to take their place. There simply isn’t enough to feed everyone.”</p><p>“What nonsense,” Wilfried spat, causing Finn to cower back in fear.</p><p>Ferdinand shook his head. “Few blues have the same access to the funds archduke candidates have, and do recall that our orphanage is self-sufficient because of the workshop.”</p><p>“You don’t think…?”</p><p>He sighed. “Yes, I certainly do.”</p><p>With a resigned sigh, Wilfried said, “Well, anything’s better than this, and if anyone can make Aub Dunkelfelger go for it, it’s Rozemyne.”</p><p>“Indeed. Finn, take us back.”</p><p>They went back up the stairs and found Rozemyne standing before one of the long tables where she’d gotten the orphans to sit. She was interviewing them about their daily schedules, their education, their meals, and so forth with Roderick taking notes behind her. “Oh, Ferdinand, Wilfried!” she said as they emerged from the stairwell. “What did you find?”</p><p>His grim look told her everything, and Aub Dunkelfelger glared at Wilfried, who approached him and gave him the long explanation.</p><p>The aub looked pained but shook his head. “I’m afraid there’s not much I can do,” he said. “We cannot divert funding to the orphanage and do nothing for the lay- or mednobles.”</p><p>“What if we could make the orphanage self-sufficient and take steps to remedy the food shortage without the duchy spending a single copper?” Rozemyne asked.</p><p>At the aub’s prompting, she explained the system she put in place in Ehrenfest’s temple, including the education plans, the adjustments with making soup, and the workshop in the basement of the boys’ building.</p><p>“Hmm… I see. Let us return to talk about this in detail. All of you, clean the children and the basement. Anything that puts a look like that on my future son-in-law’s face needs to be addressed immediately.”</p><p>After they got back to the castle and were settled in a meeting room, Rozemyne detailed everything for the aub, from the costs associated with starting the workshop to the methods used to extend food supplies. “I would also suggest appointing someone from the archducal family to the role of High Bishop, but that is of course only my attempt at playing Anhaltung.”</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger didn’t seem convinced on the last point but considered everything else she said. “We will need someone to come here to train the gray-robed priests in making paper. Our paper craftsmen won’t arrive in Ehrenfest until summer, and getting them to enter the temple upon their return in autumn, even with reforms…”</p><p>Holding a troubled hand to her cheek, Rozemyne said, “While I would recommend temporarily hiring my gray-robed attendants, I cannot send them to a place where they will be unprotected.”</p><p>“Aub Dunkelfelger, if I may?”</p><p>The aub turned to Heisshitze, who had stepped forward. “Speak.”</p><p>“I would be willing to guard the Saint of Evil’s attendants to and from Ehrenfest as well as the entire time they are here, if you would allow it.”</p><p>“Me, too!”</p><p>“I would as well!”</p><p>Rozemyne smiled at the three men and said, “I imagine it will be very difficult indeed for any harm to come to anyone in the orphanage with such fine knights present. That said, as the High Bishop, I have the authority to authorize my gray priests to travel outside the temple, but only Aub Ehrenfest can allow them to leave the duchy. If you would indeed like to hire them, please discuss it with him at the Archduke Conference.”</p><p>The aub hummed to himself as he rubbed his chin. “Very well. I shall take this matter into consideration. Now, I would speak with you, Wilfried, and Ferdinand about your duties at the temple. Before I can make any decisions regarding my family, I would like to know more of what is expected of your roles.”</p><p>They talked through the rest of the afternoon, pausing to eat dinner, and then continued well into the evening with Lestilaut and Sieglinde joining them. When they finished, Aub Dunkelfelger said, “You’ve given me and my family much to consider. Before you turn in for the night… Hannelore?”</p><p>The girl looked between her parents, nodded, and then turned to face Wilfried with a gentle smile. Her attendant handed her a board which she touched all over to prove it wasn’t poisoned before she slid it over to him, face down. With some trepidation, he picked it up, and when Wilfried’s eyes landed on what was inscribed on it, they widened. “This is…”</p><p>Hannelore nodded. “It’s a magic circle granted only to those recognized by Aub Dunkelfelger. I’ll embroider it on the inside of your cape so that no one else can see it, but above it will be this symbol.”</p><p>Thanks to the angle, Ferdinand couldn’t see the circle, likely by design, and he was cursing himself for not having Justus attend under the shroud of Verbergen so he could look over the boy’s shoulder.</p><p>Wilfried smirked upon seeing the symbol and said, “That’s going to turn a few heads, having an eagle on my cape. I’ll wear it with pride.” He passed the board back to Hannelore, making sure not to show the design to anyone, and then bowed his head to the aub. “I thank you for this honor.”</p><p>“Nonsense! You earned it! Besides, you’ll need the extra protection at your wedding ditter!”</p><p>“My wedding…what?”</p><p>“Wedding ditter!” the aub repeated. “A friendly match between father-in-law and son-in-law! Let's see how many spears you can make by then!” He then eyed Ferdinand and said, “The wedding will be six years away at the earliest, so it’s well outside the timeframe for your embargo on challenges.”</p><p>Ferdinand shrugged. It didn’t matter to him what nonsense they pulled Wilfried into. He’d be consort in Alexandria by then. He was more concerned with trying to figure out how to get his eyes on that magic circle.</p><p>By the time they arrived back in Ehrenfest, Ferdinand still hadn’t thought of a plan to see it.</p>

<p>Norbert greeted the Ehrenfest party as they landed at the castle. While Rozemyne was seeing off her Gutenbergs and waiting for her highbeast to be unloaded, Wilfried was told to go to the aub’s office immediately. Clarissa, meanwhile, was following Roderick around to learn how to serve as a scholar for Rozemyne. She would train under Hartmut at the temple when they left for Drewanchel, much to her dismay.</p><p>Ferdinand took the opportunity to go to the training grounds to check in on how things were progressing. Karstedt had returned the morning after the ditter, and he’d apparently brought the story back with him because when Ferdinand arrived, nearly all training ceased as the knights rushed him, flooding him with questions. He eventually got them to return to their training by first assuring them that the story they’d gotten from Karstedt was accurate and then by threatening them with increased reps if they didn’t get out of his face. Overall, however, it seemed things were progressing smoothly.</p><p>He eventually decided to head to Sylvester's office, knowing he had to report, and he bumped into Wilfried in the hall.</p><p>“Uncle, you traitor!” he spat, his face red. “You told Father about Hannelore and Aub Dunkelfelger!”</p><p>Ferdinand smirked. “I gave the aub accurate reports, as is my duty. I wouldn’t want anyone accusing me of shirking it, after all.”</p><p>Wilfried ground his teeth, but he said nothing as he stepped around him and retreated down the hall. When he got to the aub’s office, he found Sylvester with his head on his desk, his fist pounding against its surface as he laughed.</p><p>“Sylvester?”</p><p>He turned his head just enough to see his younger brother, tears dotting the corners of his eyes. “Aaaah! She knocked him down three times! THREE TIMES!”</p><p>“I know,” Ferdinand sighed. “I was the one who reported it to you.”</p><p>He took a seat as his older brother worked to compose himself. Eventually, Sylvester was able to sit up, and he asked, “You have anything for me?”</p><p>Ferdinand gave him a rundown of what was discussed in Dunkelfelger.</p><p>“So I’m going to guess it’s safe to assume I’ll be talking about hand pumps with Drewanchel as well. I wasn’t planning on negotiating over lending out gray robes, though, especially ones central to the Rozemyne workshop. How well do you trust Heisshitze?”</p><p>Ferdinand shrugged. “Well enough, but given what the gray priests know of Rozemyne, I would almost suggest you send Wilfried for a long stay to train and help clean up their temple simply to ensure there is always adequate protection.”</p><p>“That’s what worries me the most,” Sylvester said. “I know they haven’t slipped up, even with a new High Priest, but…”</p><p>Ferdinand didn’t think anything would make those involved with the workshop talk, but that didn’t mean harm couldn’t come to them. If that happened, he couldn’t predict what Rozemyne would do.</p><p>“I’ll see about at least sending some of our knights. They can be rotated out, maybe, so they don’t fall behind on training.”</p><p>“The Knight’s Order will move as you command.”</p><p>After a brief casual talk, Ferdinand left to return to his rooms to get some work done and prepare. Their stay in Drewnachel would be much shorter, but it would be no less perilous.</p><p> </p><p>They arrived at Drewanchel’s border gate the following afternoon and were escorted to their castle. There was a certain air about the duchy that left the impression that even the countryside was more scientifically advanced than the rest of Yurgenschmidt, though Ferdinand knew that wasn’t truly the case. Still, this was the duchy that pioneered the plumbing system nobles enjoyed in Ehrenfest some eighty years ago, so perhaps their farming villages were hiding advancements under their common roofs.</p><p>Two of the many archduke candidates greeted them, one of which was Wilfried’s friend Ortwin. The other was a boy named Alaric who had just finished his first term at the Royal Academy. Rozemyne caught Ferdinand’s eye, and her expression said, <em>A suitor for Charlotte then?</em></p><p>He nodded. If the boy were competent enough to be adopted by the aub and had an agreeable personality, he saw no reason to turn him away at this juncture, and he silently communicated as much to his fiancée. She gave a slight shrug but continued to smile politely as their items were unloaded from her highbeast and teleported to their rooms. As always, she then requested escort to the lower city, and five Drewanchel knights guided her to where her Gutenbergs would be staying.</p><p>This time, when Ferdinand and his aides inspected the first chamber, they found over fifty magic tools not related to daily use, and at least half were listening devices. There were also hidden magic circles that would transmit sound through stone. Ferdinand made a point of copying them down before deactivating them. On and under the bed, they found modified circles for Schlaftraum’s blessing, meant to lull the victim into a deeper sleep. He made note of their modifications and added the life element to them, utterly wrecking them.</p><p>He also dusted the feystones of each of the tools. If Drewanchel thought to obtain free information, then they shouldn’t begrudge him free materials in return. A couple caught his eye, so he set them aside to take apart later that night. The rest he gave to Janrik to dispose of. Nobody would even be able to complain as they couldn’t admit to planting spying devices in their guests’ rooms.</p><p>When he went to check on Wilfried, he was unsurprised to see Ortwin and his adoptive brother there. The older boys were engaged in a game of gewinnen that Wilfried was dominating while Alaric watched on with fascination. A single look at Leopold and Lamprecht confirmed they knew they were being monitored.</p><p>The boys acknowledged his presence, but he let them go back to the game before excusing himself to go check on Rozemyne’s room. He helped her scholars and attendants sweep the room again, but they’d managed to find everything. His only contribution was to destroy or deactivate the devices and magic circles. He then signaled for them to continue as though they were being monitored and then went back to his chambers. When Rozemyne returned, so did Justus, and they went to see her. The nod she gave him when he entered said she understood they were under surveillance.</p><p>“Their lower city is quite advanced, even when compared to Klassenberg,” she said after greeting him, going over a few of the innovations she’d noticed. It simply seemed they were on par with noble estates. It made Ferdinand wonder if Drewanchel used its lower city as test subjects.</p><p>A knock came at the door, and Cornelius opened it to reveal one of Ortwin’s attendants, who was there to escort them to dinner. Wilfried and the two archduke candidates joined them on their trek to the dining hall. While the aub would not be joining them this time, they still were still eating with members of the archducal family. Wilfried and Ortwin were visibly excited to be seeing each other outside of the Royal Academy, but their conversation was still careful. Rozemyne kept Alaric engaged in conversation, prying every bit of information she could out of him.</p><p>“I see,” she said. “An interest in Ehrenfest paper. I hadn’t realized you were on the research team that was working with our scholars this past term.”</p><p>“Well,” the boy admitted, “I was more of a helper than a researcher, but I did find it fascinating. Lady Charlotte’s idea to have multiple sheets of music being played at the same time to emulate several instruments at once was wonderful. I’ve been playing with it ever since we got back, but I don’t have much Ehrenfest music paper, so I’ve only been able to have four instruments represented. Still, I can only get out to reproduce the sound of the notes themselves, not the instruments. That’s my current focus.”</p><p>“Oh my,” Rozemyne said. “I’m sure she’ll be delighted to hear that you’ve expanded upon her idea.”</p><p>The boy’s cheeks tinged pink, though his expression didn’t change. Perhaps he was being put forward as a suitor for more than simply political reasons. “I do hope to work with her again, though my understanding is that she will not be taking the scholar course…”</p><p>Rozemyne nodded. “She will be focusing solely on the archduke candidate course as she is competing for the seat of aub.”</p><p>“Yes, I heard she…is favored for the role.” His eyes darted to where his brother sat. “That would preclude her from marrying outside the duchy, would it not?”</p><p>“Indeed it would.”</p><p>A small smile tugged at Alaric’s lips. “You know, we’ve been making charms for our people to use to pray to the gods for more divine protections. Since I just finished my first year, I’m hopeful this new practice will increase the number of my divine protections. I’m sure it will not rival yours in Ehrenfest, but it will be interesting to see how many one can get from praying on their own outside of religious rituals and participating in temple ceremonies.”</p><p>Rozemyne’s smile tightened. “Is there a reason you wish to avoid rituals and ceremonies?”</p><p>He seemed to be considering his words carefully. “A lack of opportunity on my part as well as scientific curiosity.”</p><p>“I see. All of us archduke candidates in Ehrenfest are ordained at our temple, so sometimes it’s difficult to imagine not having the opportunity to participate sometimes.”</p><p>Alaric nodded. “I do wish I could see what it’s like.” He lowered his head and said, “Maybe one day.”</p><p>At that point, it came Ferdinand’s turn to switch out with one of the guard knights to eat. While he could have participated in the meal proper as an archduke candidate, he wanted to be able to keep a better eye on their surroundings. He would join them when they ate with the aub.</p><p> </p><p>After Ferdinand prepared for bed, he passed Justus a sound blocker and listened to his report.</p><p>“Alaric is indeed being put forward as a candidate for Lady Charlotte. He was not on the list Aub Ehrenfest originally gave her, but he became interested in her during last term’s joint research project. He seems to be as skilled as one would expect from one adopted by Aub Drewanchel, and the only flaw anyone talked about was his interest in the temple, which started after his return from the Royal Academy.</p><p>“Many are speculating ways to get milady or Lord Wilfried to agree to more joint research during the three days we’ll be here. They likewise want to rope you in to some research as well, but they will settle with stealing ideas instead.</p><p>“They already noticed the magic tools are no longer working, which they’re very impressed by. They do not know you have discovered their magic circles yet.</p><p>“There is much speculation about our continued rise through the ranks considering our students’ performance and how our joint research has led to such sweeping changes across the land with even Klassenberg planning to corner Aub Ehrenfest into agreeing to joint research. Of highest concern, other than Lady Charlotte’s partner, is how Ahrensbach will react. It is no secret to Drewanchel how poor our relationship with our neighbor is.</p><p>“On that note, there was a little talk of Ahrensbach trying to have milady made Sovereign High Bishop, but it was dismissed as a ridiculous notion.</p><p>“Also, there were whispers that Ahrensbach might have found a way to increase the mana going to their lands without ‘sacrificing their archduke candidates to the temple.’ This is drawing some interest in Drewanchel.”</p><p>Ferdinand tapped his temple. Even in the previous weave, he and Letizia were made to perform religious ceremonies on their behalf. The only secret they had had was that an archnoble had dyed the foundation, not the useless harlot. Just what were they planning?</p><p>“They are currently researching methods of having hot water on demand with no mana requirements, similar to the basic concept behind the sewage system. It’s still in its early stages.</p><p>“They also are looking into light that doesn’t require mana or fire, but this has been an ongoing project, and they haven’t made much progress from what I can tell.</p><p>“They’ve successfully recreated the music box Ehrenfest has on display at the Interduchy Tournament.</p><p>“Everyone is foaming at the mouth to get their hands on the paper production method.</p><p>“Lord Ortwin is still favored to become the next Archduke. Most seem to agree Princess Adolphine would have been the ideal candidate were it not for the involvement of the royal family.</p><p>“They’re investigating the possibility of alternatives to sugar, and they seem to have had some success working with Jossbrenner. There’s apparently a tree there that produces a sweet sap. If it works, they hope to have milady create recipes with the new sweetener.</p><p>“Another project someone is working on is efficient methods of cleaning waterways.</p><p>“Aub Drewanchel’s third wife is going to be the mother for the next archduke candidate they’re adopting this summer.</p><p>“Their harvests were less plentiful this past autumn than before.</p><p>“The price of wheat is expected to rise with Dunkelfelger looking to import more.”</p><p>As Justus listed the more innocuous details, Ferdinand started contemplating the possible connection between Ahrensbach’s recent increase in mana supply, their claim it could be done without sending archduke candidates to the temple, and Drewanchel’s lacking harvest. Just how was Ahrensbach replenishing their lands, and were they going to use their new method to draw Drewanchel to their side?</p><p>He needed more information, but he couldn’t contact Raimund until winter, and he doubted his disciple would have too much information about the dealings of the archducal family. He would need to employ Justus during the upcoming Archduke Conference, which Ferdinand would attend as knight commander. Hopefully, he’d be able to learn something then.</p><p> </p><p>Throughout the entirety of the following day, Ortwin continued to try to pry information out of Wilfried, but unlike in the last weave, he’d been trained to recognize such tactics, so he was being very selective with his words. Ortwin was likewise guarding his knowledge.</p><p>He was still a boy, however, and he couldn’t resist the chance to challenge “The Ferdinand” to gewinnen. Naturally, Ferdinand thoroughly obliterated the boy at every level they played at, and Ortwin was so focused on the game that he let his guard down a bit, allowing Ferdinand to tease out more information than Wilfried had been able to obtain.</p><p>Ahrensbach was indeed in contact with Aub Drewanchel, though Ortwin was uncertain of the content of all of their discussions, though some were focused on finding a marriage partner for Detlinde. The aub had refused on the grounds that Drewanchel had already provided them a candidate for aub, so he saw no reason to sacrifice another to play relay consort to a woman so devoid of Mestionora’s blessings. Even appealing to the idea of having the consort train Letizia didn’t move him. He instead suggested they adopt a worthy successor preparing to enter their third year or petition to have someone attend the Academy in the off season like the priests and shrine maidens. His second suggestion was to take a candidate from a much lower ranking duchy as he would only be relay consort until Letizia came of age in the event Aub Ahrensbach perished before then.</p><p>Aub Drewanchel planned to approach Sylvester about Alaric and Charlotte, knowing that Wilfried’s recent engagement to Hannelore put him at an advantage for the seat of aub and that Sylvester still favored his daughter for the role. Ortwin’s choice of words suggested he was glad he wasn’t being considered to be consort. As Wilfried’s earlier descriptions of his friend included tidbits about how he was unhappily dragged to tea parties by his older sister, Ferdinand could imagine Ortwin wanted to avoid having another powerful, intelligent woman hold power over him.</p><p>In the end, it seemed Drewanchel was more interested in creating strong ties with Ehrenfest and cutting off Ahrensbach altogether. Still, if Aub Ahrensbach thought his method of filling the land would gain him allies, then it was still entirely possible the research duchy would form bonds with them.</p><p>That said, Ferdinand’s largest concern was still Georgine. He’d heard no word about any of her movements. She would surely retaliate in some manner for the loss of war funds.</p><p>Dinner that evening was a verbal spar as the aub and his wife tried to get information and promises of future joint research out of the candidates while they simultaneously attempted to tempt Ferdinand with rare materials and intriguing research. Of course, their main goal there was to try to steal ideas from him, and as a concession, he gave them a couple to maintain their amicable relationship.</p><p>They were extremely interested in Rozemyne’s hand pumps and tried to get more inventions out of her, but as with most requests made of her during these trips, she was able to defer to Aub Ehrenfest as he was the one who made business, marriage, and export decisions for their duchy.</p><p>She was able to ameliorate them to her, though, by explaining intellectual property rights in detail with an emphasis on rewarding researchers and scholars to incentivize them to keep innovating. This segued into the systems she was implementing with the spread of the publishing industry as well as a hint that the legal deposit law would be easier to follow if they had more efficient transportation circles. She offhandedly mentioned that Raimund was an expert at reducing mana costs, as proven by his research award, and that he’d already started looking at the idea.</p><p>In other words, Raimund was about to be strong armed into joint research with Drewanchel, though Rozemyne had subtly indicated she would not appreciate them trying to steal credit for his work. Though they held the higher rank, they had much to gain from keeping in her good graces, so Ferdinand imagined they would play by her rules.</p><p>After post-dinner negotiations, Ferdinand chided Rozemyne for committing his disciple to joint research he hadn’t agreed to and asked if she’d even considered what he would’ve wanted.</p><p>“Why?” she asked. “He’ll get all the mana and brewing prowess he needs to see my teleportation circle become reality, and I’ll get more books faster with the Legal Deposit System. I fail to see the downside.”</p><p>It was times like this that Ferdinand was reminded of just how selfish his fiancée could be.</p><p>The next morning, Rozemyne went to the lower city to meet with her Gutenbergs, and Ortwin arrived again to speak with Wilfried. As much as he played the diligent information gatherer, Ferdinand could also tell the boy was excited to see his friend in his home duchy, so he had no objections when the two wanted to go for a tour about the grounds. Wilfried had proven capable of handling himself, after all.</p><p>That didn’t mean he was going to send them unsupervised. He sent a visible Justus with them, partly to deter any misbehavior but also to give him agency to intervene if necessary. It was better to prevent mistakes than report on them after the fact.</p><p>During the candidates’ absence, Ferdinand was “invited” to a meeting of archducal scholars where they showed him some of the projects they were working on and sought his opinions on them. He recognized some from Justus’ report, though he hadn’t known about their experiments with cross breeding feyplants to try to combine or modify their unique properties. He was so drawn in that he hadn’t noticed how much time had passed until one of the attendants announced they needed to prepare for dinner.</p><p>When he returned to the guest chambers, Rozemyne’s knowing smile annoyed him until she said, “I’m glad you finally got the chance to work with them.”</p><p>That made him narrow his eyes. “Did you arrange for Lord Ortwin to take Wilfried out of the equation so they could all but force me into joining the research?”</p><p>“Oh no, that was Wilfried’s idea. Neither of us could bear the thought of you being in the research duchy without getting to do any research.”</p><p>It both warmed his heart and stoked his vexation at the two of them.</p><p>Dinner this time was focused on the research Ferdinand participated in with the scholars sharing his insights and the aub praising his ingenuity. They claimed his single day of contributions pushed forward their feyplant research by months - an exaggeration to earn his favor, of course.</p><p>“I would have never thought to pray to the goddesses of spring for their blessings to speed along their growth!” one said.</p><p>The aub smirked. “So not only can we speed up those experiments, we can also work on gaining divine protections in the process. Scholars, let’s look for other places where offering mana and prayers to the gods can similarly benefit our projects.”</p><p>“Yes, Aub!”</p><p>Rozemyne offered Ferdinand a smile that said, <em>Oh, so you told them about that, did you?</em></p><p><em>Yes,</em> he agreed, <em>but only that much. I’m not a fool who reveals too much when he’s deep into his “hobby.”</em></p><p>
<em>Oh, are you accusing me of leaking information when I read? Don’t you always accuse me of shutting everything else out when I’m engrossed in a book?</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand shot a look at Wilfried and turned his gaze back to her, suggesting she’d revealed quite a lot during their trip to Dunkelfelger, particularly where it concerned the orphanage.</p><p>Her polite smile tightened as it seemed to say, <em>Leaving those children in such a state would affect my reading time.</em></p><p>He barely kept himself from snorting. The girl had gone out of her way to see the orphanage by including it as her prize, and she wanted to pretend her actions were purely motivated by selfish reasons.</p><p>She obviously knew what he was thinking because her eyes narrowed further. He couldn’t discern her thoughts, however, as the aub drew his attention again to ask for his opinion on their other research.</p><p>By the time they returned to Ehrenfest, Ferdinand was in a surprisingly good mood and itching to get back to his estate to lock himself in his workshop.</p><p>Sadly, he needed to prepare for a meeting with Sylvester.</p>

<p>Two days after their return, Rozemyne and Ferdinand met with Sylvester in his office under a sound-blocking barrier.</p><p>“Alright,” he said, resting his elbows on the desk and folding his hands in front of him as he stared at the two of them. “I assume this is about more than hand pump negotiations.”</p><p>Rozemyne shot Ferdinand a quick look. <em>You want to, or shall I?</em></p><p>He tilted his head towards her, and she nodded. “Sylvester, the Foundation of the duchy is under the temple.”</p><p>Sylvester blinked at her for several moments. “I’m sorry. What?”</p><p>“The door from the aub’s office to the foundation actually teleports you to its real location under the temple. The key to the High Bishop’s bible opens the way from the temple side.”</p><p>Sylvester covered his mouth as he stared into nothingness, his mind reeling. Eventually, he croaked, “So you've had the key to the Foundation this entire time, and we’ve left the true path unprotected for generations. Good gods, if anyone knew… Does anyone know?”</p><p>Ferdinand grimaced. “It’s likely Georgine does. She was close to Benzewanst, after all, and she took all those letters with her.”</p><p>“Which would explain the ambush,” Sylvester said, pressing the heels of his hands into his eyes. After a moment, he dropped them again and looked to his younger brother, his gaze bleary. “Ferdinand, we need to shore up temple defenses, but we can’t be obvious about it. Rozemyne, I need to see this path for myself.”</p><p>“You’ll need to take a vow to be a priest,” she warned.</p><p>“That’s fine,” he said, waving a flippant hand. “I’m frankly embarrassed I haven’t done so already, given even Melchior has become a priest with the intention of becoming High Bishop.”</p><p>“About that,” Rozemyne said, “originally, the High Bishop was the heir, meaning they would always have a path to the foundation, even if the aub suddenly died. Do you want to change your plans given that?”</p><p>“No, but I do want one of the archducal family members in the position at all times. Good gods, under the tem— Wait, how do you even know all of this?”</p><p>Rozemyne glanced to Ferdinand, but before he could so much as nod, Sylvester gasped, “You didn’t…!”</p><p>“Didn’t what?” she asked, tilting her head and placing a hand on her cheek.</p><p>Sylvester closed his eyes and muttered, “You got the Grutrissheit, didn’t you? No, you don’t even need to confirm it. Ferdinand already said you were close. Of course a little gremlin like you went chasing after a damned book. Now there are two of you!”</p><p>“Two?” Ferdinand asked, glaring at Rozemyne. “When did you have time to take Wilfried?”</p><p>She shook her head. “I didn’t! He–”</p><p>“I don’t mean Wilfried, you insufferable fool!” Sylvester barked, slamming his fists against the desk as he glared at Ferdinand. “I mean you! And don’t give me that look! I’m not half as stupid as you seem to think I am! You think you can come in here, tell me two of my kids are half a breath from getting the Grutrissheit, and not expect me to connect the dots? My only questions are how long have you had it, and why didn’t you tell me about the foundation?!”</p><p>Ferdinand sat blinking in surprise.</p><p>Rozemyne stepped in to mediate. “Sylvester, it’s a very, very big book, and you’re not supposed to think about the information as it’s being shoved into your head. I just happened to notice it as it went by. Ferdinand probably hadn’t seen that part or gotten the chance to really investigate it.”</p><p>Sighing, Ferdinand tapped his temple and said, “To answer your other question, I got the first part of it when I was in my fourth year. I only obtained the rest recently.”</p><p>Sylvester dropped his forehead to the desk as he screamed muffled curses into its surface. Rozemyne’s eyes asked if he was going to be okay, and Ferdinand gave her a quick nod to assure her he’d recover. Eventually.</p><p>“We’re dead,” Sylvester moaned. “If they find out we have two archduke candidates with the Grutrissheit and another two just waiting for the opportunity to get it, they’ll kill us all and try to loot the book from your dead bodies. Didn’t you say one of the royals already came across one of the shrines? Why don’t they have the book yet?”</p><p>“That is beyond me,” Ferdinand sighed. “If they would simply look in the underground archive, they would find a map of the shrines. They are also more visible during the spring and summer. If they haven’t found them yet, that is the fault of their own incompetence.”</p><p>Sylvester began rubbing his forehead against the desk at that, muttering about his little brother being the one to doom them all. A moment later, he lifted his head and rested his forehead against his fingertips. “You know what?” he said, raising his free hand in surrender. “I’m going to stop thinking about it. Let’s tackle problems I can actually do something about. Temple. Foundation. Let’s go.”</p><p>They flew over to the temple where Hartmut and Clarissa greeted their lady with off-putting enthusiasm, but the look on Sylvester’s face quickly brought them to their senses.</p><p>“Hartmut,” Rozemyne said, “Sylvester will be taking vows. Please ready the altar in the High Bishop’s room. Fran, assist him.”</p><p>“At once, my lady.” Hartmut started directing people while Fran immediately headed for her chambers.</p><p>Everything was prepared, including tea, by the time they arrived, and Hartmut had two of his gray-robed attendants take Sylvester to a side room for nobles to change into blue priest robes as was necessary for the ceremony. When he returned, Hartmut gave him an overview of what would occur, and then Rozemyne conducted the ritual. Once that was complete, she went to her hidden room and returned with the bible key before leading the group down the hall to the library. Just short of the door, she spun around and ordered all save Aub Ehrenfest and Ferdinand to stay back. Then, she went inside, handed Sylvester the key, and showed him where to insert it on the statue of Mestionora. When the doorway opened, he gulped and then went inside.</p><p>As Fedinand and Rozemyne waited, she reached out and tugged at his sleeve. When he looked down at her, her expression spoke of her desire to talk to him privately, and he sighed while tapping his temple. What excuse could he use this time?</p><p>Sylvester came barreling back into the room, his face ghastly and covered in a sheen of sweat. “It’s really down there,” he whispered. “Gods, if Georgine knows, this is definitely the way she’ll come. You keep this key in your hidden room?”</p><p>Rozemyne nodded.</p><p>“Good. Keep doing that. Ferdinand, trap the hell out of this entrance, but give me a counter for what you use so that in the worst case scenario, my kids don’t die trying to take over the Foundation.”</p><p>“As you command.”</p><p>As Rozemyne took the key back, she said, “I’ll go put this away, then. If you’ll excuse me.”</p><p>After she left, Ferdinand turned to his pale brother and said, “I need to speak with her regarding some items related to…”</p><p>“Right, right,” Sylvester said, waving him off with a defeated sigh. “I’ll come down and give you permission so her guard knights won’t try to murder you this time.”</p><p>“That would be greatly appreciated.”</p><p>“Yeah, just don’t do anything to compromise her, alright?”</p><p>“What kind of man do you take me for?” Ferdinand growled. “She’s still in her summer.”</p><p>“Look, let me say it for my peace of mind, alright?” Sylvester said as he left for the High Bishop’s chamber. Once inside, he said Ferdinand and Rozemyne had his permission to enter her hidden room alone to discuss matters related to the duchy’s security.</p><p>When Cornelius went to protest, Sylvester’s glare cut him off. “As I said, this relates to the security of the duchy. I also do not appreciate the implication that you do not trust your knight commander nor my word as Aub Ehrenfest.” Cornelius backed down, his eyes on the ground as his jaw tightened.</p><p>On some level, Ferdinand appreciated that the annoying guard knight was trying to protect Rozemyne, but he wasn’t the one she needed protection from. Not yet, at least.</p><p>The moment the door was closed on the hidden room, Rozemyne had her arms around him, her cheek pressed against his chest.</p><p>“Rozemyne?” He didn’t think she was emotionally unstable. Had he missed something?</p><p>“It’s been so long since I’ve had a hug,” she explained.</p><p>“I hugged you when you returned from the Academy.”</p><p>“Right, a long time ago. We’ve been to three duchies and the Royal Academy since then. Please, let me have this.”</p><p>He sighed and patted her back. “Fine. Just for a little while.” Not that he would push her away, no matter how long she clung to him.</p><p>All too soon, she let go and went scampering off to her spring-loaded chair. She’d had another one made and brought to her room at some point, and he sat in it across from her. “You wanted to talk?” he prompted.</p><p>“Yes,” she said, “you said we would discuss your plans when I got back from the Academy. Well, I’m back.”</p><p>He stiffened and blinked at her several times as his throat closed around any words he tried to speak. While he had agreed to be more open and work with her rather than manipulate her, actually discussing his plots with her was…terrifying.</p><p>At no point did she move to speak. Instead, she simply sat and waited patiently, silently putting more and more pressure on him to talk as the moments dragged by.</p><p>Why was this so hard? He’d talked to her about the Book of Mestionora and the previous weave. This should have been nothing by comparison, and yet it was as though he physically could not trust her enough to share his plans for the future.</p><p>Well, that was it, wasn’t it? He didn’t trust her. More specifically, he didn’t trust her to still want to be with him after she saw what lay beneath the surface. Telling her what she wanted to know would expose a tiny portion of that, and he was afraid of what it would do to their relationship.</p><p>Then again, if he didn’t share it, he doubted they would have a relationship for much longer.</p><p>Perhaps he could start with an easier one. “First, I am planning to make Raimund my retainer.”</p><p>“That’s a given,” she sighed, looking disappointed.</p><p>He’d have to do better than that. Though it was painful, he decided to go with a plan he would need to discuss with her sooner rather than later anyway. “I would like us to bind our stars the spring after you graduate,” he said, his eyes sharp as he judged every minutiae of her reaction.</p><p>“So soon?” she asked, tilting her head, her moon-like eyes wide. “I thought you typically had to wait a year after coming of age to get married.”</p><p>She looked more curious than anything, which relieved him. “That’s to give people time to prepare. Recall that most will become engaged in their fifth or sixth year in the Academy whereas we’ve been betrothed since before you started.”</p><p>“I guess that’s true,” she muttered. “It still feels a little young to me since people didn’t get married in their teens in the dream world, but at the same time, I’m sure I’ll feel more like a grown up when I start having to tie my hair up, so… Okay, let’s do it then.”</p><p>Well, that was easy, and he didn’t even need to explain that he was perhaps overly eager to marry her and didn’t want to wait any longer than absolutely necessary, not when he knew just how easily she could melt away and become nothing more than a stone and an entry in the Book of Mestionora.</p><p>“So what else?” she asked, folding her hands in her lap.</p><p>This was it, then. From here, there was only one way forward, and there was no going back after he told her. His heart raced as his hands became ice and the color drained from his face.</p><p>“I… I’m making a magic tool,” he said in a hoarse whisper. “It’s a Grutrissheit.”</p><p>Rozemyne gasped. “You can do that?! Wait a second!” She pulled out her book and started swiping at its surface again before her eyes flashed from left to right a dozen times. She then sighed and dismissed it. “Wow, I can’t believe that queen. Just how selfish do you have to be? Well, we know how to get the Book of Mestionora, obviously. Why make a tool?”</p><p>“I plan to give it to a member of the royal family if Princess Eglantine is unable to obtain the book soon,” he said. “I have no interest in ruling, but I made an agreement with the tree to ensure a Zent was established, temporary or otherwise, to keep the garden from returning to white sand.”</p><p>Rozemyne started humming to herself as she lost herself in thought for a while. Then, she looked up at him and asked, “Why don’t I offer to lead her to the book when I’m done with my classes?”</p><p>“And expose yourself?” Ferdinand asked.</p><p>“I can just say I found the information in the underground library. The steps are basically there, right?”</p><p>“Do you think they’ll want a non-royal knowing the path to the Book of Mestionora? Even if you tell her and she gets it, they’ll either execute you or bring you into the family by force to keep the knowledge contained. You would have to move to the Sovereignty where it would be more difficult to protect your family and loved ones, especially with your lack of support base there.”</p><p>She furrowed her brows and tilted her head, pressing her finger into her cheek. “There’s gotta be a way to get her on the path without exposing myself to danger. Maybe I can just show her or Professor Adolphine the map of the shrines. She could probably take it from there.”</p><p>Tapping his finger against his temple, he ran through the worst outcomes of that scenario but eventually nodded. “That might work.”</p><p>“Then I’ll go with that,” she said. “Now, what’s next?”</p><p>He felt himself pale again. Would mentioning Georgine’s plans and his counters to them trigger her phobia?</p><p>Shaking his head, he reasoned she hadn’t regained those memories, so the damage from the trauma remained undone, meaning it couldn’t be triggered.</p><p>“In the previous weave, Georgine employed the poison Detlinde used on me when she attacked Ehrenfest. However, it’s only effective when breathed in.”</p><p>Rozemyne gasped again. “The masks from the ditter!” she said. “I was wondering about those. Do we have enough?”</p><p>“I ordered 300, and so far, 56 have been delivered.”</p><p>With a relieved sigh, she sank back into her chair. “Good. Should we embroider them with protective magic circles? Or maybe use invisible ink?”</p><p>Ferdinand rejected the ink idea. “It’s too much of a risk. What if you or I accidentally touched one in the heat of battle?”</p><p>Her eyes fell to the floor. “That’s…fair. I guess embroidery, then. Give me the masks you already have, and I’ll get my retainers to start working on them. I can do a few, too, during Mother’s training.”</p><p>“Fine, I’ll have them delivered to you at the castle.”</p><p>“You’re not going to bring them yourself?”</p><p>“I’m far too busy to play attendant.”</p><p>She pouted, and she refused to straighten her face even under his harshest glare. Had he employed them so much that she’d grown immune to them? He would need to change tactics going forward.</p><p>“In any case,” he growled, “We will need to distribute them in the border provinces. Any attacks would go through there, after all.”</p><p>Rozemyne nodded. “And we need to give them to key players here. I’m sure Georgine would just skip any fighting on the border and come straight for the Foundation. It’s what I would do. Do you have any other countermeasures in place?”</p><p>He told her he was having her craftspeople research the silver cloth and that Tuuli thought they’d found a way to add metal to the threads.</p><p>“Oh, like [#%*^%] fabric.”</p><p>“Like what?”</p><p>“It’s a type of fabric. Basically, from what I recall, you beat out metal until it’s as thin and narrow as you can get it, and then you wrap it around the thread you’re using before weaving it into cloth. Emperors used to use fabric made with gold and silver.”</p><p>Ferdinand cursed himself. If he’d included her sooner, then the investigation would have had a significant head start. “I don’t suppose you know what the metal is in the Lanzenave fabric?”</p><p>She shrugged. “It could be silver or platinum or something that only exists in their lands. Either way, I don’t think we have it here since everything was made with mana, and the metal doesn’t have any at all.”</p><p>There went his idea for replicating it. Still, he was mildly hopeful the commoners would know more about metals and be able to assist him in locating some that held no mana.</p><p>“The knights are also training with regular weapons and shields, so they’ll be able to defend against the Lanzenave soldiers if necessary.”</p><p>“So what about after Georgine?” Rozemyne asked.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>She huffed and gave him a glare that said, <em>You’re not fooling anyone, except maybe yourself.</em> “I mean that Ahrensbach is going to have some serious repercussions if Georgine attacks, and the royal family is likely not as forgiving as Sylvester when it comes to punishment by association. If anyone survives, it would be Letizia. <em>If.</em> I’m sure you’ve thought about it, so what’s your plan?”</p><p>Sighing heavily, he tapped his finger against his temple at a furious tempo. He truly did not want to tell her about those plans. On one hand, he was afraid she would reject them, and on the other, he was afraid she’d reject <em>him.</em> With a grimace, he forced himself to explain. “When you took the Foundation, you became Aub Ahrensbach. However, because the duchy was involved in treason, we transformed it into a new duchy that you named Alexandria.”</p><p>She smiled with a dreamy look in her eye. “Alexandria! The most fabulous library ever created with gardens, a zoo, and shrines to the muses! An entire library city with your workshop connected next door!” Suddenly, she came to her senses and shook her head. “Don’t tell me you’re planning on taking the duchy again!”</p><p>His heart stopped. “Yes, I am, with you as aub.”</p><p>Her eyes bugged. “Me?! Why?!”</p><p>“For many reasons,” he said, “one of which being that as consort, I couldn’t take any other wives, and while you could take more husbands, it’s common enough for women to refuse other suitors that you won’t be pressured into it. We alone have more than enough mana to manage a mere duchy.”</p><p>“‘Mere,’” she scoffed. Then she frowned as she contemplated what he said. “I really don’t want you to marry anyone else.”</p><p>“Nor I you,” he admitted, “though I would…accept it if you chose to do so.” He had to force the words out through his closing throat.</p><p>“No chance of that,” she said, filling him with a warm relief. “Besides, I don’t know how it’d even work with another partner considering I’m already…” Her cheeks turned a beautiful shade of red as she looked up through her lashes and then down at the floor again. “I’m already dyed.”</p><p>Heat flared in his ears as he turned away from her. That did bring up questions, but not any he wanted to experiment with. It shouldn’t have given him as much satisfaction as it did to know she was more or less permanently claimed by him.</p><p>He coughed to clear his intrusive thoughts and said, “I also believe you would be more well-liked as you have an uncanny ability to draw people to you.”</p><p>“Be that as it may,” she said, “do you really think the zent will just hand us a whole greater duchy?”</p><p>“No,” he said, “but if you were to take the Foundation while Georgine is attacking Ehrenfest…”</p><p>“Ah! It’s basically treasure stealing ditter!” she exclaimed. “But how can I get the Foundation without the key? Unless you’re suggesting we storm the temple and steal it from the High Bishop.”</p><p>“And why not?” Ferdinand asked. “Their High Bishop is no noble, and he won’t offer any resistance.”</p><p>“Won’t Aub Ahrensbach be down there guarding it?” she asked. “I… I don’t think I could kill him.”</p><p>“No need,” he shrugged. “Georgine will take care of that for you. She poisoned him in the last weave before she started making her final preparations. I imagine she’ll do the same this weave.”</p><p>“Geeze, what is it with the women in this family and poison?”</p><p>Ferdinand snorted. “It is a favorite among the nobility, not just in Sylvester’s family.”</p><p>Her head tilted at that, and he could see the question she didn’t speak - <em>Isn’t it your family, too?</em> Only Sylvester and his children were his family, though. He could not and would not claim anyone else.</p><p>“Couldn’t we just close the border gate to Lanzenave and save ourselves the headache?” she asked.</p><p>“And reveal someone had the Book of Mestionora?”</p><p>She sighed and crossed her arms. “That’s true.” Shaking her head, she asked, “Speaking of, what about Wilfried and Charlotte? She’s going to need the tablets after the divine protections ritual this winter regardless, but don’t you think Wilfried should at least get the last two?”</p><p>Ferdinand rubbed his forehead against the headache that was forming there. He had a feeling she would go ahead with it regardless of what he said. Better to control the rampage he couldn’t stop. “If you can do so without being seen, fine.</p><p>“Now, we’ve gone over the plans I have for the future. Is there anything else you wish to discuss?”</p><p>“Do you want to marry me so soon because of Alexandria?”</p><p>He sighed. “That’s part of it, yes.”</p><p>“So I would be an underaged aub?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“How will that work with me going to the Royal Academy?” she asked with a tilt of her head. “I won’t be home to do anything that requires, well, the aub.”</p><p>“Did you not just say earlier that your colors match my own?” he asked, avoiding using the word “dyed,” especially given how close to maturity she looked now. “The Foundation will not be able to tell us apart, so I will be able to step in and act as aub when you are not present.”</p><p>“Wow, this perma-dye thing sure is convenient,” she whistled. “Umm, will…will we even need…synchronization potions…?”</p><p>Her reddened face turned to the ground while Ferdinand looked away from her, his ears burning again as he tried very, very hard not to think about what those potions were for. He wanted to lecture her about bringing this up with her fiancé instead of her mother as was proper, but he understood why she couldn’t ask anyone else.</p><p>Even so, why ask at all? It would be years yet before they would even need to worry about it. Such a shameless girl!</p><p>“I…do not believe so,” he muttered.</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>Silence fell over the room.</p><p>“Then, uh, you might need to take my name.”</p><p>“What?!” he yelled, nearly leaping to his feet.</p><p>She covered her face and muffled an embarrassed groan. “Look, I’m a teenager, and the last major barrier to, you know, stuff is now no longer an issue.” Under her breath, she muttered, “I hate these stupid [%#&gt;€£*%].”</p><p>Running a hand down his face, Ferdinand sighed heavily and tried very, very, very hard not to follow where her words threatened to pull his thoughts. “We simply need to stop meeting alone,” he said.</p><p>“Wait, we can’t do that!” she protested. “How are we going to talk about the book or our plans or—“</p><p>“Rozemyne!” he barked. “Do you truly expect me to be able to use your name as Schutzaria’s shield when I need you to use mine for the same purpose?”</p><p>Her eyes widened as she shifted uncomfortably.</p><p>“Not now, of course,” he sighed, “but you will physically be of age in less than two years. Except for your hair and the length of your skirt, you will <em>look</em> like you’re of age. Do you understand?”</p><p>He didn’t think he would have struggled so much in the previous weave as Rozemyne had been oblivious to anything related to romance or winter, but if she were to struggle, too, then he couldn’t be certain his self control would stand against the encroaching frost. He’d forced down his inappropriate feelings in the previous weave when her actions caused them to rise up, but that was possible because she hadn’t done them with such a purpose in mind. If she were to deliberately do those things, however…</p><p>Images of what he’d done after forcing her out of his hidden room when she copied parts of her book into his flashed through his mind, making him feel a mixture of shame and Brennwarme’s blessing. The former far overpowered the latter, so at least he didn’t have to worry about the…physical proof of that blessing.</p><p>“I, um, I understand.”</p><p>“I’m done speaking about this,” he said. “Is there anything else?”</p><p>“Are we going to tell Sylvester about Georgine’s plans? I mean, beyond what we already told him.”</p><p>“He knows about the silver cloth and that it will allow someone to cross duchy borders without detection. I’ll tell him we suspect it’s from Lanzenave, so they’re likely working together. I don’t know how their plans will change, however, with Raublut’s death.”</p><p>“He was helping them somehow, right?”</p><p>Ferdinand explained the man’s involvement, and she expressed relief that he was no longer in the picture.</p><p>“But was he really the only inroad they had in the Sovereignty? Maybe Georgine has another ally.”</p><p>He shrugged. “It’s possible, but I won’t know anything until I investigate some more. I’m hopeful this year’s Archduke Conference will yield something useful.”</p><p>They fell silent for a time.</p><p>“Ferdinand?”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“Everything will be okay, right?”</p><p>In that moment, she looked so small, so vulnerable. Her wide, golden eyes betrayed the weakness she’d been hiding, the uncertainty of the safety of herself and those she cared about, the fear of the impending battle.</p><p>He reached out and stroked her hair, letting his fingers trail down the side of her delicate face. “Yes,” he said. “We’ll make it so.”</p><p>She suddenly grabbed his hand and pressed his palm against her cheek and leaned into his touch. He immediately wanted to pinch that soft cheek of hers, but the look on her face said she needed this bit of comfort, so he resisted the urge. He instead waited for her to have her fill.</p><p>Several moments later, she reluctantly let go, and he just as reluctantly lowered his hand. “That was my last question,” she said.</p><p>He nodded and then stood, holding out a hand to help her to her feet. When they left the hidden room, the only one giving him a reproachful look was Cornelius, but the annoying knight could say nothing after Sylvester’s announcement, so Ferdinand chose to ignore him.</p><p>Still, he did feel a little guilty after the thoughts he’d had, so he needed to distract himself. After bidding farewell to his fiancée, he went back to his estate where all the materials from Dunkelfelger awaited him.</p><p>It was a long, wonderful night of reserach.</p><p>The following morning, however, was a different story. Out of curiosity, he had opened his Book of Mestionora to see Rozemyne’s parts.</p><p>Only to discover most of it was missing.</p><p>He panicked. Was it because she hadn’t recovered those memories, so they didn’t technically exist and therefore couldn’t be included in the book? But they did exist. They were inside her feystone.</p><p>That thought gave him pause.</p><p>
<em>Surely not.</em>
</p><p>He opened his desk drawer and pulled out the box containing her feystone. Taking a deep breath, he held the stone in the palm of his hand.</p><p>Nothing changed.</p><p>With a frustrated frown, he pressed the stone to the book. The mana drained from it, filling the blank spaces with text.</p><p>He panicked for a new reason. Now that these memories existed in his book, did they exist in Rozemyne’s as well? Would she relive her trauma and be unable to look at feystones or ordonnanzes again?</p><p>He would have to find out soon. In the meantime, he decided to skim her portion of the book.</p><p>He found where Eglantine and Anastasius had forced her to circle the shrines, the former saying only Ehrenfest would suffer and the latter saying he was motivated purely by making his wife happy. Eglantine he could understand. Her logic was sound. Anastasius, however, seemed to be much better off without the woman he loved. The fool couldn’t seem to make a rational choice to avoid the towering stairway when she was involved.</p><p>He skipped ahead a few pages and stopped when he saw his name.</p><p>
<em>I asked Sylvester if I could write to Ferdinand, and he became exasperated. Even after everything, I was still thinking about Ferdinand.</em>
</p><p>He had wondered why her letters had stopped so abruptly, but it made sense given she was showing more care for him than her own fiancé.</p><p>More care for him.</p><p>Warmth bloomed in his chest and spread throughout his body. She could say it was purely familial love, but he didn’t care so long as he didn’t have to give up his position as her family to another man.</p><p>
<em>After seeing the love and consideration that Sylvester and Florencia had shown Wilfried, I’d really longed to have someone to lean on—someone I could actually be vulnerable with. In hindsight, I’d probably felt as alone as when I’d spent my first winter in the temple.</em>
</p><p>“Rozemyne…” he sighed, gripping the edges of his book tighter. Guilt pressed down on him as he remembered how upset she’d been when he told her she had to stay at the temple over the winter, how he’d deprived her of an entire season with her family but offered her no comfort in return. She’d only been seven, and she would lose her family so soon after.</p><p>The mistakes didn’t end there. He’d given her no one to support her in noble society. He’d only seen the short-term gain of keeping her in the temple where she was most comfortable. That had denied her the chance to build a deeper connection with anyone save himself, and he’d still tried to keep her at a distance. At least she had a better relationship with the Linkbergs and her adoptive family this time. He sincerely hoped she hadn’t felt alone after waking from her jureve.</p><p>Not wanting to read any more of what seemed to be a year of depression, he flipped to the earlier part of her story to read more about her time with her commoner family. He went a bit too far, however, and found entries describing her life in the dream world.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the majority of it was about books and libraries, though there were fascinating tidbits about different inventions and foods that didn’t exist in Yurgenschmidt. Electricity still intrigued him, but so did radio waves, computers, and the internet, though he supposed the latter was similar to having the Book of Mestionora with the vast amount of knowledge it contained.</p><p>Her descriptions of her family and acquaintances drew his attention as well. Her father had died when she was young, leaving her alone with her mother. While she had few memories of her father - and therefore few feelings - her raw, painful regret for prioritizing books over her family, for dying and leaving her mother alone tore at him just as much as when he’d looked into her memories, though he didn’t cry this time.</p><p>When he sought out her cause of death, he slammed the book shut with an exasperated sigh. <em>Of course</em> she was crushed to death by books. What else did he expect?</p>

</h3>

<div class="userstuff module" role="article">
<h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
<p>Sylvester had not allowed Ferdinand to attend the Archduke Conference, stating that he didn’t want to leave Ehrenfest defenseless given the threat they faced with Georgine and that Karstedt fulfilled the necessary role on his own. Ferdinand was able to convince him to take Justus for information gathering purposes, at least, so he would still get what he needed. This time, he wasn’t called over once, and that made him more nervous and frustrated than if he had to travel to the Royal Academy every day.</p><p>During the insufferable wait, he first confirmed that Rozemyne did not obtain the missing parts of the Book of Mestionora when they populated in his, so he sent a begrudging prayer of thanks to the petty goddess. Then, he spent his days tutoring Rozemyne, Wilfried, and Charlotte for the archduke candidate course, but when he got to the spell to destroy medals - which Charlotte was unable to learn - Rozemyne paled considerably.</p><p>“Every archduke candidate needs to know this,” he told her, though silently he added, <em>You especially since you’ll be Aub Alexandria.</em></p><p>She pulled her lips into a tight line but nodded and forced herself through the lesson. Her eyes said the entire time, <em>I hope I never, ever have to use this spell.</em> Unfortunately, she would for the traitors and those from Lanzenave who’d registered medals. He wouldn’t tell her that, though. There was no reason to have that hanging over her head for an indeterminate amount of time.</p><p>The rest of the time he spent brewing bullets and rejuvenation potions made with small blenrus fruits from his adolescent tree, conducting experiments, and trying to germinate the flammerzung fruit. By the end of the conference, they’d discovered they had to plant the entire fruit, not just the seeds, and it grew stronger if the skin was left intact. It also preferred warm water which would be annoying in the winter, but it was a small price to pay for such a valuable ingredient.</p><p>When Sylvester returned, he held his head high with a straight back and stern expression, projecting all the gravitas of an aub of an upper-ranked duchy. He had everyone meet in his office as usual, and he clapped his hands and said, “I have several announcements.</p><p>“First, we are now ranked sixth. Ahrensbach is officially below us at seventh.”</p><p>The room erupted in cheers while Rozemyne and Ferdinand exchanged a weighty look. It seemed neither could guess whether this would cause Georgine to speed up her plans or suffer severe setbacks that would keep her from invading.</p><p>“As you can imagine, Ahrensbach is less than thrilled with these results,” Sylvester said, “so students, be on guard when you return to the Academy.</p><p>“This rise in rank comes with costs, of course. We’ll need to send more nobles to the Sovereignty. As you know, we already have a low population, so I will take the children of the former Veronica faction with adequate mana from the temple and baptize them as their guardian.” That caused a stir that took several moments to quash. “I know they are the children of criminals, but we simply cannot continue to leave so many children with such potential in the temple when we are in desperate need of nobles, especially after losing so many to the purge and more to the Sovereignty here soon. There are several knights already there, so we’ll need to focus on scholars who want to go.</p><p>“As for the magic tools, Ferdinand, Rozemyne, if I provide the funding and materials, could you brew the tools the children will need?”</p><p>“Yes, Aub,” they said at the same time. Ferdinand had to actively hide his joy at the order, glad to have another chance to brew with his fiancée. This time, he wouldn’t have to send her away like in Dunkelfelger.</p><p>“Now,” Sylvester continued, “we have struck trade deals with the Sovereignty, Klassenberg, Dunkelfelger, and Drewanchel, so we will be hosting a number of their merchants this summer. Rozemyne, I’ll go over which products had the most interest later. We also struck deals on the blueprints for hand pumps, and these negotiations will set the stage for any other blueprints we sell in the future. Good job on the pre-negotiations, Rozemyne.”</p><p>“I thank you ever so much for the praise,” she said, her noble smile brightening.</p><p>“Our trends are spreading like wildfire throughout the country, so we can expect ever-increasing demand for the products showcased at the Academy. Rozemyne, I trust you to handle disseminating that information to our merchants.”</p><p>“Yes, Aub.”</p><p>“Now, marriage talks. First, there is no word on Detlinde’s suitor, though Aub Ahrensbach showed little if any concern about it. Drewanchel is putting increasing pressure on us to accept one of their archduke candidates as a fiancé for Charlotte while the heir to Dunkelfelger is still seeking to make her his first wife. We also had several aubs express that they had nobles who wanted to marry into our duchy. As such, if any are approached at the Royal Academy with proposals, they should send word immediately so that we can determine if it’s an acceptable match. We cannot afford to turn away opportunities to increase our population, but I will not risk our security to do so.</p><p>“The royal family held a Dedication Ritual with all aubs and their spouses taking part at the end of the conference with the promise that participants would be allowed to redo the divine protections ritual. The losing duchies will go first.</p><p>“And finally, Klassenberg has pushed to conduct joint research with us on Dedication Rituals. While this can hardly be called research since adults are so involved, it’s also paramount to explore any and all avenues for increasing everyone’s mana or mana efficiency. As such, this research will be conducted this coming year, but Klassenberg will shoulder all of the cost, the Sovereignty will provide the materials and instruments necessary, and our archduke candidates will lead the rituals. Frenbeltag also wants to conduct research regarding archduke candidates giving mana to their duchies through religious ceremonies, but whether or not that happens as well as the details will be decided by the students. The adults will not be involved whatsoever.</p><p>“That is it for the announcements. Everyone save the archducal family, leave.”</p><p>After the room cleared, Sylvester sighed and leaned back in his chair, his shoulders along with his countenance relaxing. “Man, what a conference. I thought Georgine was going to murder me with her eyes alone when they announced our new ranking.”</p><p>Ferdinand and Rozemyne exchanged another look. That anger might speed up her timeline. They needed to start preparing immediately.</p><p>“Now, Charlotte, I gave you a list of suitors to consider last year, and this year, Drewanchel was pushing a boy named Alaric to be your betrothed. Have you made any decisions yet?”</p><p>She placed a hand on her cheek and looked down. “I’m…I’m afraid not, but I would like to speak with Mother about this.”</p><p>Florencia gave her a soft smile. “Of course. We can meet for a long discussion three days from now.”</p><p>“I hate to pressure you,” Sylvester said, “but our new rank is only going to attract more people pushing for your engagement. I won’t be able to turn Drewanchel down next year, so you need to make up your mind soon.”</p><p>“Yes, Father.”</p><p>They went over a few minor things before Sylvester dismissed the children. Then, he looked at Ferdinand and said, “Something feels off about this Ahrensbach business.”</p><p>He nodded. “I agree. There are several concerning things. First, even though Detlinde is of age and will inherit the position of aub should her father die before Letizia comes of age, she has no suitor, yet they are unperturbed. My intelligence suggested that Aub Ahrensbach was requesting a match from Drewanchel at the beginning of spring.”</p><p>“What’s their plan, then?” Sylvester asked. “They can’t afford to leave her unattached when their true heir isn’t even starting at the Academy until the winter after next. Do you think they’re going to adopt an archnoble and have them attend off-season to complete the archduke candidate courses?”</p><p>“That…is a possibility,” Ferdinand said, tapping his temple. He certainly didn’t know every archnoble in Ahrensbach, but he at least knew of them, and he couldn’t determine which child the aub would decide to marry to his worthless daughter. Perhaps the knight commander’s son? He was entering into his fourth year, though, so it would be another three at minimum before they could wed. Maybe one of Ferdinand’s previous attendants’ children? He recalled one of them had a son that should have been entering his fifth year, and he wouldn’t have a partner until the upcoming winter.</p><p>Sylvester sighed and scratched the back of his head. “What’s all this do for Georgine’s plans?” When Ferdinand looked at Florencia, his older brother waved a flippant hand. “She knows. She’s my wife and will be defending the duchy with me.”</p><p>Florencia nodded with a solemn face.</p><p>It was then that Ferdinand recalled she had been with child at this time in the past weave. Had Sylvester’s new-found attitude made him take precautions against impregnating his wife this time? Had changing the timing of the purge affected that part of their relationship?</p><p>Either way, it seemed they were still close, so he doubted they were at odds with each other. This would’ve been a terrible time for a baby regardless.</p><p>With a sigh, Ferdinand said, “I don’t know when exactly she plans to attack now. There are too many unknowns. For one, how has their mana supply suddenly increased? For another, what are their plans with Detlinde? What’s their current relationship with Lanzenave? How much silver cloth have they obtained? What has stayed her hand thus far?</p><p>“Regardless of the answers, we need to begin preparing for an invasion. I have nearly a third of the masks I ordered to block against airborne poison, and Rozemyne and her retainers are embroidering them with protective magic circles. The Knight’s Order is already training with traditional weapons that will cut through the silver cloth. We need to turn our attention to other defenses, like preparing the border provinces, brewing weapons, and setting traps.”</p><p>Sylvester nodded. “Yeah, I’ll leave that part of it to you as knight commander. I’ll look into strengthening the defenses connected to the Foundational magic. Florencia, you look into funding and spreading word in a way that won’t cause panic or tip off our enemies. We’re going to have a busy summer.”</p><p> </p><p>Later that night, Ferdinand received Justus’ report. Unsurprisingly, Ahrensbach held quite a bit of resentment towards Ehrenfest, which led him to believe they wouldn’t be attacking with just Lanzenave troops this time. Their princess was rejected once again, but it didn’t seem to cause any real stir among the servants. No one knew or talked about how Ahrensbach was gaining more mana, but it apparently wasn’t extending to Werkestock yet.</p><p>That gave him pause. Werkestock made up a large portion of Georgine’s support base. What had driven her to abandon it?</p><p>Justus had a lot to say about Anastasius. Apparently, he’d championed the idea of performing a Dedication Ritual at the Archduke Conference, and he’d gotten the idea from Rozemyne. He also ran interference in the background with Klassenberg, ensuring they would shoulder the cost of the “joint research” so as not to place undue burden on Ehrenfest. Ferdinand began to worry what consequences this blatant favoritism would have for the duchy.</p><p>The only other news pertaining to the royal family was Eglantine’s discontent that Adolphine had not located the information she was after in the underground archive. He could only assume that meant she’d yet to find all the shrines, or she wasn’t sure what to do about the magic circle in the sky. Had she not been to the library or underground archive herself?</p><p>What a foolish question. If the royal family had been visiting the library, the country wouldn’t be dealing with half the issues they were facing.</p><p>“With all this unrest,” Ferdinand said, “I’m increasingly uneasy about sending Rozemyne to the Royal Academy without archknights. Though she’s taken Nikolaus as a guard knight against her brother’s advice, he’s only a first year.”</p><p>He’d been against her taking him into her service as well since the boy was talented, large for his age, and raised by a woman who did Veronica’s dirty work, she was much stronger this weave and could take down Lestilaut, so he eventually conceded that a first-year apprentice knight would offer little danger to her, especially with her plethora of charms. The boy was extremely respectful towards her and seemed to view her as a true older sister, though the sentiment did not extend to his brothers.</p><p>“My lord?”</p><p>Janrik’s voice cut through Ferdinand’s thoughts. “What is it?” he asked.</p><p>The attendant looked down and said, “Um, Lady Rozemyne may not be as lacking in archknights this winter as previously thought.”</p><p>Ferdinand narrowed his eyes. “Explain.”</p><p>“Anneliese…is carrying Geduldh’s burden.”</p><p>His thoughts froze. After several moments, he finally found the words to ask, “Your starbind is taking place this summer, is it not?”</p><p>“…Yes, my lord.”</p><p>“Then how…?”</p><p>Janrik looked away, his face flushed. Justus clapped a hand over his mouth to stifle his laughter, for all the good it did. Eventually, he got control of himself enough to say, “My lord, this happens more often than you would think, especially since children aren’t known to the general public until their baptism.”</p><p>Ferdinand sighed and pressed a finger against his forehead. Naturally, a couple of mednobles wouldn’t have a retinue of retainers watching their every move from dawn until dusk, so they likely had more than enough opportunity. “When will Entrinduge visit?”</p><p>“Mid to late autumn, we suspect.”</p><p>He sighed again. “Barely a full season… Will it not be evident what occurred when you’re elevated to archnoble status so soon after your starbind?”</p><p>Janrik rubbed his arm uncomfortably and muttered, “Well…”</p><p>“My lord,” Eckhart said, stepping forward, “this will mean Matthias will be an archnoble this winter. I believe any amount of embarrassment is worth the increased protection Rozemyne will gain.”</p><p>While that was true to some degree, there would be whispers that he had no control over his retainers, and it might lead them to speculate about him and Rozemyne. Their unsupervised trips into their hidden rooms wouldn’t help matters.</p><p>Perhaps he should consider installing transportation circles in their hidden rooms after all.</p>

<p>It all started with the look in his eyes when he knelt before me, gazing up at me as my blessing rained down over him and his duchy’s apprentice knights. I had had suitors make overtures before. I’d had sisters make overtures for their little brothers.</p><p>But I’d never been looked at like that, like Sterrat adorned my hair with stars and the Goddess of Light made the moon shine from my eyes.</p><p>After our ditter match where my older sister so thoroughly embarrassed him, Lord Lestilaut approached me with the strangest request. He wanted me to use my schtappe to bind him. At first, I thought he was one of <em>those</em> that Mother and Lady Elvira had warned me about, but he’d merely wanted to test my strength against his since my mana sensing hadn’t developed yet. He was able to break free.</p><p>Barely.</p><p>It gave me no end of satisfaction that Aub Ehrenfest would boast more mana than Aub Dunkelfelger once I inherited my father’s seat. Lord Lestilaut, however, seemed satisfied for a different reason. He started with challenging me to a rematch, being sure to state they couldn’t take Hannelore back, but he could still win me.</p><p>It was…flattering, I suppose, for a man such as him to wish to pursue me, but I was less than thrilled with being treated as a trophy. Hannelore took the position because she wanted to. I had no desire to marry outside of Ehrenfest, however.</p><p>After I rebuffed him the second time, he changed tactics, as was the Dunkelfelger way. He started sending me letters, asking for more information about me - what I liked, what I didn’t like, what my hopes for the future were… I responded, of course, as was necessary to maintain a positive relationship with the future aub, and I asked for the same in return to be polite.</p><p>I knew he was an artist from the illustrations he did for Rodrick’s book. What I didn’t know was how truly passionate he was about it. He loved art so much that when he reacquired his protections, Kuntzeal was among the ones he’d gained, along with another he was too embarrassed to claim, though I suspected it was Bluanfah.</p><p>He was so brazen on the outside yet so shy about the silliest things. It was the complete opposite of his little sister.</p><p>I quickly found myself looking forward to his letters. They always included a little doodle or two that I could imagine him absentmindedly drawing as he thought of what else to write. The thought alone always brought a smile to my face.</p><p>He then asked if he could escort me to my tea parties, which I didn’t really know how to refuse. As we walked, we would chat about this and that, sometimes about our siblings, sometimes about our homes, mostly about nothing at all. He almost never smiled during these trips, but I could tell he was enjoying himself. Why else would he go out of his way to escort me, especially when he had a fiancée elsewhere in the Academy?</p><p>These walks were murder on my heart, however. Whenever I emerged from the dormitory, his eyes would light up like they did the night I gave him Angriff’s blessing. When we parted, they would turn melancholy, growing worse with each passing day. How was I supposed to feel in the face of that? I had to harden my heart against him, knowing there was nothing I could do but offer to be his ally once I became Aub Ehrenfest. He wouldn’t give up his seat for me; how could he ask me to give up my seat for him?</p><p>At the graduation ceremony, he’d looked at me with such longing that I had to turn away, only to come face to face with Lord Ortwin. He’d blushed and eventually smiled back, but he was merely embarrassed. The juxtaposition between his reaction and Lord Lestilaut’s only served to make my chest feel like it was caving in on itself.</p><p>It was at that moment I realized no matter what I did, I would be unhappy to some degree.</p><p>Liebeskhilfe was a cruel goddess.</p><p>I had considered the boys on my father’s list. I had even considered boys not included in the list, like Lord Alaric from Drewanchel. At some point, I realized I’d started comparing them to Lord Lestilaut. Of course, the boys were still young and had the potential to grow into someone even greater than him, so I knew I merely needed to wait.</p><p>That was what I thought, anyway, until the next day when he’d ascended the stage dressed as the God of Darkness. As he whirled, his movements powerful, his lines graceful, I could only think of one word:</p><p>
<em>Perfection.</em>
</p><p>I couldn’t help but picture him as my God of Darkness, covering me in his cape. How could a man be so strong, so brazen, so delicate, and so beautiful all at the same time?</p><p>For the first time in my life, I caught myself thinking, <em>I wish I weren’t going to be Aub Ehrenfest.</em></p><p>It was a fleeting notion, an intrusive thought that didn’t align with my true desires.</p><p>Yet it shook me to my core.</p><p>That night, he’d sent me a small package. In it was a letter, expressing his regret that he was graduating and thus unable to see me next year, that he enjoyed the time he spent with me, and that he wanted to keep in contact, along with several magic letters that he intended for me to use to respond to him while we were apart. Beneath those was a painting that stole the breath from my lungs.</p><p>It was meant to be his view of me as he knelt and watched the blessing rain down. I was far more gorgeous than in person, the light of the blessing casting me in an ethereal, beautiful glow.</p><p>On the back, he’d written, <em>To my Goddess of Light, my Goddess of War, my Valkyrie</em>.</p><p>I’d just recently read the tale of valkyries from the book Hannelore had lent my sister. They were messengers of Angriff, revered by those in Dunkelfelger as mighty warriors that their women took inspiration from.</p><p>Tears actually streamed down my face as I cursed Liebeskhilfe’s capriciousness.</p><p>The first of his letters came not even a week after my return to Ehrenfest. He spoke of his home, how the land was in abundance, how his dogs were glad to see him home, and how lonely it was knowing he’d only see me at the Interduchy Tournament and maybe in the future at the Archduke Conference.</p><p>I told him about Ehrenfest in turn, how snow still covered the ground, how the nobles wouldn’t go home until after the feast celebrating spring, and how I would miss having someone to escort me at the Royal Academy next year.</p><p>The next letter talked about the temple reforms Dunkelfelger was implementing, and I both complimented him on the initiative and gave advice based on our own temple. The one after that lamented that while my sister and brother were able to go to Dunkelfelger, I had remained home. He regretted not being able to show me his homeland, and I could practically read the words he’d left unwritten - <em>”Maybe I could have convinced you to make it your homeland as well.”</em></p><p>He wrote again after my siblings left, and this time, he included another painting, this one of me holding Leidenschaft’s spear at the viewer as it crackled with mana. It was how I’d looked to him moments before I destroyed his black shield. Again, I was gorgeous in his eyes, a goddess alighting on the field of battle. Of course, I could never measure up to his image, but it moved me to know someone could see me this way. I had always been told I was adorable, but I’d never been <em>beautiful</em> in the way the Goddess of Light was to her God of Darkness.</p><p>Our correspondence continued until the Archduke Conference. He was likely busy with filling in for his father’s absence, just as I was nearly overwhelmed with supplying the Foundation and learning archduke candidate course material under Uncle.</p><p>When Father returned, he announced that my hand was still eagerly sought and that Drewanchel was putting forth Alaric. I had gotten to know him a bit during the joint research project, and while his enthusiasm was endearing, he didn’t leave a very strong impression.</p><p>Father, however, had given me a deadline that I feared wouldn’t leave me time to get to know him any further. Even if I did have the time, what he said about Lord Lestilaut consumed my thoughts to the point I could barely remember the other boy’s name.</p><p>He was still asking for me. Even now.</p><p>Those words banished Gebordnung and summoned Verdrenna’s storms within me. As moved as I was that he still wanted me, that he was thinking of me even now, I resented that he knew I was vying for the seat of aub, yet he still wanted me to give up my ambitions for him. It was with no small effort that I held my peace until I at last met with my mother over tea.</p><p>After the preliminary niceties were out of the way, I asked permission to erect a sound-blocking barrier. Then, I said, “Mother, I will not dance with Grammaratur. I feel I’m standing before an impossible choice and that no matter which answer I come to, I will always doubt it.”</p><p>Mother set down her teacup and gave me her full attention. “Who are you choosing between, Charlotte?”</p><p>“Lord Lestilaut and the archduke candidate from Drewanchel,” I admitted with a guilty sigh.</p><p>“My, I feel the fact you didn’t even state the other boy’s name should tell you everything you need to know,” Mother said with a sweet smile.</p><p>I shook my head and looked down at my broken reflection in the ripples of my tea. “It’s not that simple. While I am certainly…moved by Lord Lestilaut, I cannot marry him and be Aub Ehrenfest. I’ve been the favorite to inherit since shortly after my baptism. It’s what I’ve been studying and working tirelessly to accomplish. It’s what everyone has been training me for. I don’t want to abandon that for…for Liebeskhilfe’s games.”</p><p>“I see,” she said, casting her eyes down in sympathy as she took a sip of her tea. After several moments, she said, “If you become aub, you will have to rely heavily on your husband, especially when you carry Geduldh’s burden. Is the Drewanchel archduke candidate someone you can rely on during those months when you are unable to give adequate mana to the Foundation?”</p><p>“I’m not certain,” I said, still looking into my teacup. “I didn’t speak with him often, and I didn’t feel the need to deepen my bond with him since Wilfried already built a strong connection with Drewanchel through Ortwin, who’s favored to be the next Aub Drewanchel. I can put more of an effort in becoming closer to him this winter, but my decision has to be made before the next Archduke Conference, or it will be made for me. I fear putting it off for nearly a year will not make things any easier. In fact, it may lock me into a single choice, which is no choice at all.”</p><p>Mother put her hand on her cheek and sighed. “It is rather unfair that you have to decide on your partner so early, but that seems to be the norm for my children. Rozemyne was engaged before she started attending the Royal Academy, and Wilfried just completed his third year and already has two finacées. I wouldn’t be surprised if Sylvester announced Melchior’s engagement tomorrow at the rate things are going.”</p><p>That dragged a giggle from me, but it quickly died as the weight of my future pressed down on me once again. “If I marry Lord Lestilaut, I’m afraid I will grow bitter for having to give up what I’ve spent my entire life pursuing. I will be denying myself for the sake of a man. If I marry Lord Alaric, I will always compare him to Lord Lestilaut and wonder if I could have been happier with him instead. I fear I will never open my heart to Lord Alaric, nor will I make him happy. Our marriage would be something for us to endure, not take solace in. However, I will have what I’ve been working for my whole life.”</p><p>Placing a hand on her chest, Mother looked skyward and sighed. It looked as though she were offering a prayer to the gods for guidance and grace. “Charlotte, it seems you must decide between love and ambition. It’s a question many women face, and if you ask them if they regretted the decision they made, you would get answers of every kind. No one can truly say what will make them happy in the future as circumstances change as do we.</p><p>“Which is more important to you, Charlotte? Love or ambition?”</p><p>“I…” Clenching my teacup in white-knuckled hands, I closed my eyes and searched within myself.</p><p>By the end of the tea party, I was no closer to an answer.</p>

<p>At the beginning of summer, Charlotte requested permission to travel to Dunkelfelger via their dormitory at the Royal Academy to accompany Rozemyne’s gray robes. While Ferdinand and Sylvester were initially against it, Florencia let them know in no uncertain terms that it <em>would</em> be happening; their agreement was a mere formality. Wilfried and Brunhilde also asked permission to go, which Aub Dunkelfelger immediately approved.</p><p>The day of their departure, Rozemyne held onto Ferdinand’s sleeve and pasted on her noble smile as she bid goodbye to four of her gray robes, her big brother, her little sister, both their entourages, her attendant, and the six guard knights that would be protecting her grays. Charlotte, Wilfried, and Brunhilde were due to return after two weeks. The knights would swap every fortnight until the Dunkelfelger branch of the Rozemyne Workshop was established. Since they were bringing along all the necessary supplies with detailed blueprints, local carpenters and blacksmiths would finish putting together the equipment, which they estimated would take a little over a week. From there, Rozemyne estimated the workshop would be ready to go no later than mid-autumn, but she suspected they would finish before that.</p><p>“The children in their orphanage might have been malnourished,” she said, “but they had Dunkelfelger spirits. I could tell just from the looks in their eyes, but it was also evident from the way they moved to protect each other. Despite their circumstances, they hadn’t given up. I think they’ll seize any chance they can get at improving their lives.”</p><p>Two weeks later, the archduke candidates returned, and Rozemyne gripped Ferdinand’s sleeve in her anxiety once again. “Something’s wrong with Charlotte,” she said to him after passing him a sound-blocking tool.</p><p>The girl had the same placid smile as always, but there was a tightness around her eyes as she sought out her mother. She made her greetings with as much haste as politeness would allow before leaving with Florencia. Sylvester looked worried, but he turned his attention to his exhausted son.</p><p>“They, uh, put you through the wringer over there?”</p><p>Wilfried nodded. “Yeah. They tried to get me to ditter, but I told them we didn’t have time to do any brewing while we were helping to oversee the establishment of Rozemyne’s workshop, so they made me ditter without magic tools. I didn’t even know they had that kind.”</p><p>Ferdinand scoffed and said, “They don’t. Regardless, I trust you were not an embarrassment to the Ehrenfest Knight’s Order as future knight commander?”</p><p>Wilfried scoffed back. “Of course not. I still won. They might be able to manifest Leidenschaft’s spear, but they still can’t call four of them at once. Not to mention, Hannelore informed us of all their battle plans. I don’t know how she turned one of Lord Lestilaut’s retainers, but she’s definitely got him tied around her finger.”</p><p>“Who did they pit you against?”</p><p>Brunhilde laughed. “It would be more accurate to ask, ‘Who <em>didn’t</em> he face?’ First, it was Lord Lestilaut. Then, it was Rarstark. Then, it was Lord Heisshitze. Then, it was Aub Dunkelfelger. He did lose the last one, though. Even Hannelore’s mole, Lord Kentrips, could not obtain the aub’s plans, and he was able to summon three spears.”</p><p>“Did you just throw Leidenschaft’s spears at each other?” Rozemyne asked, disappointed.</p><p>“No,” Wiflried said, waving her off. “You’re not the only one who can strategize, you know. I haven’t been getting humiliated by Uncle at gewinnen for nothing. But facing down four copies of a divine instrument crackling with mana is an excellent intimidation tactic, and Lord Lestilaut didn’t even see me coming when I summoned a sword and smacked him off his highbeast before killing his treasure. Oh, by the way…” Wilfried waved to Leopold who stepped forward with a small box that he presented to Justus. “Spoils of war. Figured I’d share since I don’t do much brewing.”</p><p>Ferdinand’s estimation of Wilfried suddenly increased.</p><p>“Wait wait wait!” Sylvester yelled, holding up a hand. “Back it up. Are you telling me you summoned four Leidenschaft’s spears <em>and</em> still pulled out a sword? What is that?! That’s basically five schtappes, right? I thought only Ferdinand could pull crazy stunts like that.”</p><p>Rozemyne laughed. “You think Ferdinand is limited to only <em>five</em>?”</p><p>He glared at her, but she just smirked back. Her cheeks would pay the price for her insolence once there weren’t so many witnesses.</p><p>“It’s not that big of a deal,” Wilfried shrugged. “Rozemyne and Charlotte can do it, too, though Rozemyne can do more, and Charlotte can only do three.”</p><p>Sylvester turned an accusing glare on Ferdinand. “What the hell, Ferdinand?! You’re turning my kids into monsters!”</p><p>“I am training them to be aub and knight commander.” The fact that he was teaching two of them to be aub was beside the point.</p><p>“Yeah, Father, this is really the bare minimum for me and Charlotte if we want to lead an upper-ranked duchy.”</p><p>Sylvester got a far away look in his eye for a moment as he mouthed the words, “Bare minimum.” After a moment, he shook his head and said, “Alright, let’s go out to the training grounds. I want to see these spears in action!”</p><p>Despite his exhaustion, Wilfried perked up at the chance to show off for his father. “Yeah! Let me escort Brunhilde to the landing area first, though. She’s returning home for the rest of her time off.” He turned and held out a hand to her, which she took with a smile after bowing to her lady. As they left, Ferdinand wondered if Wilfried had ever looked that happy in the previous weave.</p><p>With a heavy sigh, Sylvester ran a hand through his hair and muttered, “Guess things didn’t go well with that trouble maker,” before leaving the room.</p><p>Rozemyne looked up at Ferdinand, but he shook his head. Charlotte would come to her in her own time.</p><p> </p><p>By the summer Starbind Ceremony, twelve mednoble and three archnoble scholars had come forward to express their intent to move to the Sovereignty. It would be a blow to Ehrenfest, but one they would have to weather. It was made more bearable, however, by the Sovereignty nobles returning during the summer. Many of the knights who had left to escape the political climate created by Veronica had been impressed with both Aub Ehrenfest and the performance of the apprentice knights in speed ditter. They returned with hopeful grins only to have them replaced with ghastly grimaces. They had jauntily joined the knights for training with the assumption that Ferdinand was an easier task master than the Sovereign Knight Commander only to discover how gravely mistaken they were. Of course, this wasn’t enough to put them off. In fact, it seemed to improve their opinion of their home duchy.</p><p>Hirschur came about two weeks after the starbind with several boxes of documents and an armful of boards in her hands. Ferdinand and Rozemyne greeted her upon her arrival and took her to his estate where she started spreading out the boards to show him her latest research. Meanwhile, Rozemyne disappeared into the library.</p><p>Hirschur’s current project was fascinating. She had been researching a magic tool that would mimic the sun’s rays at a given time of year and encourage rapid growth of plants. In theory, they could construct a botany room and grow autumn plants any time of year, and they would grow twice as fast. The tricky part, as always, was incorporating the life element. They went back and forth on it for a while, pulling out more and more notes on magic circles as they talked.</p><p>At some point, Justus interrupted them long enough to give them some sandwiches to eat. It seemed not even a moment later when he did so again, but thanks to the nature of the meal, they were able to keep working even as they ate. He hadn't even noticed when he’d finished eating. That was how unobtrusive it was.</p><p>“Ferdinand?”</p><p>He looked up from his work at Rozemyne. “Yes?”</p><p>“The God of Darkness will be covering the sky with his cloak soon. I must depart now, but I shall return after the Goddess of Light shines in the sky. I pray you and Professor Hirschur sleep with Schlatraum’s blessing.”</p><p>“Has it gotten that late already?” he asked, looking towards the twilight-filled windows.</p><p>“I’m afraid so. If you’ll excuse me, then.” She and Hirschur exchanged a couple of polite words before she left.</p><p>“Your fiancée is quite the treat,” Hirschur said, smiling like a satisfied zantze. “She creates food that you can eat while researching and doesn’t interrupt unnecessarily.”</p><p>Ferdinand scoffed. “Only because she’s busy reading.”</p><p>“Perfect for keeping out of the way, then.” She picked up a board and then snapped her fingers. “Ah, right. Ahrensbach sent someone to take courses during the off season. He’s grown, but he’s having to start from the beginning like many of the other blue priests. I find it hard to believe he’s from the temple, however, given his mana quantity and the fact he’s going through the archduke candidate course.”</p><p>Ferdinand narrowed his eyes. “What’s his name?”</p><p>“Lucius.”</p><p>He didn’t know a Lucius. “And just who is that?”</p><p>Hirschur set aside her board and picked up another. “Someone from one of their archnoble families, though I suspect he’s of Werkestock blood originally. He was likely hidden away so he wouldn’t be taken by the Sovereign Temple or killed since his parents were undoubtedly high enough up to be purged.”</p><p>Ferdinand tapped his temple as he dug through his memories of Ahrensbach. He hadn’t gone to the temple much, nor had he known all of the blue priests there. Was it possible he was a devouring child like Rozemyne who was abandoned and grew up using the divine instruments as magic tools until he was discovered by someone in the nobility?</p><p>Was Lucius the reason Aub Ahrensbach had been so lackadaisical about Detlinde’s marriage prospects at the Archduke Conference? They must have found him between then and the earlier call to Drewanchel. If so, it seemed they were following Aub Drewanchel’s advice by adopting someone to be an archduke candidate to marry the harlot.</p><p>“What else can you tell me about him?”</p><p>Picking up another board to compare with the one in her hand, she replied, “Polite, handsome, brown hair, brownish eyes. He’s popular with most of the professors. I haven’t seen him interact with the royals much, but I’ve heard Prince Anastasius is on guard against him since Princess Eglantine was cordial to him. I think you and I both know that’s not the reason.”</p><p>The prince was still on guard against Ahrensbach, to Ehrenfest’s benefit, hopefully. The royal opinion of the man didn’t matter to Ferdinand nearly as much as his inability to remember an archnoble matching his description. He couldn’t swallow the story about him being a blue priest with mana to match an archduke candidate, even if that candidate was Detlinde.</p><p>“Please keep me informed of any developments,” Ferdinand said, “and in exchange, I’ll send you some of my research documents.”</p><p>She quirked a brow at him. “Very well.”</p><p>All he learned about Lucius over the coming months, however, was that he was excelling in the accelerated courses and was enamored with his schtappe just like many of the other blue priests. That, and Eglantine seemed to enjoy teaching him for the archduke candidate course, which seemed to put Anastasius in a perpetual terrible mood.</p><p>It bothered him that he could get no other information, especially as he got the sinking feeling that this was the opening move for Georgine’s end game.</p><p> </p><p>Two weeks after Hirschur returned to the Sovereignty, Ferdinand was summoned to Sylvester’s office where a glass of vize awaited him. Karstedt was already there, looking strained, as well as Florencia, who seemed exasperated. Once Ferdinand took his seat, Sylvester announced, “I…believe we’ve settled on a candidate for my second wife, depending on what Charlotte decides.”</p><p>“Charlotte?” Ferdinand asked. He could surmise that the candidate was either from or related to her retinue, but he wasn’t certain why a decision of hers would affect who the aub married.</p><p>Sylvester nodded. “I need to continue to ensure Ehrenfest with all its faction politics remains stable. My second wife will need to be able to work with Florencia, but she’ll also need to feel secure in her future so she doesn’t try to overtake my other kids with one of her own. However, any decision I make can affect the succession, so I need to know if Charlotte still intends to be aub. If yes, I’ll take Natalie, her guard knight, as my second wife. If not, I’ll marry Dorothea, Alexis’ sister.”</p><p>So Sylvester would use his marriage to declare his unequivocal support for one of his children to become Aub Ehrenfest, simultaneously ensuring both his wives would be treated well after his passing.</p><p>“I see,” Ferdinand said. “Not a bad move. I take it Florencia devised it?”</p><p>She gave him a small smile. “Yes, it took quite a while to narrow down options, have discussions with the potential candidates and their families, and trace all the ripples each choice would create to ensure the best possible outcome for Ehrenfest. We cannot afford to delay any longer, however, as we need to increase the size of the archducal family. With the threat of Ahrensbach still hanging over us, too, now is not the time for me to seek the blessings of Entrinduge.”</p><p>Ferdinand wondered what inspired them to have a child right after the purge in the previous weave while in this one they were avoiding doing so simply because of the possible threat of Ahrensbach. He’d heard that some men would receive the blessings of Brennwarme after those of Angriff. Perhaps that had been the reason.</p><p>After a short chat plotting out the timing for everything, Charlotte was summoned. She arrived with a calm smile on her face, but after training her for so many years, Ferdinand recognized the worry in her eyes.</p><p>“Charlotte,” Florencia said, “we’ve called you here to discuss your father’s second marriage.”</p><p>She relaxed a bit. “I’m ever so glad you’re getting married again, Father.”</p><p>Sylvester sighed as if to say, <em>We’ll see how long that lasts.</em> Leaning forward on his elbows, he said, “Charlotte, I want to support whichever of my kids decides to become aub. Wilfried doesn’t want to be aub but has to compete per a ditter contract. Rozemyne has never aimed for it. Melchior would rather focus on being High Bishop, but his attitude might change in the future. You have striven for the role your entire life, but your heart has been wavering lately.</p><p>“I say all this to say that if you do want to be aub, I’ll marry Natalie. If you don’t, I’ll marry Alexis’ sister. If Melchior decides he wants to be aub in the future, then we’ll look at ways to support him at that time.”</p><p>Charlotte cast her gaze down and tightened her hands into fists. Florencia gave her a sympathetic look while Sylvester waited on the edge of his seat for her answer. Karstedt was clasping his hands together, likely concerned about the future of the Knight’s Order.</p><p>After several tense moments, Charlotte looked up with firm resolve in her eyes as she said, “Then, Father, please marry Natalie.”</p><p>Ferdinand slowly let out the breath he hadn’t known he was holding. Aub Wilfried was a future he desperately wanted to avoid, especially as Hannelore, for all her pedigree, was not suited to being a first wife.</p><p>“I’m sorry you were not able to choose love,” Florencia said with a sad smile.</p><p>Charlotte shook her head. “No, Mother, I’ve chosen myself. I will not throw away all the years I spent studying, building my skills, making alliances, and struggling under Uncle’s tutelage for a man. If Bluanfah’s dance was truly so mesmerizing to him, then he could have given up his seat. I won’t give up mine for him.”</p><p>“Well done,” Ferdinand said with a smile, causing her to stare at him with a blank smile that failed to hide how dumbfounded she was. She deserved the praise, though. His Geduldh was Rozemyne, and he would happily follow her wherever she went so long as she would have him. Charlotte, however, had managed to differentiate between Bluanfah’s dance and Geduldh’s hearth - a task many failed, which often led to bitterness and regret.</p><p>He did disagree with her on one point - even if she were truly Lestilaut’s Goddess of Light, he couldn’t come to Ehrenfest. The first wife had no other children, and Ferdinand’s lack of impression of the other archduke candidates was proof positive they were unfit to be aub. Aside from that, he was already engaged, and he wouldn’t be able to bring a second wife with him. Breaking of an engagement to become consort to a lower-ranked duchy would be a political nightmare for everyone involved. That was aside from how wasteful the move would be given Hannelore was already coming to Ehrenfest. There was no political benefit to having two Dunkelfelger archduke candidates marry into their duchy.</p><p>With a nod, Sylvester said, “Alright. As future aub, let me give you this task - either select a consort this winter or find a way to put off Drewanchel another year. Understood?”</p><p>“Yes, Father.”</p><p>He dismissed her and then leaned back in his chair with a heavy sigh.</p><p>“Sylvester,” Karstedt admonished him, “did you just push your work onto her? Isn’t it your job to come up with ways to deter Drewanchel?”</p><p>Sylvester scoffed. “Yeah, it is, but I didn’t push anything onto her. I already have a plan. I want to see how the future Aub Ehrenfest would handle this sort of pressure from an upper ranked duchy.”</p><p>“I think it’s a fair test,” Florencia said. “One of her greatest strengths is forging alliances, and navigating this sort of situation will be all too common in her future. Even if she fails, it won’t negatively affect the duchy, so it will serve as a good learning experience for her.”</p><p>Ferdinand agreed, though he was discontent that it was a much milder version of Hasse, a challenge Rozemyne overcame when she was eight. He had to concede, however, that Charlotte was unlikely to ever commit the same blunders under the misconceptions Rozemyne did that led to the situation with the former mayor. Still, she would need to prove at some point that she could mercilessly tear down her enemies when necessary.</p><p>“Well,” Sylvester said, his energy waning, “guess I better get ready to talk to Natalie.” He reached over and squeezed Florencia’s hand, and as she gave him an encouraging smile, Ferdinand felt a pang shoot through his chest. Just the thought of sitting where Sylvester was, talking of a water goddess while holding Rozemyne’s hand, made his stomach churn and ugly feelings boil within him.</p><p>Guilt weighed on him as he realized that while he and Rozemyne had the mana to supply the entire country, his brother couldn’t supply a single duchy. While Ferdinand could remain true to his love, his brother was forced to take on a second wife when he desperately wanted his Goddess of Light to be his all goddess.</p><p>With a sympathetic sigh, he thought, <em>Heavy is the cloak that stretches across the sky.</em></p>

<p>Ferdinand could not believe he was about to do this. It was a terrible idea, but at the same time, he knew it was a necessary one. So much had happened that he needed to discuss with Rozemyne, but he dared not risk pulling her into his hidden room with Entrinduge visiting his attendant within a matter of weeks.</p><p>“<em>Stylo.</em>“</p><p>After gathering his resolve, he got down on his knees and began drawing a teleportation circle in the hidden room of his estate. Then, he moved over a few paces and drew another. As he was drawing the second, the first flashed, meaning Rozemyne had completed her side of it at the temple. It would be another week before she went home to the Linkbergs and inscribed the second one there. They would avoid putting any in the castle as Sylvester would notice the odd addition.</p><p>As he completed the other magic circle, Rozemyne arrived, a shameless grin on her face. “I’ve never sneaked into a boy’s room before!”</p><p>He glared at her. “First, I am a man, not a boy. Second, comments like that will make me erase these circles.”</p><p>“Wait, no!” she pleaded as she ran over and tugged at his sleeve. “Don’t do that! I promise I’ll behave!”</p><p>“You already promised that, and look how shamelessly you act at the first opportunity. I’m beginning to doubt my judgment. You must have clouded it far more than I’d realized.” He tapped at his temple and frowned at her. “The purpose of this is not to ‘sneak into each other’s rooms.’ It’s to discuss sensitive matters without casting doubt on your virtue.”</p><p>She cast her gaze down and muttered, “I know. I still think you should congratulate Janrik.”</p><p>“Why should I reward inappropriate behavior? Don’t tell me you congratulated Anneliese for her poor judgment.”</p><p>“Of course I congratulated her!” she huffed.</p><p>“Is this common amongst those in the lower city, then?”</p><p>Pressing a finger into her cheek, she tilted her head and looked up in thought. “I don’t know how common or uncommon it is since I was too sickly to really go out much. Even when I did, it was only to meet Benno who’s a forever bachelor and my craftspeople who didn’t have any sweethearts unless they were already married by the time I met them.</p><p>“Regardless, babies are cute, and if Janrik and Anneliese are happy, then this child should be celebrated! Don’t you think it’s sad that Aurelia and Lamprecht are hiding the birth of their child from everyone outside the family?”</p><p>“No, that’s standard.”</p><p>Rozemyne pouted. “In the lower city, they hold a big celebration and show the baby to everyone so that even if something happens, they’ll be remembered. I think it’s too sad that there are children who aren’t remembered by anyone but their parents and closest family.”</p><p>Ferdinand looked away, his emotions roiling. Did she feel the same about all the children born in Adalgisa? Had he fulfilled his purpose as a child of that villa, no one would have remembered him, likely not even the woman who’d given birth to him. He knew Rozemyne had told him in the past weave that he wasn’t meant to be a feystone, no matter how untrue that was, but he also knew she cared little for those she couldn’t see or spent a great deal of time with. As “compassionate” as the Saint of Ehrenfest was, she delineated cleanly between those she did and did not need, and she wasted no energy thinking of the latter. He felt it was a large part of why her engagement to Wilfried failed; she’d already cut him off before they were ever betrothed. Well, that and his retainers were incompetent louts that steered him in every wrong direction possible.</p><p>He mastered himself and stepped away from her, only to have her assault him with a hug. “Rozemyne!” he barked.</p><p>She just held him tighter. “If… If noble children are kept hidden, then that means I couldn’t show our child to…to…”</p><p>Grimacing, Ferdinand patted her back and said, “Did we not just establish that children are shown to family?”</p><p>“But…!”</p><p>“Rozemyne, think for a moment,” he said, placing his hand under her chin and tilting her head up to look her in the eye. “That contract you signed is only duchy-wide.”</p><p>Her brows remained knit together in confusion for several moments before she gasped. “So if I’m Aub Alexandria…!”</p><p>He nodded and tightened his arm around her. “Yes, you’ll be able to refer to them as family again. As aub, you won’t be able to see them as often as you would like, but you should be able to manage at least once a season.”</p><p>“How will we do it?” she asked. “Teleportation circles like these?”</p><p>“Yes, I believe that will work. We’ll connect your hidden room to their storage room. That will also allow you to change into commoner clothing without your retainers seeing.”</p><p>“But how will I take off and put on my noble clothes?” she asked. “They’re not designed to where I can do it myself.”</p><p>His ears burning, he turned away and said, “Do you not have a name sworn retainer you can order to silence?”</p><p>“I guess that’s true,” she admitted. After a moment, she started bouncing on the balls of her feet and exclaimed, “I think this is the happiest I’ve ever been! I get to see them again one day like I used to before! Oh, Ferdinand!” She buried her face in his chest and squeezed him hard enough to make him wince.</p><p>“Too tight!” he gasped. That was certainly not a problem he’d had to worry about in the previous weave. All that time she spent training with Bonifatius had not gone to waste, evidently.</p><p>She loosened her grip slightly but still refused to let go. “I almost want Gerogine to attack right now so I can steal Ahrensbach out from under her.”</p><p>“Rozemyne!”</p><p>“What? We’re in a hidden room! I can say what I want here. Mother told me so!”</p><p>“Well, so long as you understand that, I suppose.” He sighed and rubbed her back with one hand and played with the ends of her hair with the other until she released him.</p><p>They then both moved to sit on his padded bench to start the conversation they’d gone through all this trouble to have. “Speaking of Georgine’s attack,” he said, “I’m afraid she’ll move soon.”</p><p>“Why is that?” she asked.</p><p>Ferdinand told her about what Hirschur had said regarding Lucius, and his fiancée tilted her head in confusion. “Can someone so exceptional really have been hidden in the temple in Werkestock? They came through and tested everyone in the temples and took any with even laynoble-level mana, right? I know I was probably born with low mana, but I had to compress to survive, which is why my mana level is so high. A blue robe in the temple wouldn’t have had to do that, so his mana would have been high to begin with.”</p><p>Ferdinand nodded. “Those are my concerns as well.”</p><p>Frowning, Rozemyne called forth her Book of Mestionora and motioned for him to do the same. “Let’s see if anyone purged from Werkestock has any memory of this exceptional child being hidden away. Maybe he was related to Aub Ahrensbach’s second wife.”</p><p>They dug through their books, but as suspected, neither found any mention of a child who would match the description given.</p><p>“Is it possible he’s a Seed of Adalgisa?” Ferdinand mumbled to himself, feeling a cold shiver go down his back in response.</p><p>Rozemyne blinked at him for a moment before searching her book for the term. She skimmed over it as he prepared himself to pull back the veil on his memories before he was brought to Ehrenfest.</p><p>“It looks like Raublut stopped being a guard at that palace a while back, but he might have seen a boy that was taken from there. Hmm… He was an archnoble, so he should have memories in here, right?”</p><p>Ferdinand nodded and closed his book before thinking of Raublut’s passages.</p><p>It didn’t open.</p><p>Just to test, he thought of Gerlach.</p><p>It opened.</p><p>With growing dread, Ferdinand said, “Raublut may still be alive.”</p><p>“How?!” Rozemyne gasped.</p><p>Something tugged at the edge of Ferdinand’s consciousness, and he tapped his finger against his temple as he tried to follow that thread. He recalled Rozemyne and Matthias saying Grausam had faked his death. Searching through that man’s entry, he stopped as he came across a chilling entry.</p><p>Grausam had purchased as many devouring children as he could to test various hypotheses on. The most immediately important was that dyeing a person with the devouring would allow them to accept transfusions of blood from the person they were dyed by. By bleeding a victim who also had the Mark of Ewigeliebe and then transfusing his blood into them, Grausam was able to create clones of himself. It was a long and very painful process, but it could be done with a little as 20% of their blood being replaced. Grausam also found a way to increase his own blood supply without having to bleed himself. He would put a few drops in a jar, and with a rather complicated magic circle, the few drops would increase until it filled the container. There was a limit, of course, but the fact it was possible was as terrifying as it was intriguing.</p><p>He’d also shared this knowledge with Georgine, which explained her obsession with getting her hands on Rozemyne. Grausam had likely given her that particular poison that night to ensure she would have the mana clumps necessary for their cruel experiment.</p><p>Ferdinand explained what he found to Rozemyne but warned her not to look at the passages herself. “You…would not like what you find.”</p><p>A deep shiver shook her entire body, and Ferdinand wrapped an arm around her and drew her into his side. After a moment, she asked, “So Raublut used a clone to fake his death?”</p><p>“That seems the most likely explanation, yes.”</p><p>“Then what about this out-of-season consort of Detlinde’s?”</p><p>He tapped his temple with his free hand and pondered what to explain and what to hold back. “In the previous weave,” he said, “there was a man from Lanzenave named Gervasio who, with Raublut’s help, obtained the Book of Mestionora with the aim of becoming Zent.”</p><p>“Wow, I have so many questions,” Rozemyne said.</p><p>He sighed at the interruption. “Unsurprising. Ask them, or else we shall never be able to move on.”</p><p>“Well, first, why did a foreigner want to be Zent in Yurgenschmidt?”</p><p>He frowned and said, “He wanted to bring people from his faction over here to live for various reasons, one of which being the native people of their land began to develop anti-magic devices to fight back against them.”</p><p>“Ah, colonizers,” she muttered. “Alright, so why did Raublut help him? How did he even know him?”</p><p>This was the part where he would need to hold back the most, not necessarily because he didn’t trust her. He…didn’t want to think about it. He didn’t want to remember, and there were parts of himself he didn’t want anyone to see, not even her. Especially not her.</p><p>“As you already know,” he started, “he was a guard at Adalgisa. He was engaged to one of the princesses from there, but she…climbed the towering staircase during the purge.”</p><p>She placed a hand over his and looked up into his eyes with her penetrating, golden gaze. “Ferdinand, what aren’t you telling me?”</p><p>“It’s not relevant to the story.”</p><p>“But it’s relevant to you, isn’t it?”</p><p>Gritting his teeth, he said, “There are some things that must remain under the shroud of Verbergen, at least for now.”</p><p>She nodded and pulled away, her movements saying, <em>Oh, you still don’t trust me.</em></p><p>“It’s not that I don’t trust you,” he corrected her. “I am…not ready to talk about it.”</p><p>Her hand covered his again. “When you’re ready, I’m here.”</p><p>The warmth and acceptance that sentence promised made him want to fall victim to it, but now was not the time. They had more important matters to discuss, and he didn’t want to see the disgust on her face when he told her the entire story. “The man Ahrensbach sent off-season isn’t Gervasio, so we don’t need to waste time discussing him further.”</p><p>“Is it someone else from Lanzenave, then?” Rozemyne asked.</p><p>Tapping his temple, Ferdinand thought through the envoys and soldiers he recalled from the previous life that might have matched the description. There were a couple, of course, but no major players. Gervasio was much older and already had a schtappe. Leonzio had dark blonde hair, and he would have likely already tried to usurp the throne within a week of getting his schtappe, if not here, then in Lanzenave.</p><p>“It could be,” Ferdinand admitted, “but I’m not sure who it would be.”</p><p>“We might be able to find out more from Raimund this winter.” She pushed her finger into her cheek and closed her eyes as she thought. “I think we still have time so long as Aub Ahrensbach is alive. Since we haven’t heard anything, it’s probably fair to assume Georgine won’t be ready to move anytime soon. In the meantime, we should probably focus on preparing while we wait for opportunities to gather intelligence. And on that note, we should tell Sylvester about the clones to help him prepare. We should tell the prince, too.”</p><p>Ferdinand glared at her. Just what was this fool thinking? Had she forgotten that Sylvester was the only other one who knew they’d obtained their Wisdom? “And just how do you expect to explain to royalty how we came across this information?”</p><p>With a nonchalant shrug, she said, “Say you finally decoded some of the former Giebe Gerlach’s notes. I’m sure you could come up with a code that’s nearly impossible to crack, and you could say trying to figure out his research notes was a low priority since you thought between the memory reading and investigating his ingredients, you’d already found all the truly dangerous stuff.”</p><p>It…wasn’t a bad plan, but once again, it was full of holes. Still, the thought of a nigh-uncrackable code intrigued him. Ideas were already flitting through his mind between rotating number cyphers and constructed languages. After a moment, he shook his head to clear it and said, “It would take time to create the evidence, and it would not end with them wanting to see information on a single experiment given the nature of this discovery. They will want us to surrender all of his notes, and they will all have to be coded as well. Keep in mind we’ll also have to find a way to age the documents.”</p><p>Rozemyne sighed and looked down. “Might be easier to claim you found a hidden compartment among some of his belongings, then. I think we could get something like that made, not that I’d think they’d want to see the piece of furniture or storage box or whatever for themselves.”</p><p>“Hmmm… That is more doable. I shall consider it.”</p><p>She nodded and then started swiping at her Wisdom. “Let’s see… We should look for some magic circles that will help us boost our defenses. I know they have silver cloth, but we might still find something useful.”</p><p>“Can you not do something about that inefficient search method?” he asked. “You’ve seen how a proper Book of Mestionora should function. Is it still impossible for you to picture it going where you need it to?”</p><p>She waved him off. “It’s fine for now. We can look at that again later.”</p><p>Shaking his head at her, he started sifting through his memories of tactics they used in the previous weave. Could he prepare a magic tool that would summon winter around escaping boats, perhaps?</p><p>“Oh! Look at this!” Rozemyne exclaimed, pulling him from his thoughts.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“We should be able to make [#^*%}%% %*&amp;@$] with this circle. Um, that is, with this, we should be able to talk to each other even when I’m at the Academy and you’re here.”</p><p>He peered over at her tablet and then grabbed her wrist to bring it closer to his face as he scrutinized the magic circle. “Indeed, I believe this would…”</p><p>His words trailed off as he looked to Rozemyne only to find her face much closer to his than he’d anticipated. She had the most endearing shade of pink coloring her cheeks as her wide, moon-gold eyes stared into his. Goosebumps rose over his arms as the hair on the back of his neck stood tall, and his heart began to hammer in his throat. His mouth went dry as she seemed to come a hair’s breadth closer to him.</p><p>When he felt her breath ghost against his lips, he jerked back, releasing his grip on her and dropping his book to the floor. Covering the lower half of his face with a hand, he leapt to his feet and marched over to the other side of the room where he pressed his forehead against the wall.</p><p>What in the hell did he think he was doing? She’d just turned fourteen, thirteen in the eyes of the duchy. It’d be another two and a half years before he could even entertain the thought of such shameless behavior. She might have looked grown, but she was still a child.</p><p>He’d never felt so disgusted with himself.</p><p>“Ferdinand?”</p><p>He shook his head. He couldn’t face her.</p><p>“Ferdinand, I’m sorry. I…didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable. I know you, um, don’t like women, so…”</p><p>“What nonsense are you spouting now?” he said as he turned his glare on her. “While it is true I avoid women, it is because Veronica tried to use them against me as a weapon.” He looked away from her, his ears burning. “As you can see, it had the potential to be rather effective. Better to just distance myself entirely than fall victim to her schemes.”</p><p>“What an awful woman,” Rozemyne muttered. “At least if I had to lose the people important to me, she got locked away forever.”</p><p>That sent a pang of guilt through him. “Rozemyne, I’m still…terribly sorry about that. I swear, I’ll-“</p><p>“No, don’t be,” she said, holding up a hand as she interrupted him. “It was the only way for all of us to live, and I’m able to protect everyone more easily from this position. If you hadn’t found a good family for me here, I’d either be dead or a mana womb for some disgusting nobleman. …Or a Georgine clone, I guess.</p><p>“Either way, this is a much better life. I still have the people who are important to me, even if I don’t get to see them much. I have so many wonderful siblings between my four big brothers, my adorable little sister, and my two little brothers. Both of my mothers and fathers are good to me, and…and I have you as well.” She looked away, the color on her cheeks deepening. “You’ve always guided and protected me.”</p><p>While her sentiments warmed his heart, they only worsened his disgust with himself. He’d nearly hurt her by submitting to his basest of desires. Some protector he was. Gunther would rightly be calling for blood.</p><p>“I see what you’re thinking,” she said, “and you’re wrong. Wanting to kiss your fiancée is normal. …Assuming you wanted to kiss me, and you weren’t just disgusted by the idea.”</p><p>He scoffed but turned to the side so he wouldn’t have to face her. “Disgusted with myself, not you. My self control is severely lacking, apparently.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>An awkward silence stretched between them. He didn’t know what to say, either, so his discomfort continued to grow unchecked.</p><p>“You know,” Rozemyne said, breaking the tension, “I’ll actually be of age next year, so…”</p><p>Of course she would bring up the one thought he was trying desperately not to have. He pressed a hand to his forehead, pointed in the direction of the teleportation circles, and sighed, “Leave. I can’t handle being alone with you anymore.”</p><p>Her feet padded against the floor as she moved towards the circle, but before she left, she said, “See? I think you’re the one who needs to hold my name as a shield.” By the time he looked up to scold her, she was already gone.</p><p>He wouldn’t live to bind his stars to her. She was going to send him up the towering staircase long before he’d get the chance.</p>

<p>He was leaning over Rozemyne, his hand on her shoulder, trying to angle himself to get a better look at her Grutrissheit.</p><p>She turned her head to look up at him. Her warm breath fanned across his cheek. He looked away from the text to meet her wide golden eyes.</p><p>A blush stained her cheeks, and her tongue darted out to lick her lips leaving them as pink and shiny as a rose after the rain. He knew they would be as soft as a petal.</p><p>Her fragrance surrounded him, more heavenly than any flower, more intoxicating than any vize.</p><p>His gaze continued downward, following the graceful column of her neck to delicate collar bones framed by the lace edges of her dress.</p><p>From his high angle he could see a tantalizing shadow beneath the lace covering her bosom.</p><p>His brow furrowed. There shouldn't have been so much shadow there yet. She was only in her summer.</p><p>Her hand touched his cheek, and he could feel her mana caress his skin.</p><p>His eyes danced across her face taking in every detail as she leaned in.</p><p>They looked so similar. The differences between the ages were subtle.</p><p>Schlaftraum had blessed, or cursed, him with a repeat of the almost kiss with Rozemyne in his hidden room, only this time substituting a Rozemyne fully in her autumn.</p><p>He leaned forward, wondering even as he gave himself over to the dream if it was a mistake.</p><p>A taste sweeter than any dessert ever served bloomed in his mouth. Her mana mixed with his as he teased his tongue along her lip. Her mouth opened slightly as if welcoming him in. He eagerly deepened the kiss, pulling her tight against him on the padded bench.</p><p>His clothes felt uncomfortable against his hardened sword. Then suddenly, as was the sometimes helpful way of dreams, he was unclothed. Rozemyne was still pressed against him, now clad only in her bloomers and shift.</p><p>Even in his dream he wasn't ready to see her naked. It seemed somehow wrong to try to imagine her body using the information he had found in Grutrissheit. Besides, he knew whatever beauty the dream conjured would be a pale imitation of the perfection of form she would possess in her autumn.</p><p>Though he could not fully see her, he still ached to touch her. His hands rose to cup her breasts, enjoying how he could not fully cover them. He pushed them together and lowered his face into her cleavage, licking and kissing her soft skin.</p><p>Through her bloomers he could feel the waters of Flutrane coat her chalice. Sliding a hand down to her hip, he guided her to grind against his sword. The pressure was exquisite, and even in his dreams, the pleasure was too much to endure for long.</p><p>His mana swirled within him, and with a shout his snow shot out, splattering Rozemyne's undergarments. In the afterglow of his release, he felt languid. He smiled at the dream Rozemyne, but she was gone.</p><p>Ferdinand awoke in his bed with his release making his sheet stick to his stomach. Feeling unclean and embarrassed, he waschened himself and the bed to destroy any physical evidence of the dream.</p><p>Afterward, he lay in the dark reviewing the dream. Reliving every imagined moment. Knowing he would have to clean himself again, he reached beneath the bedding and began to polish his sword.</p><p>After his second release, he was able to fall into a dreamless sleep and awoke in the morning feeling unusually refreshed.</p><p>The relaxed feeling lasted until he saw Rozemyne standing, radiant in her summer beauty, bathed in the glory of the goddess of light. As the sun shone in her midnight hair, he knew giving himself over to the dream had been a mistake.</p><p>He had expected it to be just a pleasant dream. But that dream was now a memory. And he still had over two years before the actions taken in Schlaftraum's domain would see the light of day.</p><p>Ferdinand closed his eyes and prayed to Duldsetzen.</p>

<h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
<p>Two days after the disastrous hidden room visit, Rozemyne came to his estate to begin brewing the magical tools for the children Sylvester would be baptizing as wards. Thanks to finding more Georginians during the purge in this weave, there were far more orphaned or abandoned children in the temple than before, and several had the mana capacities to match at least mednoble level. Some even had the same amount of mana as many archnobles. There were only a handful that were too low in mana to consider baptizing.</p><p>Sylvester had decided to break tradition for the children who were over seven but could still store enough mana to attend the Academy the winter of their tenth year. They would be receiving baptismal rings in private ceremonies since they’d received the education expected of a noble. Unlike the temple priests and shrine maidens who were repatriated after the civil war, these children would participate in a special debut that would take place after the one held for newly-baptized seven-year-olds. They needed to show their faces to noble society, after all, and demonstrate their talents to prove they were deserving of the grace Sylvester was bestowing upon them.</p><p>In other words, Ferdinand and Rozemyne had an unreasonable amount of brewing ahead of them.</p><p>He couldn’t have been more excited.</p><p>After Justus pulled out the ingredients Sylvester had at last managed to acquire, Ferdinand and Rozemyne got to work sorting and preparing them, moving with practiced steps in a fluid dance they’d perfected over the years. As Rozemyne chopped and weighed ingredients, he readied feystones and drew a single copy of each magic circle they would need. Once she had completed preparing all the nebelbaum fruit, she took his magic circles and started copying and placing them onto the stack of magic paper he’d provided her. Sylvester had almost cried at the price, but the profits from the hand pump schematics in Drewanchel alone more than covered the cost.</p><p>When everything was ready, Ferdinand nodded for her to start adding ingredients as he stirred. After she added the last one, she drew the time-saving magic circle without needing to be prompted. When he nodded again, she drew a second, then pulled out a step stool and drew the third. It still took a significant amount of time to create the magic tool, but when he pulled it out and handed it to Rozemyne to inspect, she said, “Amazing as always! Will this be what our children’s magic tools look like?”</p><p>His ears burned as he scoffed and took the tool back. “Of course not. Any child of ours would need something of much higher quality. That was for a mere archnoble.”</p><p>“‘Mere’” she repeated with a giggle. “I think you’re just as out-of-standard as I am.”</p><p>That earned her a pinched cheek.</p><p>“Do not make me waste my mana having to heal you, fool,” he said after praying for Hielschmerz’s healing. “Ready the next ingredients.”</p><p>She gave him a little pout but did as commanded. This time, he had her add a fourth circle, and the brew was completed in no time.</p><p>When they finished with the archnoble tools, Ferdinand and Rozemyne switched places so she could make the mednoble tools and he could assess her brewing progress. She could handle using two time-saving magic circles at once, and Ferdinand despaired that she’d never progress to three given her lack of interest in brewing. Still, the mednoble tools required far less time, so it wasn’t a detriment to them.</p><p>As she stirred, she hummed an unfamiliar tune that he committed to memory to arrange later. It was an upbeat melody with similar patterns to others she’d given him. Apparently, many songs from the dream world followed the same or similar “chord progressions,” with different eras, genres, and countries favoring certain progressions over others.</p><p>Her humming suddenly came to a stop when the pot flashed, and when she handed him the completed magic tool, she asked, “When do you think we’ll have kids?”</p><p>Heat flared in his ears and neck as he immediately called for an area sound-blocking tool to be set up. “Fool, why would you ask such a question?!” he spat the second Justus stepped out of range.</p><p>Tilting her head, she asked, “What’s wrong? It’s no different than asking when we’ll get married.”</p><p>“It is different!”</p><p>“It is not! They both involve inviting Winter to some degree, right?”</p><p>He covered his face with his hand and sighed. This shameless girl! “Once things are stable, we can talk about it then.”</p><p>“So…maybe when I’m in my mid-twenties?” she asked.</p><p>Just how long did she expect it to take to get Alexandria to accept her as aub? Did she not collect allies like he collected ingredients? They would fall for her charms within a couple of years, especially when all of their lands began to proposer. The only concern he had in that regard was how they would react to becoming a library duchy. There was zero chance she wouldn’t turn the entire capital into a massive library and force Sylvester to sign a contract to give her all the books sent to Ehrenfest.</p><p>Regardless, he didn’t want to think about when they would have children. It made it too real, and just the notion of becoming a father filled him with terror and anguish. How could he be a father when his childhood was so disastrous and painful? He didn’t even deserve to hold an infant, much less act as a parent to one. Everyone had been shocked when Rozemyne had shown her attachment to him, and Sylvester had initially barred him from interacting with Wilfried because they knew any interaction between him and children would be traumatic for them. Even Rozemyne had called him a walking trauma factory and made a stuffed schumil to protect Letizia from him.</p><p>How could she even consider allowing him to be a father when he would just make their children miserable, resentful, and as broken as he was?</p><p>A hand on his arm brought him out of his self-loathing, and he looked down into moon-gold eyes filled with concern. “Ferdinand?”</p><p>He shook his head. “It’s nothing.”</p><p>Her look said, <em>It’s not nothing. You were thinking poorly of yourself again, weren’t you?</em></p><p>He scoffed and shrugged her off. “We have more tools to make. Stop wasting time.”</p><p>With a disappointed sigh, she turned back to the cauldron and got to work stirring the ingredients together. After her fifth tool, she asked to switch places with him, and soon enough, he lost himself to the brewing, enjoying her assistance as she added ingredients, drew magic circles, and organized the tools into neat rows. He was almost disappointed when they finished the last one.</p><p> </p><p>When Ferdinand and Rozemyne went to Sylvester’s office, they informed him the children’s magic tools were complete, and he scheduled a time to go to the temple to distribute them and talk with their new owners.</p><p>With that complete, Rozemyne left to meet with her downtown associates. She would be giving them a subtle warning to start getting ready to move. They didn’t know when Georgine would attack, but it would likely be soon, and Rozemyne wanted her family and Gutenbergs to come with her to Alexandria.</p><p>Once the two brothers were alone, Ferdinand told Sylvester what he’d discovered about the clones, and the man looked ready to die on the spot.</p><p>“What the hell even is that?” Sylvester asked as he held his head in his trembling hands. “So there could be dozens of fake Georgines out there? Was the Grausam we saw in the grand hall the night my daughters were attacked a fake, too? Was that what they were going to do with Rozemyne? I…I can’t… This is too much!”</p><p>“Sylvester, breathe,” Ferdinand ordered.</p><p>His older brother took several moments to calm down enough to get his breathing under control, though he was still shaking like a leaf under Stiefebrise. “All this to take the Foundation of a duchy that was so far beneath hers… Maybe if she put that energy to helping her own duchy, Ahrensbach wouldn’t be as bad off as it is.”</p><p>“Perhaps, but that is not the reality we’re dealing with,” Ferdinand sighed. “We need to be prepared to see several copies of Georgine. We cannot assume any that are captured or killed are the real one until we’re able to confirm it.”</p><p>“All this just as Aub Ahrensbach has fallen ill. Just what is she thinking?”</p><p>“The aub is ill?” Ferdinand asked, his heart in his throat.</p><p>“Huh? Oh, yeah. Just heard earlier today from Aub Drewanchel. He’d tried to reach out to him, but he was informed Aub Ahrensbach was too sick to even come to the mirror. Aub Drewanchel didn’t have a good feeling about it.”</p><p>So the ditter bell had rung. “She’ll be moving sooner rather than later. I don’t know if she will do it before or after the funeral, though.”</p><p>“The funeral. Of course. Why wouldn’t she plan to murder her husband as part of her crazy scheme to take my duchy? How utterly ridiculous,” Sylvester laughed. “Gods, and the former Sovereign Knight Commander had body doubles, too?”</p><p>With a sigh, Ferdinand nodded. “Most likely, though I do not plan to share that information with the royal family. As important as it is for them to know, I fear the consequences for Ehrenfest should I divulge it.” His, Rozemyne’s, and Ehrenfest’s safety mattered far more to him than the Sovereignty’s. The gods could step in if necessary to protect their garden, and he could always kill whichever Lanzenave plant Raublut put on the throne and make Eglantine take it instead.</p><p>Sylvester groaned and laid his head on his desk. “I don’t even know whether to say, ‘Good thinking,’ or ‘Are you an idiot?’ We’re so out of my depth. I’m starting to wonder if I’m blessed or cursed by Glucklitat.”</p><p>“Considering the advanced warning and our superior position,” and the fact Ferdinand was in Ehrenfest instead of Ahrensbach, “I’d say blessed. Now, stop fixating on frivolous thoughts and instead pay attention to what matters.</p><p>“I have trapped the entrance to the Foundation. Here are the magic tools that will see you safely through. There are enough for you and your children.”</p><p>“Huh? Where’s Rozemyne’s?”</p><p>Ferdinand narrowed his eyes. “I thought you would only want your children by blood to have access.”</p><p>“Uh, did you miss the part where I said she’s my daughter just like Charlotte? If something happens to all of us, I’d rather she be able to take the Foundation.”</p><p>He sighed and tapped the side of his head. “Fine. I’ll make her one.” He could always destroy it once she became Aub Alexandria.</p><p>“Here,” Ferdinand said. “These are masks that protect against airborne poison. If you get word the attack has started, put it on and don’t take it off until you’re certain all your enemies are dead or safely captured. Rozemyne, Wilfried, and Charlotte already have theirs. Keep it with you at all times. Here are amulets that also protect against poison, courtesy of Rozemyne.”</p><p>Sylvester’s eyes bugged. “Good gods, is that a rainbow feystone?!”</p><p>Ferdinand rubbed at the wrinkle between his brows and sighed. He’d told her not to waste such a high quality material when something much less valuable would suffice, but as always, she charged ahead without paying him any heed. “She insisted her family deserved only the best.” She’d even prepared protective charms of similar quality for her lower city associates and family. The amount of waste gave him a headache.</p><p>Shaking his head in disbelief, Sylvester picked up one of the charms and ran his mana through it, whistling at the magic circle that appeared. “That gremlin is something else.” Then, he slipped it on and put the rest in a pocket to distribute later.</p><p>“Any more mind-shattering news?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>With a sigh of relief, Sylvester stood and went to his liquor cabinet. “What do you say to a couple of drinks and some gewinnen, then? I could really use something relaxing and fun right now.”</p><p>Ferdinand smirked. “I don’t mind adding to my winning streak.”</p><p>“Ha! We’ll see how long that confidence lasts! I’ve gotten even better after playing Wilfried lately.”</p><p>Ferdinand left the office that evening with three more wins and zero losses under his belt.</p><p> </p><p>A week before Sylvester was due to go to the temple, Rozemyne invited Karstedt to meet her there to celebrate Nikolaus’ tenth year. He would be starting at the Academy in winter, so he would need to receive items such as study supplies and his highbeast feystone. Karstedt reluctantly accepted, leaving Ferdinand to train the knights with Bonifatius.</p><p>“That granddaughter of mine really dotes on her younger siblings.”</p><p>“Yes,” Ferdinand sighed as he watched his elite strike force run through complicated maneuvers.</p><p>Bonifatius snorted and then barked a rebuke at Matthias whose arrow had been a finger’s breadth from dead center on the target. “It’s a shame no one could talk her out of taking him as a guard knight. He has always demonstrated excellent skills whenever she brought him here to train, but being the son of that woman…”</p><p>“I’m well aware.” Ferdinand made a few motions to Cornelius, who shouted orders to the rest of his squadron before shifting to practice a different set of maneuvers. “Thanks to your training, however, she’ll be able to defend herself against someone as unskilled as him.”</p><p>“Of course! My granddaughter is amazing!”</p><p>He decided not to comment and instead asked, “Will you give him the same training you gave her other guard knights?”</p><p>“Of course!” he bellowed. “He’ll need to be able to properly protect her! It will also let me put the fear of the gods into him so he won’t even think about harming her.” He then took a deep breath and yelled, “Matthias! Now it’s too far to the left! Give me twenty laps! Damuel, watch and make sure he doesn’t use enhancement!”</p><p>Bonifatius must have really liked Matthias to go so easy on him.</p><p> </p><p>They had to handle the baptisms for the aub’s wards the same way they did for commoners. Several had turned seven in spring or summer, so they along with the children born in autumn gathered in the chapel for the ceremony. Rozemyne called each of them up by name and had them register their mana to citizenship medals before Sylvester declared them his wards and presented them a ring. They then offered blessings.</p><p>Once all of the children had received their rings, Rozemyne offered them an out-of-standard blessing, causing their eyes to shine like Hartmut’s.</p><p>With the ceremony concluded, the children left, and a few moments later, the older children who were past their baptismal year but not old enough to go to the Academy arrived. They had been vetted by Hartmut, and with the rejuvenation potions that Rozemyne’s, Wilfried’s, and Charlotte’s scholars made, they would be able to fill their magic tools with enough mana to attend the Royal Academy without issue. They followed the same procedure as before, and once they left the chapel, Sylvester, Ferdinand, Hartmut, and Rozemyne went to wait at the noble gate.</p><p>The children had already prepared for their exodus from the temple, so it didn’t take them long to arrive at the gate. Rozemyne made her highbeast large enough to carry them and their luggage to the castle. The children were evenly divided on whether they thought the oversized grun a was amazing or horrific, which concerned Ferdinand greatly. He didn’t want any more grun-shaped highbeasts flying over Ehrenfest.</p><p>They went to the castle first to drop off the girls. Norbert and several attendants took care of unloading their belongings and showing them to their rooms. After that, they took the boys to the training grounds where yet more attendants took care of settling the boys into the knight dorms, all under the scrutinizing eye of Bonifatius and Karstedt.</p><p>Nikolaus was among those being brought to the knight building, and before he was shown to his room, Rozemyne pulled him aside to ask him to look after Diedrich. He cheerfully accepted, seeming to delight in being relied upon by his older sister. When she reached up to pat him on the head, however, he blushed with embarrassment and ducked under her hand, saying, “Please, Sister. I’m too old for that…and there are too many people around.”</p><p>Rozemyne grinned at him and said, “So you’ll take head pats when there aren’t so many people? I’ll keep it in mind.”</p><p>“That’s…That’s not what I meant!” he protested, his eyes darting around to see who had overheard. When he noticed Ferdinand, who was fairly close by, staring at him, he looked horrified for a moment before his noble mask fell back into place.</p><p>“Sister, I-I-I have to go unpack. Please dismiss me!”</p><p>“Oh, very well,” she teased. “If I must.” With that, she waved him off with an indulgent smile. “Ah, he’s so adorable,” she cooed. “It truly is a shame he can’t live with Father.”</p><p>Karstedt coughed and looked away, his eyes betraying the shame his noble mask did not. “It’s…not that simple, Rozemyne.”</p><p>“I know, Father. That was not an admonishment against you, merely an expression of regret. I do not mind acting as his guardian as I already serve that role for several others. He is also less of a financial burden as you provide child support for him, which I am ever so grateful for.”</p><p>In this weave, rather than step back in order not to show favoritism, she brandished her role as guardian to justify covering her name sworn’s living expenses, urging them to save the money they earned for when they became adults. She’d then taken it upon herself to teach them basic business and investment strategies to increase their funds further. They along with Philine each had at least one small investment in a product she’d created, gaining a minuscule amount of profit from each sale that was paid out on a seasonal basis. Even that had evidently earned them quite a bit.</p><p>The only exception to this was Matthias as his brother took care of him, having become the head of their house and thus inheriting the former Giebe Gerlach’s wealth. While they no longer held the title of giebe, they were still rather well off. Matthias hadn’t even lived in the knight dorms for long as Janrik had quickly been able to purchase an empty estate with a garden soon after swearing his name to Ferdinand.</p><p>Over the coming weeks, Ferdinand received reports on how the boys were doing in the knight dorms as they fell under his jurisdiction as knight commander. Some had trouble adjusting at first, especially as they had to leave their gray-robed attendants behind. Rozemyne’s name sworn were helping where they could, but the burden soon fell to Roderick as Laurenz stepped away to help Bertram prepare for his baptism and debut since the young boy’s adoptive mother would be busy with a new infant.</p><p>It took every ounce of persuasion Ferdinand had to keep Rozemyne from showering Janrik’s new family with gifts when his son, Tobias, was born in late autumn. She’d still managed to get him to agree to sending some sweets and a relaxing blend of tea that supposedly helped with breastfeeding, however. Janrik, Anneliese, and Matthias were all moved by her kindness, which increased their loyalty even more, so Ferdinand let it slide without any lecturing.</p><p>Two weeks after the birth of Tobias, his mana tested at the low end of archnoble. Thus, at the beginning of winter socializing, Janrik and his house were elevated to archnoble status. Ferdinand received many untoward looks after the announcement, but he ignored them. What was done was done. While they could have waited until next winter to elevate Janrik’s status to save themselves the headache, everyone agreed it was more important to ensure Rozemyne had an older archnoble knight with her at the Academy. Ferdinand wasn’t sure what they would do the following year since a Nikolaus would only be a second year, and he didn’t know if Alexandria would be established by then.</p><p>As was custom, Rozemyne and Hartmut performed the winter baptisms. Among them were the orphaned and abandoned children from the temple who were born in winter, along with a redheaded boy named Diedrich. It seemed Sylvester couldn't justify leaving a devouring child with mednoble-level mana in the orphanage, and the boy expressed his desire to serve Melchior as a retainer and then High Priest. He was declared to be omni-elemental, along with a handful of other temple-raised children. Some had six elements, but no one had less than four.</p><p>This plot of getting the abandoned or orphaned children more elements had been an irrelevant scheme Ferdinand put in place on the off chance they would be adopted as wards again. It started as an experiment to further test how much mana and prayer had to be offered to gain divine protections. Hartmut was meticulous in his testing, recording the prayers offered, the divine instruments used, and the amount of mana given. He also set controls by having some children refrain from giving mana to certain divine instruments. Thanks to spending so much time praying in the temple, memorizing the divine protection prayer was easier for them than most third years. The hardest part was getting the lower-manaed mednoble children to fill the divine protection circle, but rejuvenation potions filled the gaps. Once Sylvester decided to baptize them, the experiment served to distinguish them as worthy of his grace.</p><p>The following harspiel performances further cemented that fact as they’d all been taught by Wilma or Rosina since they were taken to the temple. Even Diedrich played admirably as music was part of Rozemyne’s temple school curriculum.</p><p>During socializing, it quickly became evident the Leisegangs were only begrudgingly accepting of the new children of Ehrenfest, though their disapproval was much stronger for the older children who’d had to debut alongside the seven-year-olds since they’d been baptized late. Anything that stood in the face of social norms was hard to swallow, so even Rozemyne couldn’t truly fault them for their views. It still disgusted her, however, to hear adults speak ill of children because of circumstances beyond their control.</p><p>When Ferdinand escorted Rozemyne to the winter playroom, he hadn’t expected a rampage, but then he received word from Rihyarda that his out-of-standard fiancée wanted to take three of the newly debuted former Veronica faction children as retainers.</p><p>He quickly excused himself, marched down to the playroom, summoned Rozemyne, took her to a meeting room, and shoved a sound-blocking tool at her. “Explain.”</p><p>She tilted her head. “I know you value efficiency, but you really need to give me some context.”</p><p>Sighing with frustration, he asked, “What is this nonsense about you wanting to take more former Veronica faction children as retainers?”</p><p>“Aren’t you the one who keeps telling me I need more retainers? With three other archduke candidates and the size of our faction, it’s literally impossible to add any more retainers. I helped raise these children in the temple, and while I wasn’t there as often as I was before my jureve, I still know them pretty well, and I talked about them with my retainers at the temple who see them every day.</p><p>“Anyway, I need more guard knights and scholars. One of them is a girl that will start at the Academy next year and plans to take the knight course. The other two are only seven, but they’ve shown great potential to be scholars at the temple school. Their practice reports are already on the level of second-year students.”</p><p>That didn’t strike Ferdinand as too exceptional since Rozemyne’s temple reports were better than most adult scholars before she went into her jureve. Still, he had to admit that it at least set them at slightly above average.</p><p>“You haven’t approached these children yet, have you?”</p><p>She shook her head with a sardonic smile. “I only told Rihyarda, and I knew once she contacted you, you’d race down here. Having to suffer through the lecture for considering taking them as retainers is far more preferable to the one you would give me for actually taking them without consulting you first.”</p><p>He reached across the table and pinched her cheek, though only lightly.</p><p>When he returned to the grand hall, he sought out Hartmut and asked about the children Rozemyne was considering.</p><p>“Oh, those three, hm?” He got a sickening, reverent glean in his eye as he said, “They are all devout worshipers of our goddess, though their devotion pales in comparison to my own.”</p><p>
<em>Thank the gods for that, at least.</em>
</p><p>Hartmut continued, “Emilia came to the orphanage as a six-year-old. She was a reserved child who frequently cried herself to sleep, though she didn’t have any strong attachment to her family as they neglected her in favor of her older brother, who was executed alongside their parents. I found that rather odd since she has archnoble levels of mana, but perhaps her brother was simply that exceptional.</p><p>“Since her arrival at the temple, she took her studies seriously, which is more than I can say for some of the other children who came to us at that age. She seemed to enjoy physical training the most, so I’m unsurprised that she wishes to take the knight course.</p><p>“Ludolf was four when he came, and like the others, he had trouble adjusting at first. He had a much stronger attachment to his family. However, he came to accept his new circumstances within a year, and now if you ask him, he’ll tell you he doesn’t really remember his parents or his older siblings.</p><p>“He’s a studious boy who, along with Rainer, has been helping the blue priests with some of the simpler paperwork and checking over their math on occasion.</p><p>“Rainer adjusted to life in the temple the fastest of the three. Since he was born in winter, he was only three when we received him. Naturally, he was upset with his change in environment, as any child would be, but he was quite taken with Wilma, who resembled his mother somewhat with her similar hair color.</p><p>“He is perhaps the most intelligent of all the children from the temple, and his mana is on the high end of mednoble.</p><p>“Truly, I am impressed with my lady’s keen eye and excellent judgment. She so easily selected the best the orphanage had to offer. If I may be so bold, I would suggest letting her take these three, though you will want to check to ensure her finances will accept the burden of my lady’s generosity.”</p><p>Ferdinand tapped his temple as he thought over Rozemyne’s current funds, her income, her expenses, and the amount she would pay for the new children. He could see her developing three new lucrative products just for them to invest in, which would increase her funds even more. If she didn’t, she could still cover the cost, especially with the minimal child support Sylvester would have to provide her for taking care of three of his wards.</p><p>“Very well,” he said. “I shall speak with her about it again.”</p><p> </p><p>Later that night, Rozemyne was waiting for him in his hidden room, her arms crossed and a deep frown on her face.</p><p>With a heavy sigh, he sat in the chair across from the padded bench and asked, “What is it? Did I not approve your choice of retainers?”</p><p>“Yes, you did,” she said. “That’s not the problem.”</p><p>“Then what is?” he asked, rubbing at his forehead where a headache has been developing over the last couple of bells.</p><p>Rozemyne leaned forward and said, “I’m angry because you don’t trust me.”</p><p>“What?” he asked, completely flabbergasted.</p><p>“I told you Emilia, Ludolf, and Rainer would be exceptional retainers. And did you believe me? No! You wouldn’t give your approval until <em>Hartmut</em> said they were good.”</p><p>This was not how Ferdinand wanted to end his night. “You are soft on children. Therefore, a more objective perspective-“</p><p>“‘Objective’? Hartmut’s judgment is easily colored by people showing loyalty to me.”</p><p>That…was true, and he’d started by praising their devotion to Rozemyne.</p><p>“Besides,” she continued, “if I were all that soft, I’d have tried to take on more than three, wouldn’t I have? Instead, I picked those who showed excellent promise and would benefit me the most. Is that not how you taught me a noble acts? Have I not demonstrated my ability to act according to my station?</p><p>“Or can you not even see me because you’re too busy looking for the old Rozemyne who didn’t know even these basics of noble society?”</p><p>Ferdinand’s stomach fell to the floor as his eyes widened. Had he been treating her like the woman from the previous weave who was led completely by emotion without any regard for social norms? He thought he’d come to terms with the death of that Rozemyne, but perhaps spending so many nights reading through her memories made him conflate the two.</p><p>Or was he truly still searching for the Rozemyne he had lost, the one he’d fallen in love with first?</p><p>The young woman sitting across from him was almost a completely different person from the one in his memories. While she was the same on the inside, she was far more competent in navigating noble society.</p><p>So why did he need to seek Hartmut’s opinion?</p><p>He could say he wanted more details, but he hadn’t even asked her for any. He could say he wanted the opinion of someone who’d observed them more, but wasn’t that the same as not trusting her judgment when she said she’d already consulted her retainers?</p><p>She’d always been able to select the best retainers when she was given the choice, and even the ones everyone questioned most ended up being some of her most loyal followers. Nikolaus in this weave, for instance, was grateful to his older sister for doing what his father would not, and he was fully devoted to protecting the one who’d protected him. She had a talent for making people she invested time in achieve excellence.</p><p>“I apologize,” he said. “You’re…correct. I did not trust you, but I should have.”</p><p>Rozemyne sighed and at last uncrossed her arms. “I know you don’t trust easily. The fact you ate my food without worrying about poison so soon after we met shows you do trust me to some degree, but… Ferdinand, I don’t want to be compared to the other Rozemyne my entire life. I don’t want you to make important decisions like whether or not to trust my judgment based on her. I’d rather you not make any decisions based on her, but that might be too much to ask.”</p><p>“It’s not too much,” he said. “It’s the bare minimum. I can’t say I don’t think of her, especially when I’ve been reading through her memories looking for clues to help us in the coming battle, but I…</p><p>“I don’t see you as her, but you’re not wrong that I’ve tried to look for her in you. That was mostly early on, and I’ve long since stopped and instead came to appreciate the person you’ve become. You…” His ears burned as he looked away. “You are precious to me as you are.”</p><p>When he heard her sniffle, he instinctively reached for her and pulled her into a hug.</p><p>“Ugh, I’m so mad at you for making it impossible to be mad at you!” she cried.</p><p>He sighed as he rubbed her back. “That makes no sense.”</p><p>“It’s an emotion! It doesn’t have to make sense!”</p><p>He let her cry into his shoulder as he tried to process his own emotions. The most prominent was guilt - guilt that he was the cause for her tears, that he made her feel unseen, that he’d convinced her she wasn’t enough, that he’d made her believe he was still searching for the Rozemyne he’d lost long ago, that even after everything he still didn’t give her the trust she deserved.</p><p>Eventually, her tears stopped, but she didn’t let go. He let her sit for a while longer before he became uncomfortably aware of her breath on his neck and the position they were in. “Rozemyne,” he said, trying to convince her to move on her own, “let me heal your eyes.”</p><p>She sat up, but she didn’t get off his lap, and she kept her arms loosely tied around his neck.</p><p>“I can’t reach your eyes properly with you hanging on like this.”</p><p>Slowly, she released her wrists and dragged her arms back, though she left her hands on his shoulders.</p><p>That did not help matters.</p><p>He removed one of her hands and healed her, but she didn’t take the hint and move on her own. Instead, she stared into his eyes as if she could see his soul.</p><p>“Ferdinand,” she whispered, “what will it take for you to trust me?”</p><p>He closed his eyes and lowered his forehead to her shoulder. “Practice,” he admitted. “I trust you more than I’ve ever trusted anyone, yet as staggering as that amount is to me, I know it is not enough.” He hugged her around the waist and drew her closer, struck with the sudden fear that she would realize he was a worthless existence and disappear from his life.</p><p>She stroked his hair and said, “I know it’s difficult, given everything you’ve gone through, but you did say to let you know if you started falling into bad habits. Tell me, would you have even noticed the problem if I hadn’t brought it up?”</p><p>“…No.”</p><p>“Maybe next time, then, try talking to me first. Ask me if you want more details. If you’re not satisfied, at least let me know you’re going to talk to someone else about it, especially if that someone else is my retainer.”</p><p>He nodded against her shoulder.</p><p>When he lifted his head again, he found her much too close. Her eyes were searching for something in his. Was she trying to determine if he truly saw <em>her?</em> Was she looking for proof that he would one day trust her like she deserved?</p><p>Maybe she was simply trying to make sure he understood.</p><p>His thoughts immediately froze and his blood warmed as her hand dropped from his hair to cup his cheek.</p><p>“We’ll get there together, right?”</p><p>Get where? What had they been talking about?</p><p>She giggled and then leaned up. By the time he realized what she was doing, it was too late. She’d pressed her petal-soft lips against his forehead, causing him to freeze in place.</p><p>With another giggle, she hopped off his lap and beat a hasty retreat, wishing him Schlaftraum’s blessings before teleporting back to the Linkbergs.</p><p>“Schlaftraum, keep your damned blessings to yourself!” Ferdinand yelled as he began preparing the lecture on propriety he would give his wicked fiancée at the next opportunity.</p>

<p>Sylvester’s engagement ceremony with Natalie took place the next day. Their speeches to each other were fairly standard, and the air around them hinted at this being more of a political maneuver than anything else. It made Ferdinand think about what he would say to Rozemyne. At least he knew she would be able to understand it thanks to Elvira and Florencia.</p><p>He wondered if the words he’d written down the day he promised her he would protect their children would be meaningful enough to her. Would they convey the depth of his feelings and devotion? Or would they come across as trite?</p><p>Taking a deep breath, he tried to center himself and analyze his thoughts. If he thought about Rozemyne instead of his own insecurities, he knew the words would move her. She would understand what he was telling her.</p><p>What would she say to him, though? Would she repeat the declaration she made before the prince? What would her engagement stone say?</p><p>He cleared his thoughts as the ceremony concluded, and after Rozemyne congratulated her adoptive father and his new fiancée, he escorted her to the playroom.</p><p>“Will you approach them today?” he asked as they walked down the hall.</p><p>“Yes, though I feel a little guilty asking a recently-baptized child fresh from the temple to be my retainer.”</p><p>Ferdinand scoffed. “They received a noble education, did they not? They are also already familiar with retainers thanks to their experiences with gray-robed priests. Your request will not take them completely unawares.”</p><p>“I know,” she sighed, “and I definitely want to snap them up before anyone else realizes how amazing they are.”</p><p>They arrived at the door, and he murmured, “I will expect a report.”</p><p>She nodded and then entered the playroom. Immediately, she was greeted by the former Veronica faction children who’d debuted the day before, and seeing them gather around her while she bestowed warm smiles upon them made her look motherly in a way.</p><p>He spun on his heel and marched back to the grand hall, trying to leave the uncomfortable feelings that image evoked behind him.</p><p> </p><p>The day of Rozemyne’s departure came, and Ferdinand escorted her to the teleportation room. As always, he gave her a list of warnings, mostly about Ahrensbach, Klassenberg, and royalty, and as always, her eyes glazed over.</p><p>Maybe if this girl would listen and actually heed his warnings, he wouldn’t have to give her so many each year.</p><p>Still, he had to admit, she performed admirably well, especially when compared to the previous weave.</p><p>
<em>Stop, fool! You can’t keep comparing her to the Rozemyne you once knew.</em>
</p><p>Taking a deep breath, he started again. “Rozemyne, you’ll do fine.”</p><p>Everyone in the teleportation room stopped in place and turned to gape at him.</p><p>That brought him up short. For the reaction to be so pronounced… Had he never shown any faith in her before?</p><p>His near-perfect memory proved that no, he’d never demonstrated that kind of trust publicly. He’d always been quick to warn or admonish her, preemptively assuming she would fail.</p><p>
<em>How terrible of a fiancé am I that I hold the faults of a different Rozemyne against her?</em>
</p><p>It was another admonishment to add to the list that had been growing since his talk with Rozemyne. Once she pointed out that he’d been seeing her as the Rozemyne he’d lost, he’d caught himself at least a dozen times a day proving her right.</p><p>Rozemyne recovered first, warmth filling her eyes as they said, <em>You see me.</em></p><p>
<em>Yes, I do. I’m sorry I was blind for so long.</em>
</p><p>Her smile turned teasing as if to say, <em>If you ever put the blindfold back on, I’ll rip it back off, so you’d better be careful!</em></p><p>“Alright, alright,” Sylvester said. “You can stop flirting with each other already. It’s Rozemyne’s turn to go.”</p><p>Ferdinand glared at him, making him look away to avoid the lethality of his stare.</p><p>“I shall depart now,” Rozemyne said with a polite smile. “I look forward to when Dregarnuhr weaves our threads together again.”</p><p>“Yes, until then, Rozemyne.”</p><p>She then went and said her goodbyes to the rest of her family before teleporting out of his reach.</p><p>He couldn’t help but recall that in the last weave, Rozemyne had vanished at the start of the term, and he’d been desperate to find any information about her. It made him wonder what Hirschur would lure him with to help with her project this time since he would not be in the same dire straits this year.</p><p>Then again, maybe she wouldn’t need to force his assistance since Rozemyne had all the elements and would gladly assist for the small price of borrowing a book.</p><p>Wilfried was a bit pale as he bid his farewells, which let Ferdinand know they were planning to have him get the final two tablets, likely at the same time Charlotte obtained hers. If he got them before the mednoble Dedication Ritual, then he would fill Ewaermen’s magic circle and be able to gain his Wisdom.</p><p>Ferdinand could not believe he just thought that. Wilfried. <em>Wilfried</em> of all people getting the Book of Mestionora before any royal even took more than two steps on the path. He could not believe he was in a weave where Zent Wilfried had a non-zero chance of happening. What chaos had he wrought? No wonder Erwaermen chastised him for changing the weave too much.</p><p>Sighing, he shook his head at the notion that by the end of this winter, all except the youngest archduke candidate from Ehrenfest could theoretically hold the Book of Mestionora. The royal family would turn their entire duchy to sand if they ever found out.</p><p>He prayed to Verbergen that they never would.</p><p> </p><p>The first reports came after the Fellowship Ceremony. Wilfried’s letter, of course, still read like a different event from Rozemyne’s.</p><p>
<em>Father,</em>
</p><p>
<em>There were many more archduke candidates this year because after the joint research was published last year, archdukes started adopting more archnobles.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Maybe we should talk to some archnobles about adopting some of the mednoble children with archnoble-level mana. We don’t have very many archnobles, after all. I know that the kids from the temple are the children of criminals, but maybe if we could find someone to set an example - other than Janrik, who is also the son of a criminal, then more people would be willing to adopt.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I understand all of the reasons no one would want to do it, but I’m more concerned about our place as the Sixth, standing over a greater duchy, than I am about the feelings of people in the duchy. It’s like we have an enemy at our backs, and no one’s going to turn around to face them because they don’t like facing south. There’s only one ending to that battle, and it’s not one I want to see for Ehrenfest.</em>
</p><p>“That fool,” Ferdinand said. “The participation of three archduke candidates in temple ceremonies and a growing emphasis on religious rituals throughout Yurgenschmidt weren’t enough to change the minds of many about the temple. With what scheme does he expect to overturn basic societal norms and get archnobles to agree to adopt the children of criminals from the opposing faction?”</p><p>Sylvester sighed and rubbed the back of his head. “Yeah, I hear you, but he’s not wrong. We need to bolster our numbers somehow. The fact we imprisoned one of the Ahrensbach brides within a month of her arrival and appeared to put the other under house arrest didn’t convince too many to marry into Ehrenfest back during the purge, but if the Archduke Conference was anything to go by, we’ll be fighting them off. Still, I don’t know if it’ll be enough.”</p><p>“It’ll have to do,” Karstedt said. “There’s only one other way of increasing the population, and that won’t help matters for at least seven years.”</p><p>With a worried sigh, Sylvester kept reading.</p><p>
<em>Everyone was cordial, even the archnoble from Ahrensbach. Lady Gentiane is a new archduke candidate from Klassenberg, and she’ll be helping with the joint research on Dedication Rituals. Emmerick, the archnoble representative from Frenbeltag, talked with me about our joint research on harvest yields. We’ll meet later in the term to discuss it.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Overall, it was pretty uneventful.</em>
</p><p>
<em>—Wilfried</em>
</p><p>Rozemyne expressed a different opinion on a few matters. For one, she mentioned the changes announced at the advancement ceremony.</p><p>
<em>To my fiancé,</em>
</p><p>
<em>At the advancement ceremony, they announced changes to the curriculum. Classes are going to be teaching the same or similar content to what was taught before the civil war, and schtappe acquisition will take place in fourth year instead of first. They moved fast, didn’t they? Poor little Nikolaus was upset, but I cheered him up by promising him he’ll obtain a superior schtappe this way so long as he dedicates mana and prayer to the gods.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Surprisingly, Prince Anastasius was in a good mood. Since I saw Professor Eglantine wearing the hairpin we delivered to the prince this spring, I imagine Bluanfah has decided to stop withholding her blessings. He was very amenable to our party, which everyone took notice of.</em>
</p><p>Then, she discussed exchanging greetings with other duchies, and she did not get the same impressions Wilfried did.</p><p>
<em>The other duchies were polite for the most part, though Gilessenmeyer and Hauchletzte were cautious of us. They have no reason to be, though. It’s not as though Charlotte or Melchior will marry into the royal family, so our influence can’t be deemed greater than theirs, at least for this generation.</em>
</p><p>
<em>The archnoble from Ahrensbach, Martina, was as vile as you would expect. She didn’t ignore me like Lady Detlinde, nor did she speak over us. However, it was easy to see the insults under her sweet words. Only Wilfried missed it, but he kept stealing glances as Hannelore, so I can forgive him for being less observant than normal.</em>
</p><p>The only thing Charlotte’s report added was that Alaric of Drewanchel still seemed willing to let their threads cross, so she would try to strengthen Ehrenfest’s bond with that duchy as she felt it would benefit them the most.</p><p>Sylvester had a displeased frown on his face. “I know it’s her duty as future aub to select a spouse based on the needs of the duchy, but I do wish she could have a love match rather than a political one.”</p><p>“Perhaps she will with a second husband,” Ferdinand said with a shrug, “but there is no reason to assume she and the Drewanchel archduke candidate won’t at least be amicable with each other.”</p><p>“Says the man in a love match that will be spoken of in the Royal Academy for at least three generations.”</p><p>Ferdinand furrowed his brow at his brother, and he continued, “The perfect student who took first in class in every course every single year with a voice to melt women’s hearts leaves noble society and enters the temple, only to discover his Geduldh living in hiding. When he’s forced to send her away, Ewigeliebe covers her in ice, and she declares before those in the highest heights her unyielding love for her Dark God.” Sylvester couldn’t even finish the story without bursting into laughter.</p><p>“What nonsense are you spouting?” he demanded.</p><p>Sylvester contained his laughter behind several snorts as he said, “I’m practically quoting one of Lady Elantra’s novels. Apparently, the music teachers have been saying more or less the same thing since Rozemyne’s first year. It only gets worse at each Interduchy Tournament, too.”</p><p>Ferdinand turned his glare on Karstedt, but he looked away sheepishly, muttering something about women’s society and Elvira’s hobbies.</p><p>What a disaster. Did everyone have to compare him to Ewigeliebe simply because he gave his fiancée protection charms that matched her stunning beauty and a courtship necklace to ward off insects? It was just a hairstick and necklace. No one could even see the other charms. Rozemyne had practically covered his entire cape in protective magic circles, and yet no one accused her of being overly possessive.</p><p>In a fit of frustration, Ferdinand left the aub’s office.</p><p> </p><p>Thankfully, no word came of Wilfried getting the last two tablets before they finished performing all of the Dedication Rituals. However, they received plenty of reports about their academic performance. Once again, Ehrenfest students were all passing on the first day with high marks, even the laynoble first years thanks to a combination of temple school and updated curriculum in the winter playroom. Other duchies were performing well, too, with the sale of Rozemyne’s study materials, but their only true competitor was Drewanchel, but Ferdinand had no doubt Ehrenfest’s archduke candidates would be first in class again.</p><p>After Charlotte led the laynoble Dedication Ritual, she agreed to participate in joint research with Drewanchel, noting that her scholars would be doing the bulk of the work while she supervised, much as she did during their last collaboration. They would be continuing their studies on feyplant paper, this time incorporating types made from fey trees in Drewanchel.</p><p>One type would shuffle away if touched with even a small amount of mana, but it always moved towards a particular person, depending on whose mana was used. Adding mana when making the paper negated the effect for anyone but the original maker. They wanted to determine what qualities attracted the paper and how it could be applied.</p><p>Another fey tree made paper with elastic qualities. Depending on how thick it was, it could be stretched up to three times its length and return back to its original shape. Immediately, Charlotte’s scholars wanted to find a way to waterproof it or use it in textiles. They were also kind enough to send Ferdinand a few sheets of both types to research, and he promptly locked himself in his workshop each night for the following three nights.</p><p>The parts of the report that weren’t about research read:</p><p>
<em>Alaric continues to be amenable. He is a bit like Sister, however, in that when he’s conducting research, he blocks out everything else. I have come to check on the progress of our project on two occasions when he was in the middle of researching the stretchy paper, and he didn’t notice I was there. I later received letters from him apologizing for his rudeness.</em>
</p><p>
<em>We will have tea together once both of our practical lessons end. This will be the first time I will be able to have a proper conversation with him. I will learn what I can of him and seek to determine if he is what Ehrenfest needs.</em>
</p><p>Time would tell if she’d find him an agreeable partner or not.</p><p> </p><p>Ferdinand also started receiving reports from Raimund when his classes were wrapping up, mostly about the low-cost teleportation circles he was working on with Muriella. The truly important part was the intel he provided on his home duchy.</p><p>The lands were indeed flourishing a bit more, but Old Werkestock continued to be neglected, along with some provinces that bordered that defunct duchy. The new noble that would presumably be Detlinde’s spouse was unknown to all of Raimund’s contacts, but he’d seen him at the beginning of winter. Lucius “must have spent his life without speaking with nobles” as his understanding of euphemisms was a bit spotty. He also seemed to have trouble remembering most beyond the supreme couple and the exalted five.</p><p>And that was all the confirmation Ferdinand needed to determine Lucius was no blue priest. He was most likely from Lanzenave, then.</p><p>Yet he had returned to Ahrensbach rather than attempt anything while he was at the Royal Academy. Was he truly planning to marry Detlinde and be a consort? Or would he dye the Foundation like Detlinde’s sister did and work under the cloak of Verbergen?</p><p>Ferdinand couldn’t believe Lanzenave would settle for Ahrensbach alone, especially with Raublut still alive. What were they waiting for, then?</p><p>He went into his hidden room, pulled out his Wisdom, and thought of Gieselfried’s entry.</p><p>It didn’t open.</p><p>So they were waiting for him to die to take the Foundation. Once they did that, they would be able to travel to the Sovereignty via the Adalgisa palace. Had Raublut already obtained the key? Did he have a co-conspirator in the Sovereignty who would send it to him?</p><p>Either way, the result would be the same. He needed to step up preparations.</p><p> </p><p>It was two weeks later that Rozemyne wrote to let him know Wilfried had gotten all the tablets, and Charlotte had obtained five. Four days after that, the Lord of Winter appeared.</p><p>When the Knight’s Order arrived, howling winds buffeted them as heavy snow blocked their vision. It was worse than the schneestrum, but that had been the case since the northern provinces had started bringing spring early owing to the increased high-quality ingredients that attracted and grew more powerful feybeasts.</p><p>Ferdinand didn’t have time to waste on this thing. He needed to continue his preparations for Georgine’s invasion.</p><p>He called Karstedt over and told him, “We’re going to end this quickly. If the knights wish to gather ingredients, they shall have to move with Steifebrise.”</p><p>Karstedt raised a brow at him. “And if they aren’t able to?”</p><p>“Same as when we were gathering for Rozemyne’s jureve.”</p><p>The vice commander nodded, and they both began giving out orders. Many of the knights looked taken aback at the prospect of not being able to gather rare materials, but those who had been with them six years ago knew what to expect.</p><p>The archknights and Angelica followed Ferdinand into the storm. There were more of them now, accounting for more of Rozemyne’s and Wilfried’s guard knights being with them this time, and each was worth at least three ordinary archknights.</p><p>Cornelius and two members of his squadron waited high above while Leonore, Eckhart, Karstedt, Alexis, Lamprecht, and the rest of the strike force weakened the beast. Angelica used her superior speed to dart around it, attacking or cutting off pieces of it to use as materials. Ferdinand, meanwhile, charged an attack to go off the same time the strike squad hit.</p><p>When the first leg was severed, Angelica managed to harvest all five of its claws and a decent cut of fur before the limb disintegrated into snow and reformed on the feybeast. She repeated the maneuver each time a part of it was separated from the main body, obtaining over a dozen claws, meat, sinew, bones, and enough fur to make half a dozen capes before Ferdinand called for everyone to clear the area.</p><p>Cornelius led the other two members of the strike squadron down, and all three released their primed attack at the center of the feybeast’s back just as Ferdinand aimed his for its softer midsection. The four slashes of light meet at the center of the feybeast, splitting it in two.</p><p>The moment Ferdinand fired his attack, he dismissed his sword and summoned forth Leidenschaft’s spear, fully charged. When the halves of the feybeast hit the ground, he blasted forward, bellowing, “Shields!!”</p><p>Cries of, “Geteilt!” filled the air, and then he released the spear. It flashed down through the feybeast’s chest and exploded, knocking Ferdinand back over a dozen paces. When he recovered, he swooped down and retrieved the spear and the feystone it pierced.</p><p>It was extremely high quality, perfect for the life portion of an engagement feystone. He would have to pay even more to the Knight’s Order to keep it, but that was fine. Money was no object when it came to pleasing his all goddess.</p>

<h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
<p>When I lived with my mother, my only moments of happiness were when my father occasionally visited and my swordsmanship lessons. My mother had told me many times growing up that it didn’t matter what I did; my older brothers would always outshine me since they were the first wife’s children, but she would make them see how good I was. When my older sister, the child of the third wife, was baptized, things got even worse. I hardly ever saw my mother, and my father stopped coming so often.</p><p>Then one day, my older sister Rozemyne was attacked. My tutors whispered to me about how she’d gone to save her adoptive little sister, and she’d been poisoned and had to sleep in a special potion. I wondered if I had been attacked, would she have saved me, too?</p><p>For over a year, I begged for updates about her until Father came to visit and let me know my sister had finally woken up. I was so happy, even though I'd never met her before. My tutors had used the games and picture books she’d made that Father had brought me to teach me to read and do math. Those products and the snippets of stories I heard from the adults around me were all I knew about her, but I thought anyone who made such fun games was good and smart and would see how hard I worked and how good I was.</p><p>When the former Veronica faction was purged, my mother was taken away and punished. Then I was taken from my home and put in the temple, like all the other children who weren’t wanted anymore. It hurt that my father had discarded me, but I tried to hide it like a noble was supposed to.</p><p>My older sister could tell, anyway. She came to check on me after some gray-robed priests took me to my new rooms and measured me for blue robes. She praised me for my noble greeting and said she wanted to talk to me like family. It was all I ever wanted, so I said yes. Then, she said she would look after me as my guardian! When I asked about Father, she let her noble facade fall. She looked so sad, and that made me sad, too. I was so embarrassed that I had started crying, but she patted me on the head, passed me a sound-blocking tool, and said she’d made her retainers turn around, so I could cry as much as I wanted.</p><p>I never saw my father that much to begin with, so why did it hurt so much?</p><p>Cornelius glared at me whenever he saw me, but not my sister. She came to see me every day that she was at the temple, even when she didn’t have to. She would play games with me, join our harspiel practice, and sometimes invite me to lunch. None of the other abandoned children got to eat with her in the High Bishop’s rooms, but I was allowed to because she was my guardian. The first time, Cornelius complained, but she said it was no different than when she ate lunch with Lord Ferdinand when he was her guardian.</p><p>Whenever I did well, she would praise me, give me sweets, and pat me on the head. If I made mistakes, she would make me correct them, but she wouldn’t yell at me. Sometimes I got lonely, or angry, and the people taking care of me got afraid. When that happened, she sat me down and told me why what I did was wrong and then asked why I behaved poorly. When I told her it was because I got angry, she nodded like she understood and told me whereverI felt that way, I could stop what I was doing and go practice with my sword against the dummies she’d had installed behind the orphanage. I still got angry sometimes, but I didn’t yell at anyone anymore. I did end up getting really strong by going after the practice dummies so often. The exercise really helped me cool my head.</p><p>Sometimes, Father would come see me, but I knew Sister had set up the meetings. He was distant, and never looked at me warmly like Sister did, but he still got me a sword, a brewing set, a gewinnen set, and other things I would need for the Royal Academy when I turned ten. Sister gave me lots of books about feybeasts and strategy. She also told me that as my family, she would embroider my cape when I received it, though she teased me about how long I would wear it before I found someone else who wanted to embroider one for me instead. It was hard to imagine anyone but her caring about me like that.</p><p>When I arrived at the Academy, all the older students were there to greet the first years, even my sister and the other archduke candidates. Once we all got settled in, Lady Charlotte went over the rules for the dormitory, then Sister talked about the Better Grades Committee and the rewards we would get if we finished first or got the highest grades. After that, Lord Wilfried told us about the gathering spot, and then he and Sister led us out for our first gathering trip at the Academy. Before we started, Lord Wilfried and Sister transformed their schtappes into Flutrane’s staff and healed the land. Nearly everyone was struck speechless, but those of us from the temple weren’t nearly as taken aback. We’d seen the archduke candidates give blessings and perform rituals for years, so while the magic circle was pretty, watching them do the ritual was nothing new.</p><p>There were two other students who were first years from the temple like me, and we had all been afraid of how we would be treated once we came here, but it was just like the winter playroom, maybe better. Everyone was focused on doing their best and didn’t care about faction. The divide between arch-, med-, and laynoble was even less pronounced than we’d expected. It was true that there was still a gap, but archnobles and upperclassmen were quick to help med- and laynobles with content they were unfamiliar with or with gathering harder-to-obtain ingredients.</p><p>As my sister’s guard knight, I got to accompany her to the Fellowship Gathering. It was so cool seeing how Sister and the other archduke candidates interacted with royalty and the upper duchies. Even with the training I’d received in the temple, I realized there was still a large gap between my socializing skills as an archnoble and theirs as archduke candidates.</p><p>I was so nervous, but passing the first year classes was easy for all of us. Really, it was nothing compared to temple school. Rosina had us playing songs that third and fourth year students were being taught at the Academy, and Finn, one of Sister’s temple retainers, had already taught us everything we needed to know about history and geography up through the third year.</p><p>What wasn’t easy was having to let Sister go into the Dedication Ritual for archduke candidates and archnobles without any guards. I wanted to go with her because I was a blue priest myself. I didn’t know all the other students going in there with her, and I wanted to keep her safe, but as a first year, I couldn’t participate. I was already nervous, but Prince Anastasius was staring at me and Bertilde after Sister went in. He’d seemed nice enough during the Fellowship Gathering, but all traces of friendliness had vanished. It was like he was weighing us with that scrutinizing look, and we were failing.</p><p>Bertilde and I were both archnobles, though, so we didn’t shrink beneath his gaze. Eventually, he looked away and went into the room to participate in the ritual. When we followed her to the library with the extra mana in the chalice, the prince was practically glaring at all of us. Once Sister finished pouring the mana into the giant feystone, the prince said, “Stay vigilant.” Then, he left.</p><p>I looked at Laurenz and Matthias, but they just shrugged. Apparently, he always acted strange around Sister.</p><p> </p><p>Since we arrived at the Academy, Sister had been taking my cloak every evening and embroidering it for me, promising it would be done before the Interduchy Tournament. The other boy from the temple was jealous because he had no family to embroider his cape for him, but that was life for most people from the temple.</p><p>When Lord Wilfried noticed what Sister was doing, he asked her, “Hey, how come you never offered to embroider my cape?”</p><p>Sister smiled at him. “Dear Brother, have you forgotten that I was engaged before you got your cape?”</p><p>His face paled. “Ah, yeah. Uncle would have definitely killed me.”</p><p>That sent a shiver down my spine. The knight commander was terrifying, and just the thought of doing anything that would make him jealous turned my knees to jelly. Even I had heard whispers that he was so hard on Cornelius because he was protective of our sister. After the stories that I heard passed around the training grounds, I would never ever come between the knight commander and Sister. In fact, I would stand to the side and hold the door to his hidden room open for the two of them.</p><p>That was definitely bad for a guard knight to say, but only Angelica was brave enough to stand against the knight commander without any hesitation. I wanted to be as brave as her one day, but that bar was probably too high for me to ever reach.</p><p> </p><p>Both Sister and Lord Wilfried were taking two courses, so they took longer to complete their classes than Lady Charlotte did. She had already begun socializing by the time Sister was able to pass her scholar classes. Lord Wilfried would be taking much longer because of all the practicals that came along with the knight course, and those couldn’t be completed in a single sitting like the written tests.</p><p>That meant when it came time to start accompanying Sister to the library, anytime she wanted to go into the underground archive, Matthias or I would have to send an ordonnanz to Lady Charlotte to come take whatever tablet she was reading out of her hands and force her out of the barrier. The strangest part to me was that the shumils didn’t speak to Sister, but every time Lady Charlotte went in, they’d turn and say something to her. Matthias didn’t know what was happening either, but he said not to ask about it since it happened beyond a barrier we couldn’t cross.</p><p>One time, Sister asked Professor Adolphine to come with her so she could show her something, and the shumil talked to the librarian, too, but continued to ignore Sister. I think the professor noticed, too, because she gave Sister a strange look. When it was time to leave, we had to summon Lady Charlotte again, and when the shumils spoke to her, Professor Adolphine looked at Sister with alarm for the briefest moment. I didn’t like it. Matthias and Brunhilde didn’t, either, but none of us could say anything until we went back to the dorm.</p><p>Matthias asked if Sister would speak with us, so the two of them plus me and Brunhilde went into a meeting room while Laurenz and Judith guarded the door. After a sound-blocking barrier went up, Matthias reported to Sister what he’d observed.</p><p>Her expression didn’t falter, but she did pale somewhat. “I see,” she said. “Brunhilde, I shall send you to retrieve any reading materials in the future. Please always take at least two guard knights with you.”</p><p>That alarmed all of us.</p><p>“Sister?”</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne,” Brunhilde corrected me.</p><p>I didn’t care. What I cared about was that my sister was too scared to even send her attendant alone to the library. “What’s going on?” I asked. “What did those shumils say?”</p><p>She shook her head. “I can’t tell you. For now, I’ll focus on socializing. Brunhilde, schedule a tea party with Hannelore as soon as possible. Do I have any other requests?”</p><p>“Yes,” she said. “You received one from the Fourth and one from the Fifth today. Ahrensbach has sent another as well.”</p><p>“Decline it, but accept the other two.” She stood and said, “Ah, and Brunhilde, you may schedule time to meet with Hannelore as necessary. Please work with everyone to ensure your duties will be covered during those meetings.”</p><p>“I…thank you ever so much for your consideration, my lady,” Brunhilde said, crossing her arms over her chest.</p><p>“For now, I will go to my room to read. All of you, please focus on studying for next year’s courses or take advantage of Rosina’s presence to practice your harspiel. Ah, Matthias, you’ll be exchanging engagement stones with Lieseleta at the feast celebrating spring, yes? Are you prepared?”</p><p>His expression tightened as he nodded. “I am, my lady.” She’d already asked him about that when she finished her scholar classes. Why was she asking again?</p><p>“I am ever so glad to hear it. Nikolaus, I trust you will ensure you’re prepared for your second year. You wouldn’t want to lose the special recipe, would you?” She gave me her usual public-facing smile, somehow completely forgetting that I knew all the curriculum through third year thanks to her temple school, the winter playroom, and the Better Grades Committee. She then left and went upstairs.</p><p>With a difficult frown on his face, Matthias told Judithe to gather all of Sister’s retainers, and he gave them a condensed version of what happened. We all looked at each other with the same question in our eyes.</p><p>
<em>Who’s going to be the one to tell the knight commander?</em>
</p><p>“Yeah, none of the knights can do it,” Laurenz said. “We’ll die.”</p><p>“Well, I certainly can’t,” Brunhilde said. “He’ll kill Lord Wilfried.”</p><p>Bertilde nodded anxiously. “Since Lord Wilfried is my future brother-in-law, I also can’t send the report.”</p><p>“My deepest apologies,” Lieseleta said, “but as I’m betrothed to Matthias, I must also humbly step back from this task.”</p><p>All eyes fell to Gretia, Roderick, and Philine.</p><p>“I’m only a laynoble!” Philine quickly squeaked. “It is above my station to send a report to the knight commander when there are med- and archnobles among my peers.”</p><p>It was a weak excuse, and we all knew it, but I wasn’t going to say anything since Laurenz had saved my skin.</p><p>Roderick shook his head. “I can’t! He still sometimes trains Lady Rozemyne’s scholars! I’m just as likely to die! Gretia, you’re an attendant. He never sees you. You do it!”</p><p>She looked around at us anxiously, hunting for an excuse, before her eyes landed on Laurenz. They stared at each other for a long moment before she gave him a slight nod, and he gave her that smile I’d overheard the female knights talking about.</p><p>“I-I can’t b-because I’m being courted by Laurenz, and he’s a knight!”</p><p>Matthias gave an exasperated sigh as Brunhilde muttered, “You can’t decide on a partner based on not wanting to send a report.”</p><p>“I disagree,” I said. “Not when you’re sending a report to the knight commander about his fiancée getting involved in something troublesome.”</p><p>Laurenz shrugged. “Eh, I don’t care the reason. I’ll take it. I would’ve given my sword arm to have Gretia accept me.”</p><p>That made her blush furiously as she said, “You’re such an idiot!” before running from the room.</p><p>“There she goes again,” Laurenz laughed. “Adorable.”</p><p>“Save it for later,” Matthias sighed before silence fell over the room, and all eyes turned to Roderick and Philine again.</p><p>They both began to stammer frantically until Philine finally shouted, “Roderick is Lady Rozemyne’s head scholar at the Academy, so he should have to send the report!”</p><p>He looked utterly betrayed, and I pitied him. Not enough to volunteer to take his place, but enough to feel bad at least.</p><p>I decided to offer what assistance I was able. Channeling mana into my ring, I said, “May Roderick have the blessings of Grammaratur and Greifechan.” His head and shoulders drooped as green and yellow blessings rained over him.</p>

<h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
<p>I was the first third year to finish all of my classes. After the research on prayer and divine blessings, students could now choose to wait until the end of the term to acquire their divine protections so they had as much time as possible to pray. I, of course, needed no extra time. I increased my protections from 15 to 37. During the ritual, the statues of the gods spun to the sides, and a doorway opened at the top of the stairs.</p><p>Professor Hirschur sighed and said, “I suppose this will be the case for all of Ehrenfest’s archduke candidates from now on. Well, go on.”</p><p>I ascended the stairs and came to the tree where I’d obtained my schtappe. Placing my hand on the trunk, I called to Erwaermen, but of course, he didn’t respond. I hadn’t collected the tablets.</p><p>I looked around and realized that starting in three years, omni-elemental students would be acquiring their schtappes from here, and I didn’t think any of the professors knew. Considering it was a necessary step to becoming zent, I didn’t want to tell Professor Hirschur and put Ehrenfest at risk.</p><p>After offering a prayer to Ewaermen, I descended the stairs and left with the professor.</p><p> </p><p>The joint research with Drewanchel was going well. My scholars had found that cutting the stretchy paper into thin strands would allow someone to braid them like hair to make a small but flexible rope of sorts. Marianne sent several stands and a couple of sheets of the paper home to seamstress with an extra two sheets for Uncle to experiment with. It was only a couple of days later when we received a pair of socks with a thin braided cord of stretchy material sewn to the top. I went upstairs with her and watched her model them for us. They stayed up without being attached to her belt!</p><p>When I reported this to my elder sister, her smile deepened as her eyes sparkled. “Allow me to see these socks.” We took her upstairs to show her, and when she got her hands on the new material, her jaw dropped and her eyes widened with glee. “Charlotte! Do you know what this means?!”</p><p>I nodded, taking a step back. “Yes, it will be possible to forgo belts and string for-“</p><p>“No!” she cried. “This is the beginning of our undergarments revolution! Quick, Brunhilde! A piece of paper and a pen!” She then began drawing several sketches, giggling to herself all the while. When she finished, she displayed her finished work, puffing out her chest as she explained each drawing.</p><p>It was the most shameful thing I had ever seen in my life.</p><p>I was immediately intrigued.</p><p>“You see, if you add lace here and here, doesn’t it make such a pretty picture?” Sister said. “And see here, when it’s paired with a lace-adorned belt made with this elastic material, isn’t it just adorable?”</p><p>I nodded, feeling color on my face. “Oh, but Sister, is this not to help Geduldh beckon Ewigeliebe?”</p><p>She shrugged. “It certainly can be used that way, but a woman can wear these to feel blessed by Efflorelume without intending for anyone else to see.”</p><p>I placed a hand on my cheek and sighed. “Even so, I do not believe this will be popular among girls with unbound stars. Perhaps we should show these designs to Mother and Lady Elvira to get their perspectives as Light Goddesses.”</p><p>“I suppose you’re right,” Sister said. “I just want every woman to feel beautiful, but this may indeed be too much of a leap.”</p><p>As she passed her designs to Philine, I asked Marianne to find a way to incorporate the discovery in a piece of clothing we could show publicly at the Interduchy Tournament.</p><p> </p><p>The day for my tea party with Alaric came, and I went to the Drewanchel dorms to meet with him.</p><p>He had his shoulder-length purplish pink hair tied back, and his dark eyes were gleaming with excitement. “Thank you for coming today, Lady Charlotte,” he said. “Once again, let me apologize for missing the opportunity to talk to you when you visited the last two times.”</p><p>I smiled and shook my head. “Do not trouble yourself. My sister is the same way when it comes to books, so it is something I’m quite familiar with.”</p><p>“I thank you for the kind words.” He leaned forward and asked, “How is research progressing on your side of things?”</p><p>I placed a hand on my cheek. “My, you wouldn’t ask me to lift Verbergen’s shroud on a treasure so easily stolen, would you?”</p><p>He raised a brow and smirked at me. “You must have something quite interesting, then. Of course, you are the one who came up with the idea of recreating an entire ensemble with paper, so I’m not surprised you’ve conjured up another intriguing idea. I can’t wait to see it at the Interduchy Tournament.” He spun his fork around his thumb as he talked, but he stilled the moment he seemed to realize he was doing it.</p><p>“I’m sure our research will pale in comparison to yours,” I said. “I do look forward to seeing what you present.”</p><p>His grin broadened as he leaned forward and said, “I can’t wait to show it to you and hear your thoughts!” Then, he sat straight and cleared his throat. “Um, that is, since this is joint research, I’m sure you have some interest in the results.”</p><p>I lifted my teacup to my lips to suppress a giggle. He reminded me so much of Melchior when he got excited about his picture books and let his noble façade slip.</p><p>“I take it you will take both the archduke candidate course and the scholar course next year?” I asked.</p><p>He nodded, seeming happy with the change in topic. “Of course! I love researching new things, so I was always going to take the scholar course. I’m pretty excited about the archduke candidate course, too, though, since there’s so much that can only be taught there.</p><p>“Speaking of new things, these cream puffs are delightful.” He cut two of them open and stared at the different fillings, one with tanieh cream and one with a sweet pudding. “The things your duchy comes up with… I can’t wait to see what you’ll do with the new sweetener we’ve developed.”</p><p>My eyes widened, and he gave me another lopsided smirk, letting me know that was indeed a bit of information he let slip for free. I would have to tell Sister and Father about it so they could prepare for negotiations. Giving him a smile, I asked, “Has Drewanchel decided to rely less on sugar?”</p><p>He shrugged. “Prices have increased as Ahrensbach has started to receive fewer of Greifechan’s blessings from elsewhere.”</p><p>Raising my brows, I covered my mouth and gave a polite laugh. “Yes, many blessings can be lost when Ordoschnelli does not meet with Gebordnung but instead Chaocipher.”</p><p>“Well, perhaps Ordoschnelli will bring those blessings to Drewanchel and Ehrenfest instead,” he replied. With a wave of his hand, he called for the tea to be refreshed, and then a sound-blocking barrier went up. As he brought his cup to his lips, he asked, “Tell me, Lady Charlotte, how did you convince Aub Ehrenfest to let you into the temple?”</p><p>I mimicked his gesture as I replied, “I didn’t. My own participation started out of necessity, but my sister was made High Bishop after her baptism. When she was attacked and had to sleep in a jureve for a year, I started assisting with religious ceremonies to help fill the void she left behind. My brother and I were ordained soon after so that we could participate in the Dedication Ritual. I’m afraid it was all a rather natural process in a way.”</p><p>He looked disappointed. “I see. Though we know the importance of religious ceremonies, Drewanchel has chosen to focus on prayer and dedicating mana through charms and the like rather than visit the temple as ours…is not a place for children of the archduke to visit. Aub Drewanchel does plan to reform it, but he doesn’t believe it would be possible without a noble acting as High Bishop. There are not currently any adult volunteers for the role, and I fear he is not so open-minded as to allow children to fill it.”</p><p>That explained Sister’s report from last spring. “You have been dedicating yourself to prayer, though?” I asked.</p><p>He nodded and held up his wrist, showing me a bracelet filled with charms and pointing to each one as he explained. “Mestionora for wisdom and new knowledge, Gebordnung to help me keep my thoughts in order, Verbergen to keep my research hidden from thieving eyes, Anwachs for…obvious reasons.” His face flushed a light pink, and I couldn’t help but smile. He was rather short, but so was Sister when she was young. Anwachs would surely bless him as he did her. “Dregarnuhr so I can stop losing track of time so easily. Dauerleben so I…won’t leave my family too soon.” His eyes clouded over at that, and my heart hurt for him. “Anhaltung to let me find the right path. Glucklitat to assist me in overcoming my trials. And–” His voice cracked and he dropped his sleeve back over his wrist, but it was too late. I’d already seen the symbol for Liebeskhilfe.</p><p>If he’d told me he’d been praying to have his thread tied, I would have taken it as a poor attempt to flirt. Seeing him get flustered about it, though, was rather endearing.</p><p>“My, you truly are praying to many gods,” I said, trying to help him cover over his embarrassment. “I’m sure you will enjoy many divine protections next year.”</p><p>He nodded, his gaze fixed on the table. The gap between the confidently smirking boy from earlier and this shy shumil was adorable.</p><p>“Um, Lady Charlotte,” he said, masking his embarrassment with a noble smile, “I’m given to understand research isn’t a passion of yours. Are you perhaps more intrigued by the blessings of Kunstzeal?”</p><p>We talked a bit about our interests, and I discovered that rather than just research, he was fascinated by new things in general. After Ehrenfest’s visit last spring, he’d gone to investigate the lower city and spent several days silently observing commoners, stores, and workshops to see how interacting with our merchants might have changed things. He’d also participated in nearly all of the gathering expeditions meant to collect materials for new types of paper.</p><p>He was an observant, curious boy who embraced new ideas. Such qualities would fit Ehrenfest’s needs in the future as we continued to evolve, and his inherent enthusiasm would draw more people to follow him.</p><p>After our tea party, I received a small package from him that included two charms - one for Sehweit and one for Glucklitat. “So that you might receive the foresight necessary to see the trials awaiting you as aub and the strength to overcome them.”</p><p>As I slipped the charms onto the provided bracelet and had my attendant attach it to my wrist, I considered what it would be like having Alaric as my consort. I had confidence he could fulfill the duties required of him. I wasn’t sure about Bluanfah dancing for us, but we could at least form a strong partnership, I was certain.</p><p>I ran my fingers over one of the charms and smiled to myself. Then again, perhaps Bluanfah wasn’t so far as to need Sehweit to find her.</p>

<h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
<p>Two weeks after the Winter Lord subjugation, Ferdinand received a report from Roderick.</p><p>
<em>Lord Ferdinand,</em>
</p><p>
<em>It was reported to me by Matthias, Brunhilde, and Nikolaus that when Lady Rozemyne brought Professor Adolphine into the underground archive, the professor was surprised when the shumils did not speak to my lady. When Lady Charlotte entered, however, the shumils spoke to her, and Professor Adolphine looked startled.</em>
</p><p>
<em>None of us knows what this could mean, but again, according to the ones who were present, when they reported their observations to Lady Rozemyne, she became rattled and retired to her rooms, professing she would no longer go to the library.</em>
</p><p>
<em>If you need any more details about the situation, I implore you to seek Matthias, Brunhilde, or Nikolaus as they were the ones who observed it. I am only writing this report as her head scholar at the Academy.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Sincerely,</em>
</p><p>
<em>Roderick</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand furrowed his brow and pinched the bridge of his nose. Not only did the royal family most likely know Rozemyne held the Book of Mestionora, the retainers who had witnessed the incident had refused to write the report themselves. He didn’t know who he wanted to lecture first, but either way, he would show those “archknights” the meaning of fear. As for Brunhilde, he’d outsource her punishment to Rihyarda.</p><p>Sighing, he wrote a letter to Rozemyne in invisible ink and sent it that evening.</p><p>
<em>Rozemyne,</em>
</p><p>
<em>I hear you’ve possibly alerted the royal family to the fact that you have your Wisdom. What fortuitous timing considering we’re preparing to fight against an invasion from a much larger duchy backed by a foreign country.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Explain.</em>
</p><p>
<em>-Ferdinand</em>
</p><p>Her response came the next afternoon.</p><p>
<em>To my fiancé,</em>
</p><p>
<em>We already discussed that I would show the royal family where the shrines are. I invited Professor Adolphine to come look at the map of them in the underground library. I didn’t think about the shumils, but in my defense, I’ve been down there by myself every time I’ve gone, and it’s been a while since they stopped speaking to me, so I think it’s reasonable to forget such a minor detail. I simply don’t have the same perfect memory as my amazing fiancé who can do everything.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Oh, while I was down there, I found this magic circle you might find interesting. Please let me know if you find any novel uses for it.</em>
</p><p>
<em>-Rozemyne</em>
</p><p>Such a poor attempt to distract him. He’d had years down there, and he had a complete Book of Mestionora. The magic circle…</p><p>…was actually one he wasn’t familiar with.</p><p>He studied it for a couple of bells before putting it away and writing a response to her.</p><p>
<em>Rozemyne,</em>
</p><p>
<em>Has anyone approached you or sought an audience with you? If not, lay low and try to see what they know. Right now, they may merely be confused and not understand the significance of the shumils not speaking to you.</em>
</p><p>
<em>If they have discerned the truth, then lead Eglantine to her Wisdom. She already thinks of you as Mestionora. Perhaps you can play off that misconception. Act as though you yourself do not have the book, only the knowledge to obtain it.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Contact me the moment it seems that will not be enough to save you or Ehrenfest.</em>
</p><p>
<em>-Ferdinand</em>
</p><p>He’d spent so long looking at the new circle that he’d missed the cut off, so he had to send the letter out the next morning. It gave him enough time to write another three letters to each of Rozemyne’s retainers that had been with her in the underground archive, letting them know he found their lack of report <em>interesting.</em></p><p>The following week, he received a letter from Rozemyne saying Eglantine had invited her to tea. Naturally, she had to accept, and Ferdinand could barely focus for the following three days until her report at last came.</p><p>
<em>To my fiancé,</em>
</p><p>
<em>I had a tea party with Professor Eglantine today where I learned quite a bit of information.</em>
</p><p>
<em>First, and perhaps least important, she’s started to accept Prince Anastasius’s romantic overtures because she believes she’s found a path to peace. She was impressed with how he’s been seeing to his royal duties and has shown no antagonism towards the third prince. In fact, Prince Anastasius has been acting as a bit of a guide for him, similar to how Sylvester has Charlotte shadow him at work.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Second, she suspects I have the book, I think, but other than a preliminary probe, she hasn’t tried too hard to verify one way or the other. I can only assume it doesn’t matter much to her either way. She was able to obtain most of the tablets, but the amount of mana required to get them all is rather high, so it’s been a slow process for her. I told her the remaining two steps of praying to fill the circle and giving mana to the statue, as revealed to me by Mestionora.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She seemed delighted, and the tea party ended on a pleasant note. Crisis averted.</em>
</p><p>
<em>At least I can start going back to the library. I have so much lost time to make up for!</em>
</p><p>
<em>-Rozemyne</em>
</p><p>Sighing to himself, Ferdinand threw the letter in his crackling hearth and penned his response before going to bed. It was a simple note that acknowledged he received her letter and asked her to be careful. He simply didn’t have the energy for anything else.</p><p>Three weeks before the Interduchy Tournament, Roderick sent a message saying Rozemyne had been summoned by Eglantine. Ferdinand assumed the princess wanted to discuss the path to Wisdom. However, there was far more to it than that according to his fiancée’s report.</p><p>
<em>To my fiancé,</em>
</p><p>
<em>Yesterday, I was in the underground archive reading, and Charlotte went to play gewinnen with Lord Alaric again.</em>
</p><p>“Again?” Ferdinand wondered. “Since when has Charlotte even played gewinnen?” He shook his head. It didn’t matter. What mattered was why Rozemyne was summoned by royalty.</p><p>
<em>That meant Wilfried had to come get me. Professor Adolphine happened to be there, and the shumils didn’t tell him he needed more colors or prayer. This was obviously reported to Professor Eglantine, who summoned me to her villa today.</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand frowned. Had Wilfried obtained his Wisdom? When? Why hadn’t anyone reported as much? Had he done it in secret somehow?</p><p>His heart leapt to his throat as he read the rest of the panic-inducing report.</p><p>
<em>Professor Eglantine was not happy. She asked me if I understood the ramifications of having multiple people hold Grutrisshiet, especially when one was a royal and one would have the backing of Dunkelfelger since he was engaged to their aub’s daughter. When she expressed her fear that this information getting out could start another war, I explained that historically, all aubs held their own Books of Mestionora and that anyone with a seven-color schtappe, enough mana, enough prayer, and pure enough desires could obtain it. I also told her that as far as I knew, Wilfried didn’t have the book; he only obtained the tablets to increase the quality of his schtappe because his number of divine protections exceeded his schtappe’s ability to control his mana. Even if he did have it, he has neither the ambition nor the ability to rule and instead wants to be knight commander.</em>
</p><p>
<em>That seemed to put her at ease. She apparently only needs one more tablet and wants to wait until after the Archduke Conference to give her mana to the statue as I wasn’t able to tell her how long she would be gone.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She’s also chosen to keep this information to herself because she doesn’t want to give the zent false hope, and after learning that you have to have seven colors before getting your schtappe, she now knows she’s the only one in the royal family capable of getting it, anyway.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Crisis averted again.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Are you sleeping and eating well? Justus will tell me if you’re not. You have to take care of yourself so we can live together for a long time, okay?</em>
</p><p>
<em>-Rozemyne</em>
</p><p>Her meager attempt to distract him from the gravity of the situation only made his ears slightly warm. Once again, her letter left him so drained that he could only write back an acknowledgement and a plea to be careful.</p><p> </p><p>Before they traveled to the Royal Academy for the Interduchy Tournament, Ferdinand ensured everyone had their masks and charms with them and that those staying behind were fully prepared should anything happen during his absence. His heart was still in his throat as the black and gold lights enveloped him.</p><p>When they receded, three archduke candidates greeted him. Rozemyne looked tense, but that was to be expected.</p><p>What was not expected was how much difference a single season made in her growth. When he saw her on a regular basis, he’d hardly noticed the changes. After being separated from her for so long, however, it was impossible not to see how much she resembled the Rozemyne who had reached her autumn.</p><p>Good gods, she was only at the end of her fourth year. What idiot decided to make her pretend to be a year younger than she was? How was he expected to survive the next two years? He’d need to remove those teleportation circles as soon as he returned to Ehrenfest.</p><p>Justus coughed behind him, prompting him to step down from the circle and exchange greetings with his fiancé, niece, and nephew before retreating to the common room. “Right,” he said. “Justus, check in with the scholars. Janrik, the attendants. Eckhart, come with me. We’re going to pay a visit to the apprentice knights.” He then hurried off to where the students were training. When his eyes landed on Nikolaus, the boy visibly shivered before spinning around with his blade raised. The moment he recognized Ferdinand, his face paled. At least he had good instincts, even if he was a coward.</p><p>“Natalie!” he barked, and the girl came running.</p><p>“Yes, Knight Commander?”</p><p>“Report.”</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest and explained the training they had endured over the term, the studying they had done on feybeasts, and the strategies Matthias had devised. This had included the girls playing gewinnen so they could pick up on the coordinates faster. Charlotte had also participated in this part of their training to “encourage” them and not at all to improve her skills so she would stand a chance against the Drewanchel archduke candidate. Ferdinand nodded and then had Eckhart evaluate them. All the while, he avoided looking at Matthias or Nikolaus. The anticipation of his wrath would be worse than the wrath itself, and he planned to take full advantage of it.</p><p>When Wilfried finally joined them and announced it was time to do the pre-ditter ritual, Ferdinand gave everyone a cold smile. “You will not bring shame upon Ehrenfest this day, I trust,” he said, meeting each of their eyes for a brief moment. Even that much had felt like an eternity to his two targets, he was certain. He then returned to the common room to escort his fiancée to the tournament.</p><p>Once again, Florencia was paired with Wilfried, Sylvester with Charlotte, and Ferdinand with Rozemyne. As they settled in their seats, Rozemyne pressed a sound-blocking tool into his hand and asked, “You don’t suppose Lady Detlinde will bring her fiancé, do you?”</p><p>Ferdinand frowned. If this “Lucius” was from Lanzenave, his presence could prove troublesome. They would likely greatly resemble each other, and while no one else would know of the man’s true origins, Lucius would recognize Ferdinand’s immediately. Leonzio had been quick to pass that knowledge along to Detlinde. Would Lucius? If so, what would Detlinde do with that information in this weave? They were not engaged, so she had no reason or viable means to murder him this time. He was still in the way of the Ehrenfest Foundation, though, so Georgine might manipulate her daughter into taking some action against him still.</p><p>He didn’t have long to contemplate it as Aub Dunkelfelger, his first lady, and Hannelore approached their table. After they exchanged greetings, the aub leaned forward and said, “It’s a fine day, is it not? A fine day for a ditter.”</p><p>Ferdinand nodded. “Yes, you should be able to get your fill of speed ditter today.”</p><p>“Not speed ditter!” Aub Dunkelfelger protested. “Treasure-stealing ditter! Wouldn't you like to challenge us?”</p><p><em>Ah, so he's trying to get around not being able to challenge us by asking me to challenge him. The fool. As if I would ever do that.</em> Ferdinand shook his head. “I refuse.”</p><p>“But ditter!”</p><p>“I have nothing to gain, nor do I have anything to offer.”</p><p>“How about rare materials?”</p><p>“I refuse.”</p><p>Lady Sieglinde stepped in at that point. “Werdekraf, he has refused you. Do not continue to seek Angriff where he is not welcome.” She then graced Rozemyne with a smile and said, “We have brought another book for you to borrow.”</p><p>Her face lit up as she leaned forward slightly, her eyes glued to the massive tome as it moved between attendants before he was placed in her eager hands. “How lovely,” she sighed. “I look forward to reading more stories about the gods that Dunkelfelger preserved. I have already returned the book you lent me last year, but allow me to take this opportunity to provide the modern translation I and my scholars created. Of course, if you choose to publish it, it is subject to the same royalty fees as any other work.”</p><p>“Of course,” Lady Sieglinde said as her attendant performed the customary checks before giving it a cursory look. “Upon first glance, it seems to be as high quality as always. You overflow with Grammaratur’s blessings, Lady Rozemyne.”</p><p>“I thank you ever so much for the praise.”</p><p>She and Hannelore started a conversation as Aub Dunkelfelger said to Ferdinand, “You may have rejected my invitation to play, but I insist you come to our tea party room tomorrow evening to watch the ditter games we played both during your visit and Wilfried’s. I daresay you got to see little while you were tied up with Heisshitze. Surely you wish to see your fiancée’s and nephew’s performance!”</p><p>Ferdinand reluctantly accepted before the Dunkelfelger party went to speak with Florencia and Wilfried. The aub likely planned to corner Wilfried into accepting a game, but from the defiant gleam in Florencia’s eye, it seemed highly unlikely he would succeed.</p><p>Ferdinand almost sighed with relief at their departure. He’d managed to avoid playing ditter for at least one year. Hopefully, he could continue the trend for the rest of Rozemyne’s time in the Academy.</p><p>Aub Drewanchel and two of his archduke candidates, Ortwin and Alaric, meanwhile, had approached Sylvester and Charlotte, but it seemed their talk had concluded around the same time Dunkelfelger switched targets, so Aub Drewanchel was soon sitting across from Ferdinand, discussing the joint research on feyplant paper.</p><p>“Fascinating work your apprentice scholars did,” the aub said. “To use paper in clothing… I never would have thought of it. The idea of flexible waistbands is certainly appealing, especially as I get later into Autumn. You’ll understand one day, Lord Ferdinand.”</p><p>He smirked. “As knight commander, I doubt I’ll suffer from that particular struggle.”</p><p>The aub harrumphed. “True, true. You’re not so soft now that you’ve moved out from behind your desk. I’m certain you’re still finding time to brew, though, no? Were you able to experiment with the samples we sent you?”</p><p>“I had some time to do so, yes,” Ferdinand said. “It is interesting that with such a high water element, the paper itself is still somewhat water-resistant. Mixing alcohol into the ink for it was an ingenious idea on your part. That aside, I found brewing the paper with a feystone from a talfrosch made it completely waterproof, though the ink you sent would no longer write on it. I’ve sent a small sample to my fiancée’s exclusive ink craftswoman to see if she can concoct a dye that would adhere to the surface.”</p><p>“Hmm, so we could make completely waterproof books,” the aub muttered. “Since it’s so elastic, we could use it as a flexible cover to protect books and other items we want to remain dry. Of course, it’d have to be selective, since you’d have to worry about the humidity inside, but…”</p><p>“I have yet to see Drewanchel’s display,” Ferdinand said as Aub Drewanchel’s muttering died off. “Tell me what you’ve discovered about the shuffling paper.”</p><p>The aub looked to Alaric, the candidate they were pushing for Charlotte’s consort. The boy’s eyes glowed as he leaned forward and said, “It’s fascinating! If you pour mana into the paper, it will shuffle towards the person you have the most elemental affinity with. How quickly and how far it will move also depends on how close your quantity and colors are. The range depends on how much mana you pour into it, though it doesn’t work through ivory walls. In my tests, I placed a feystone filled with my mana on one of the pieces of paper and waited alone in my room for one of my retainers to sneak in. Sure enough, as soon as he was in the room, the paper started moving towards him, so if you’re the type to get fully absorbed in your work, it can be a nice alarm to let you know you’re no longer alone. However, if there are other people with you who match you closer than the intruder, then the paper won’t react to their presence at all. It may mostly be useful as a poor substitute for color matching while people are younger.”</p><p>Rozemyne tilted her head. “I don’t know. If we can find a way to refine that quality, it could help parents find their missing children, right? It would only work outside of the castle, sure, but if they end up running off while you’re out on a walk… Oh, maybe you could find a way to have it find missing objects? If you had a feystone with your mana across the room, would the paper be attracted to that feystone since it would obviously be the best match? If so, you could include a small feystone on easily-lost objects and the paper could point you in the direction of where your lost item is.”</p><p>The Drewanchel men all sat in silent contemplation as they toyed with her idea. Ferdinand immediately began constructing magic circles in his mind that would let him use the paper to track down Rozemyne.</p><p>She leaned over to him and whispered, “It might be a cheaper test, too, to see who should read a criminal’s memories.”</p><p>He nodded. It would at least be more efficient.</p><p>Their conversation continued for a while longer before the aub had to excuse himself.</p><p>It was at that point Sylvester sent an attendant over to inform Ferdinand that he and Florencia were going to visit Ahrensbach’s table. The aub wasn’t present, obviously, but Georgine and her daughter were. It seemed either Lucius and Detlinde hadn’t exchanged proposal stones yet, or they were afraid of exposing him to those who might recognize Lanzenave blood, such as an archduke candidate from the sixth-ranked duchy.</p><p>He decided to escort Rozemyne around the arena so they could see the various research displays. When they stopped to see Raimund’s and Muriella’s work on the teleportation circles, Fraularm glowered at them, unable to speak out against a higher-ranked duchy. It was amusing enough that Ferdinand had Rozemyne discuss several tools she wanted for her library and worked through a few preliminary ideas for making them a reality with Raimund. They stayed perhaps three times as long as originally planned.</p><p>Klassenberg’s research on dedication rituals wasn’t anywhere near as revolutionary as what Ehrenfest presented the year before, but they were able to show that the quality of mana didn’t differ greatly between mednobles and laynobles once it was added to the chalice, only the quantity. There was a quality difference between the mana collected from the archduke candidates and archnobles in comparison to the lower-status nobles, but it wasn’t as drastic as he’d have expected.</p><p>Frenbeltag’s joint research, however, helped explain the gap. It seemed on the surface that archduke candidates had a larger impact on harvest yields, even when the quantity of mana was the same. The true difference, though, seemed to be the sincerity with which they prayed. When Frenbeltag’s archduke candidates started participating in Spring Prayer, they saw an immediate increase in crop yields. However, after they started praying sincerely this past year, the yields increased even further.</p><p>Therefore, one could assume the archduke candidate and archnoble mana from the Dedication Ritual was of a higher quality not because of their higher status but because they had prayed more sincerely to get more protections. Since they already tended to boast more colors and therefore more divine protections than med- and laynobles, they likely believed they stood to gain more benefit and could reach double-digits with enough prayer. The lower-manaed nobles, who had between 1-4 colors, might have been afraid of quickly outstripping their weak schtappes or wouldn’t be able to fill the circle to gain many more protections, anyway.</p><p>Of course, that was mere conjecture, and unless someone interviewed the participants, there was no way to know.</p><p>Drewanchel’s presentation was exactly as they had stated during their visit that morning. Despite the students’ urging to test the shuffling paper out for themselves, Ferdinand refused and quickly led Rozemyne away before she could be tempted. The last thing he needed was for that party trick to reveal her dyed state and bring their virtue into question. Especially how much he was going to be struggling with her reaching her physical autumn in less than two seasons and her appearance already all but grown. It didn’t help that she, too, had enjoyed the natural blessings of Anwachs and with it Brenwarmme’s heat.</p><p>He sent a silent prayer to Glucklitat to help him overcome this impossible trial.</p><p>They went back to the dorms for lunch and then returned to watch Ehrenfest’s speed ditter. Professor Rauffen summoned their feybeast, a strong, rare specimen called a starktierger. It was a sizeable beast with thick, stiff fur that was mildly resistant to mana and physical attacks, mighty tusks protruding from its jaw and sharp spines along its back, and a heavy knot at the end of its tail that could cave in an unsuspecting victim’s skull.</p><p>Matthias recognized it instantly and began shouting orders. The female apprentice knights had an easier time finding their coordinates than in previous years, not that they got to display the new skill for long. While the older students distracted it, Nikolaus dived beneath the belly of the beast where its fur was the thinnest and rammed his sword up between its rear legs, using enhancement to push himself back towards its front until his blade reached its chest. Natalie wrapped him in bands of light and yanked him out of the way moments before the starktierger collapsed. It was only a breath later that it became a feystone, but it would have been a painful breath had Nikolaus not been pulled out in time.</p><p>The boy wouldn’t hesitate to do that, yet he couldn’t write a letter. What was Ferdinand going to do with him?</p><p>Other than have him and Matthias defend a ruelle tree by themselves on the Night of Schutzaria, of course.</p><p>When they came up to the sitting area and knelt before Sylvester, Wilfried reported, “Aub Ehrenfest, we have completed our speed ditter.”</p><p>“Yes,” he said. “You performed admirably. That was perhaps the fastest our knights have taken down a feybeast. Knight Commander, do you have anything to add?”</p><p>Ferdinand stepped forward and nearly smirked at how Rozemyne’s guard knights tensed. “You did not bring shame upon Ehrenfest. Indeed, the country should believe us worthy of being the Sixth. Matthias’s quick strategizing, Nikolaus’s bravery, Natalie’s reaction speed, and everyone’s willingness to follow orders saw you to a swift victory. I will be looking to see who will be the strategist next year.”</p><p>Their proud smiles turned to anxious gazes as the first through fifth years glanced at each other. Ferdinand knew one thing for sure - none of Rozemne’s apprentice knights would be filling the role. Wilfried would likely fill the gap, though Ferdinand wasn’t confident in the boy’s feybeast knowledge.</p><p>Sylvester dismissed the apprentice knights so they could prepare for the awards ceremony that was quickly approaching. It seemed no time at all until Ferdinand was bidding Rozemyne farewell and watching her fly away from him down to Ehrenfest’s circle. He doubted anything would happen, and he knew she was perfectly safe with all her guard knights, her brother, and her protective charms, but he couldn’t help but feel anxious with her so far from his reach after everything that had transpired until this point and the impending threat of Georgine hanging over them.</p><p>Forcing himself to calm down, he sat back and had a light chat with his brother and Karstedt while they waited for the royal family to appear.</p><p>Ehrenfest ranked second in speed ditter, lagging behind Dunkelfelger, as always. Ehrenfest was also involved in each of the three joint research projects that won awards, the one with Frenbeltag taking first, Klassenberg second, and Ahrensbach third. Wilfried, Charlotte, and Muriella represented them, respectively.</p><p>In addition, the duchy boasted a record number of honor students, and once again, Rozemyne took first-in-class overall, the archduke candidate course, and the scholar course. Wilfried took it for the knight course, and by the time his name was called, Ferdinand’s enhanced hearing picked up several cries of, “Ehrenfest <em>again?!</em>” coming not just from the students down below but the audience around them. Sylvester must have heard it, too, judging from the smug smirk on his face. They were almost groaning when Charlotte was named first-in-class for both third years and the archduke candidate course.</p><p>Rozemyne’s glide was as smooth as water as she crossed the stage and knelt before the king. He commended her for coming first-in-class for the fourth year in a row and for her part in the joint research projects. When she stood and turned to the audience, Ferdinand realized he’d been right the year before. Her smile damn near killed him. Would he have to skip the award ceremony for her fifth year? He certainly wouldn’t survive her sixth.</p><p>It seemed Alaric was suffering the same fate. Charlotte smiled at him as she passed by while he waited to be recognized for achieving first-in-class for second years, and the boy actually stumbled, his face nearly matching the color of his hair.</p><p>After they returned to the dorm, Sylvester announced to the entire room, “My children are amazing as always! First-in-class! Every single one of them! We couldn’t be more proud, right, Ehrenfest?!”</p><p>The room erupted in cheers.</p><p>“The audience was sick of hearing people from our duchy get called up! We swept the board once again! Ha, Dunkelfelger better watch out, or we’ll pass them up in ditter, too! Let’s keep it up! Make sure this momentum continues even after all our archduke candidates are no longer in the Academy!”</p><p>“Yes, Aub Ehrenfest!” the students shouted.</p><p>As Sylvester continued to brag about his kids, Rozemyne bounded over to him in the most elegant way possible. “Ferdinand! Ferdinand!” she chirped. “I got first in class! Praise me!”</p><p>He smiled at her and said, “Very fine.”</p><p>“Hey!” Wilfried called as he ran over. “I got first in class, too!”</p><p>“So did I!” Charlotte said.</p><p>“Yes, yes,” Ferdinand sighed. “Good job, both of you.”</p><p>“Eh? No, ‘Very fine,’ for us?” Wilfried asked.</p><p>Rozemyne puffed out her chest. “Ehehehe! Nope! Only for me! I got it three times!”</p><p>Charlotte frowned. “Well, I got it twice.”</p><p>“Which is still less than three,” her older sister tutted. “You have to go above and beyond for the patented, ‘Very fine!’”</p><p>Thankfully, they walked away as they continued their argument, though he realized too late that they were his only buffer to Professor Hirschur. The moment they were out of the way, she practically assaulted him, all but dragging him back to her lab to discuss research.</p><p>“Your fiancée was instrumental this year,” she said. “I was able to make my own Schwartz, though I haven’t presented him yet. I would like you to look over it with me. There are improvements to the design I want to make.”</p><p>With a sigh, he resigned himself to a night of fascinating research and brewing, wondering again if some things were preordained. By morning, they had a shumil that was pretty much identical to the one he’d helped her brew in the past weave, though this one’s speech was more fluid, and it had only basic defensive capabilities.</p><p>When he returned to the dorms, Rozemyne was waiting for him with a warm breakfast. “I thought we could eat before you went to take a nap,” she said.</p><p>He was so tired that he gave her a genuine smile as he sat down with her. “You’re up early,” he said.</p><p>She shrugged. “I asked Justus to send an ordonnanz when you were wrapping up. I’m glad you got to have some fun. It’ll…probably be the last time for a while.”</p><p>With a sigh, he picked up his cup of tea and looked into his shaking reflection. “Yes, I imagine things will move quickly.” After a long pause, he added, “I’m starting to doubt they’ll go the way I wanted.”</p><p>Rozemyne set down her fork and looked at him for a long moment, asking him with her eyes what he meant.</p><p>He passed her a sound-blocking tool as he spun his finger to tell Justus and Eckhart to turn around. After Rozemyne’s had done the same, he explained, “There were some very specific events that allowed you to take the foundation and be aub despite being underage, and I want to avoid one of the most prominent ones. We can discuss it later when I’m more rested and we have more time.”</p><p>She nodded her understanding. “Maybe after I return to the temple?”</p><p>“Maybe then,” he agreed.</p><p>They released their magic tools and told their retainers to face forward again as they ate in silence for a while. Eventually, the weight of his guilt became too great, and he muttered an apology to her.</p><p>“There are worse things than staying home,” she said with a sad smile. The next words were silent, <em>Like never being able to return.</em></p><p>He looked at her and took her hand. “I’ll find a way, Rozemyne,” he said. “I promise.”</p><p>“I know,” she said.</p><p>Lieseleta coughed, and Ferdinand quickly released her, feeling his ears burn. “Anyway,” he said, “I need to return to my rooms if I’m going to escort you to the sword dance and dedication whirl. I assume you want to watch Matthias perform.”</p><p>Rozemyne’s smile brightened, and he gave her a nod before heading off to get a bells’ worth of sleep.</p><p> </p><p>Ferdinand entered the common room at around the same time families of those graduating arrived. He spotted Rozemyne talking with Wilfried and went to join her.</p><p>“You look so dashing in your formal wear!” Rozemyne gushed over her brother. Then, she turned and greeted Ferdinand with a smile.</p><p>The boy blushed and crossed his arms. “Yeah, I know. I have to look good escorting someone with Brunhilde’s looks.”</p><p>That made the girl in question flush crimson. “Wilfried, your words are too bold once again.”</p><p>“Huh? What’d I say?”</p><p>With a heavy sigh, Leopold stepped forward and whispered in his lord’s ear only for the boy to go, “Huh? Really? But it’s the truth. Should I have said she’s blessed by Efflorelume instead? But you told me that was too much, too.”</p><p>Rubbing his forehead, Leopold screwed his eyes shut and muttered a prayer to Duldsetzen. “We’ll discuss it later, my lord, when there’s more time and fewer people around.”</p><p>“Alright. Anyway, don’t you need to go talk to your retainers or something?”</p><p>“You’re right,” she agreed. “But first…” She held out her hand, and Ferdinand escorted her over to Sylvester. “You can really see the resemblance between you and Wilfried when you’re both dressed in similar formal wear,” she observed.</p><p>Sylvester laughed. “Yeah, he definitely looks just like me. Congratulations again on all your awards.”</p><p>“I thank you ever so much for the praise,” Rozemyne said with a bright smile. “Be sure to escort Natalie properly, alright?”</p><p>With a scoff, Sylvester waved her away. “You think this is my first time escorting someone? Go talk to your retainer before we have to leave.”</p><p>“Fine,” Rozemyne sighed before steering Ferdinand over to Matthias. “Ah, you and Lieseleta look so good together in your formal attire,” she said.</p><p>“We thank you ever so much,” they both replied, their faces aglow.</p><p>“Remember, Lieseleta, you don’t have to retire the second you marry him if you don’t want to.”</p><p>The woman laughed. “As I’ve said before, Lady Rozemyne, I will continue to work for you until I am physically no longer able, and then I will return to service as soon as I can.”</p><p>“Besides,” Matthias added, “we won’t get married for another couple of years yet.”</p><p>Janrik said, “Anneliese is returning to your service as soon as Tobias is weaned as well. You’ve already set a precedent that will allow Lieseleta to only be away for a couple of years if she so chooses.”</p><p>Rozemyne sighed and placed a hand on her cheek. “I’m well aware. Forgive me for my selfishness. I simply don’t want to lose such a competent attendant.”</p><p>Laughing, Lieseleta crossed her arms over her chest and bowed to her lady. “I thank you ever so much, Lady Rozemyne. I look forward to serving you for many more years to come.”</p><p>“Rozemyne,” Ferdinand interjected, “it’s time to depart.”</p><p>“Thank you. I look forward to your sword dance, Matthias.”</p><p>“I will not disappoint you, my lady.”</p><p>Natalie’s and Matthias’ sword dance was impressive, though the latter filled Ferdinand with an odd sense of relief. While the girl had performed during the last weave, the boy had not as his attention had been focused on his lady disappearing for an entire term, and then he’d been scrambling to find an escort as a child with no guardian. Seeing him able to display the grace and agility his lithe form lent him, to smile at his intended when he descended the stage, and know his only concern was what torment his knight commander had in store for him confirmed that Ferdinand was indeed able to enact positive changes on this weave. Maybe he would still have the chance to take Alexandria. Maybe so many wouldn’t have to die this time.</p><p>The dedication whirl was the same as the previous weave, and as he escorted Rozemyne back to the dormitory, he wondered if that would be the last time he would be able to think anything was the same as before.</p><p>After they ate lunch, Rozemyne went to congratulate Matthias for graduating, and he offered her the highest form of gratitude, which she accepted graciously, only becoming slightly flustered. When he stood, she graced him with a genuine smile and said, “I truly am so proud of you, my noble guard knight. I am honored to count you among my most trusted retainers.”</p><p>For a moment, Ferdinand thought the young man would tear up, but he mastered himself and bowed. “No, Lady Rozemyne. The honor is mine.”</p><p>Janrik, however, had to step out of sight to hide his proud tears. Ferdinand sighed as he watched his attendant slip away. Ever since the man’s son was born, he’d become emotional. It was shameful, but Justus chided him for admonishing Janrik for his lack of composure. According to Justus, some men became that way after the birth of their children, but it would fade with time.</p><p>It was utterly ridiculous. The male body didn’t go through the changes the female body did during pregnancy and childbirth, so there was no reason for Ferdinand’s attendant to be affected to such a degree. Still, he understood his gentlemen’s education was yet…lacking, so he was willing to give Justus the benefit of the doubt in this matter. He would turn a blind eye to Janrik’s behavior for now.</p><p>Since Rozemyne wasn’t Matthias’s guardian in this weave, she wouldn’t be attending the graduation and would instead read. Ferdinand, meanwhile, would take another nap until Sylvester returned from escorting Natalie before they went to the Dunkelfelger tea party room that night.</p><p> </p><p>Ferdinand woke and entered the common room around the same time everyone was returning from the ceremony. Upon discovering Rozemyne had gone to the library to read, Matthias and Lieseleta left to attend to her. After Sylvester changed, it was time to go to the Dunkelfelger tea party room.</p><p>When they arrived, they were greeted with whoops, shouts, and several slaps on the back. Various cries of, “Wait until you see it!” and “You won’t believe it!” followed them in their much-impeded quest to reach Aub Dunkelfelger.</p><p>“Aub Ehrenfest! Ferdinand!” the man yelled. “Welcome once again! I do hope this becomes a yearly tradition!”</p><p>“Forgive me if I don’t agree,” Ferdinand mumbled, causing those in his vicinity to burst into laughter.</p><p>“You always pretend to hate ditter,” Heisshitze said, putting a hand on Ferdinand’s shoulder, “but how could someone who plays so often expect us to believe that, huh?”</p><p>He hadn’t played out of enjoyment, but there was no point yelling at the deaf.</p><p>“Now, Aub Ehrenfest,” Aub Dunkelfelger said as he pointed to the same couch as before, “join us as we watch your son face me one-on-one for an entire match and then take me by surprise at the end! You have some cunning children, but we expect nothing less from those trained by the Lord of Evil himself!”</p><p>Vize was poured, and the recording magic tool was turned on, displaying the match from their visit in the spring. Sylvester got just as excited as the rest of the Dunkelfelger knights, cheering, shouting, and leaping to his feet at the same time as them. He absolutely lost it when Wilfried produced multiples of Leidenschaft’s spear.</p><p>“Now,” the aub announced, “onto the matches young Wilfried fought alone under Leidenschaft’s unforgiving rays!”</p><p>Ferdinand leaned forward, excited to see what the future knight commander was capable of on his own. Rather than go to retrieve feybeasts for treasure, Rarstark and Wilfried protected their fiancées as neither had any allies to act as guards. Rarstark charged down the field towards Hannelore, who braced herself behind her shield as she held her schtappe at the ready. Wilfried came down on the man with a charged attack, knocking him back by over a dozen paces. He followed that up with a handful of explosive magic tools, two of which let out a cloud of paralyzing dust.</p><p>Rarstark, however, had seen the trick before and held his breath until he was free of the cloud before barreling towards Wilfried at full speed. A bright flash filled the screen as their charged swords met.</p><p>The light, however, didn’t fade fully. It took a moment for Ferdinand to realize that was because the light was coming from above him. He looked up as sparkles fell over him from a white blessing floating over his head.</p><p>The room fell silent as they all stared at the bizarre sight until it dissipated. Sylvester grabbed him by the shoulder and hissed, “What the hell was that about?”</p><p>Ferdinand frowned, hoping the blessing wasn’t from Beischmacht and trying to banish any thoughts of how such a blessing would come into being. “I’m not sure,” he admitted. “There’s only one person it could have come from, and she is supposed to be reading at the library.”</p><p>“Wouldn’t the library have closed by now?” Sylvester asked.</p><p>“Yes, I suppose it would have, about half a bell ago.”</p><p>“How very peculiar,” Aub Dunkelfelger said. “Do you often receive blessings in Ehrenfest?”</p><p>Ferdinand waved him off. “It happens upon occasion when our archduke candidates get overly emotional.”</p><p>The aub raised a brow and then laughed. “Perhaps your fiancée has developed a new recipe she wants you to try.”</p><p>“Perhaps,” he agreed, hoping it was indeed Cuococalura’s blessing.</p><p>As they resumed watching the recording, a frantic knock came at the door. The Dunkelfelger knight commander went to investigate and then rushed back inside with Matthias following close behind.</p><p>Ferdinand’s stomach sank when he saw the boy’s –man’s expression. He immediately marched over and demanded, “Report!”</p><p>Looking around anxiously, Matthias handed over a sound-blocking tool and covered his mouth. “Lord Ferdinand, Lady Rozemyne has been taken by the royal family.”</p><p>“She’s <em>what?!</em>”</p><p>“As we were preparing to leave the library, a group of Sovereign knights came and told us to follow them. When Lady Rozemyne asked for an explanation, they said she’d received a royal summons but wouldn’t elaborate further. All of her present retainers had to come, too. We were then taken to Prince Sigiswald’s villa, and they said she would be questioned by the prince, and when she asked to contact her guardians, they put schtappe-sealing cuffs on her. That was when she sent me the signal to come here.”</p><p>For a moment, Ferdinand couldn’t breathe. They had taken her from him. They were holding her prisoner. That fool of a prince thought he could take <em>his</em> Rozemyne and hold her in captivity, did he? What a fool to think he could play Ewigeliebe.</p><p>That was when it struck him. Rozemyne had sent him Ewigeliebe’s blessing to let him know she was trapped.</p><p>“How did you escape?” Ferdinand asked.</p><p>Matthias patted his chest, indicating the presence of an amulet underneath his armor. She’d evidently given him the shroud of Verbergen and told him to activate it at some point, allowing him to run away undetected.</p><p>The edges of his vision dimmed as he tried to get his racing heart and thoughts under control. The color continued to drain from his face as he realized he might very well lose Rozemyne if he didn’t take drastic action. He only had two options, and one was more likely to succeed long term.</p><p>Quickly, he beckoned Sylvester over and handed him a sound-blocking tool before he grabbed him by his shoulders, stared into his eyes, and said, “Sylvester, I need your help.”</p><p>His brother paled as he nodded. “Of course. Anything. What do you need?”</p><p>“I need your permission to do something utterly devoid of Gebordnung.” As Ferdinand explained his plan, Sylvester paled further.</p><p>“Good gods, man,” Sylvester whispered. “That’s your plan?!”</p><p>“It’s that or take the country’s Foundation myself.”</p><p>Sylvester’s knees visibly trembled as he shook his head. “I’ll petition Zent directly to release her. There’s no way he knows what Prince Sigiswald is doing.”</p><p>“Sylvester, you can contact him if you want, but please,” he begged. “There’s no telling what that man is doing to her with how desperate he evidently is to be named heir.”</p><p>His brother ran a hand through his hair as he let out a long breath. “Gods… Yeah, okay, but you better not mess this up.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Ferdinand said, crossing his arms. “And worry not. I never fight battles I cannot win.” He took back his sound-blocking tool and marched back over to where the Dunkelfelgerians were waiting. He stood before their aub, crossed his arms, and said, “Aub Dunkelfelger, I challenge you to ditter.”</p><p>The room was silent for only a breath before it erupted in a cacophony of fevered celebration.</p><p>The aub’s face glowed brighter than the light of Rozemyne’s blessing. “What are the stakes?!” he yelled, trying to be heard over the chaos surrounding them.</p><p>Closing his eyes for a brief moment, he looked at the aub and said, “If you win, Aub Ehrenfest will cancel Rozemyne’s adoption so that you can adopt her instead. I will then marry into Dunkelfelger.”</p><p>That sent the men around them into a frenzy as a burning determination filled Aub Dunkelfelger’s eyes. “And what do you want?”</p><p>He passed him a sound-blocking tool and covered his mouth. After taking a deep breath, he said, “If I win, I will take you down the path to obtain the Grutrissheit.”</p>

<p>“Aub Dunkelfelger, I challenge you to ditter.”</p><p>
<em>Did my ears deceive me? Did Ferdinand really just challenge me to ditter? The Lord of Evil who never challenges anyone?</em>
</p><p>Everyone erupted in cheers as a grin stretched across my face. I knew this man had ditter in his blood! He loved it just as much as any Dunkelfelgerian! Why else would he accept so many of our challenges, brew so many evil tools, concoct such dastardly tactics, and fight so hard on the field? I should have known this was coming! He always played hard to get, acting taciturn to our challenges as a means to up the stakes. As a true lover of ditter, he wanted that potential prize to drive him to new evil heights!</p><p>If only he were born in Dunkelfelger! It was such a waste that he’d been taken to Ehrenfest. Then again, even the finest vize tasted plain if you drank it every day. The yearly wait between our matches made them all the sweeter.</p><p>“What are the stakes?!” I yelled.</p><p>It was so obvious to me now. He’d taken our right to challenge him from us so he could be in control of when we played. That way, he could wait for the perfect time and use our desire to meet him on the field to manipulate us into accepting higher stakes!</p><p>I couldn’t wait to hear what ridiculous boon he’d want this time!</p><p>He closed his eyes for a brief moment as though savoring the words on his tongue.</p><p>What a master of manipulation, using even this small act to increase our anticipation!</p><p>“If you win, Aub Ehrenfest will cancel Rozemyne’s adoption so that you can adopt her instead. I will then marry into Dunkelfelger.”</p><p>
<em>Did my ears deceive me, or did he just offer Dunkelfelger our greatest desire?</em>
</p><p>Lightning raced through my veins as the exhilaration threatened to overwhelm me. With a stake like that, he was going to ask for something absolutely ridiculous in return.</p><p>I didn’t care. I was absolutely having this ditter!</p><p>“And what do you want?” I asked, excitement and dread filling me in equal measure.</p><p>When he passed me the sound-blocking tool, the dread overtook the excitement just a little. When he covered his mouth, it overtook it by <em>a lot.</em></p><p>“If I win, I will take you down the path to obtain the Grutrissheit.”</p><p>My jaw dropped as I gaped at Ferdinand. Surely my ears had deceived me this time. Surely he had not said I would have to obtain the Grutrissheit. Surely he hadn’t insinuated he knew where to find it this entire time but hadn’t told the royal family! Surely, surely, surely…</p><p>“Do you have it, then?” I asked. Surely the answer was no. Surely.</p><p>A line appeared between his wrinkled brows. “Knowing the path is not the same as walking it,” he said.</p><p>That wasn’t the denial I was looking for!</p><p>I couldn’t believe it. It seemed Ventuchte had just as much of a mischievous streak as Liebeskhilfe.</p><p>Any aub from a top-ranking duchy would know at first glance that Ferdinand was from Adalgisa, meaning his veins were thick with royal blood. It was almost unheard of for a boy to be taken from that palace, but the previous Aub Ehrenfest had plucked him from the field of sweet-smelling flowers to give a competent minister to his less competent son.</p><p>When most heard about the aub’s bastard son, they found it somewhat peculiar that a man who wouldn’t take any other goddesses would have an affair. I, however, understood. When the royal family summoned you to <em>participate</em> in their <em>trade deal</em> with Lanzenave, you went. It wasn’t necessarily strange that he’d sired a son in Adalgisa. What was strange was that he’d come back to claim him. It was by design, after all, that he wouldn’t truly know if the child was his. Being able to tell yourself the boys born to be turned into feystones belonged to someone else made the burden easier to bear.</p><p>Whether he was the previous Aub Ehrenfest’s son or not, he was more or less a hidden royal with the Grutrissheit.</p><p>
<em>How do I respond to the new piece he just placed on my gewinnen board?</em>
</p><p>I didn’t even consider withdrawing - this ditter <em>was</em> happening, one way or another. The stakes, though, carried a far greater weight than most could even imagine. Regardless of whether I won or not, the Grutrissheit was in play, and Dunkelfelger would support whichever of us claimed victory.</p><p>This ditter could be the spark that would light the flames of another war.</p><p>I glanced over to check Aub Ehrenfest’s reaction. He was sending off an ordonnanz, obviously telling their people to start preparing for the ditter of their lives. What a respectable man he’d become! I gave a signal to Heisshitze to start our own preparations.</p><p>Despite the thrill coursing through me, I needed to do my due diligence. One did not step onto the ditter field unprepared.</p><p>Placing my hand over my mouth, I asked, “Why haven’t you told the royal family?”</p><p>The wrinkle between his brow became more pronounced as he said, “The only one of them capable of obtaining the Grutrissheit was shown the path three years ago. I cannot be held responsible for their incompetence.”</p><p>“Wait, which one was it?”</p><p>He shook his head. “That’s not relevant right now.”</p><p>“I beg to disagree,” I said. “With stakes like these, I can’t afford to go in blind.”</p><p>He stared at me for a long moment before he said, “Princess Eglantine.”</p><p>Well, that was only the <em>second</em> worst person it could possibly be. Not only was she incapable of running a country, she was also unmarried. That meant the battle she’d avoided with her adoption for her hand would start anew, but it wouldn’t just be the princes competing this time. Duchies would be entering the fray.</p><p>Prince Sigiswald was already making moves to impede the budding romance between Prince Anastasius and Princess Eglantine since their marriage could cement him as heir. Just how far would he be willing to go if she ascended the throne?</p><p>I was pulled from my thoughts as the knights to my right parted, making room for Sieglinde. She leveled her weighty gaze on Ferdinand, her face a stony mask. “Lord Ferdinand, it simply will not do to discuss ditter terms under the shroud of Verbergen.”</p><p>“Sieglinde,” I said, deactivating my sound-blocking tool, “they’re not something we can discuss openly.”</p><p>A terrifying brow creeped up her forehead as she raised her hand, dismissing everyone save essential personnel. She waved for her head scholar to set out parchment and ink before motioning for us to join her at the table. Just as Aub Ehrenfest was joining us, an ordonnanz flew in and alighted on his arm. “We will speak with you tomorrow afternoon.”</p><p>Was that the zent’s aid?</p><p>The aub’s face reddened with anger, but he set aside the yellow stone and focused on the task at hand - writing out the terms of our ditter.</p><p>A sound-blocking barrier went up, and each of us ordered our retainers to turn around. “Now then,” my wife said, “what are the stakes?”</p><p>As Ferdinand repeated them, she sat frozen for a moment, her hand twitching toward her pouch of feystones, but she got control of herself almost immediately. My valkyrie had always been a formidable woman.</p><p>“So you seek to put my husband on the throne rather than lead the current zent to his Wisdom?” she asked.</p><p>Aub Ehrenfest crossed his arms while Ferdinand shook his head and said, “The king is unable to obtain it. As I told Aub Dunkelfelger already, only one member of the royal family is able to gain their Wisdom. They’ve known the path for three years and have yet to make adequate progress.”</p><p>“I see,” Sieglinde said. “You understand, however, that one cannot hold two foundations.”</p><p>Aub Ehrenfest shot back, “We understand your son is of age, and the previous Aub Dunkelfelger is still alive and well. He or one of your brothers can act as relay aub until Lestilaut is ready to take over.”</p><p>That man had pouches of Beischmacht forged by Vulcanift. He didn’t back down even as Sieglinde showed him her annoyance.</p><p>“Why can’t anyone else in the royal family gain their Wisdom?” Sieglinde asked. That was the real question. How was I qualified to get the Grutrissheit when nearly none of them were?</p><p>“You have to have a seven-colored schtappe,” Ferdinand answered.</p><p>“No wonder,” I muttered. “There are only a handful of people in Yurgenschmidt who fulfill that requirement. The only ones are…” My voice trailed off as my eyes widened. I looked Aub Ehrenfest and Ferdinand in the eye and saw the tension they tried to hide. My suspicions were correct.</p><p>I began to chuckle under my breath. “I see. We’re not deciding <em>if</em> this is happening, just <em>who</em> will do it.”</p><p>Siegline raised a brow at me. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“Don’t you see?” I asked. “Either I obtain the Grutrissheit and approach the royal family, or someone from Ehrenfest will. I’m right, aren’t I, Ferdinand?”</p><p>He remained silent, which was all the confirmation I needed.</p><p>“The only way for us to see our way out of this is to win this ditter and take Rozemyne for ourselves.” I nodded to myself. “I see. So that’s your master plan. If you win, I take the throne with Dunkelfelger’s and Ehrenfest’s backing. If I win, you or Rozemyne with your seven-colored schtappes will take the throne, also guaranteeing our backing. This is the kind of scheming I would expect from the Lord of Evil!”</p><p>Sieglinde was less amused. “It wouldn’t be him. It’d be Rozemyne. If she obtained the Grutrissheit and revealed herself as an Ehrenfest archduke candidate, the zent would order them to demote her to an archnoble and then marry her to whichever son he preferred. He wouldn’t dare do that to us, however, hence the adoption.”</p><p>Ferdinand looked at the table, resting his forehead against his laced fingers to hide his expression. It seemed even he couldn’t maintain his composure when Ewigeliebe saw Flutrane preparing to take Geduldh from him.</p><p>He still didn’t look up when he finally said, “Time is of the essence. Do you accept my terms or not?”</p><p>I almost shouted, “YES!” just so we could hurry up and start dittering, but Sieglinde’s eyebrow twitched in annoyance. I deflated a little as I pushed down the urge to yell my acceptance. “Before we decide,” she said, “tell us what happened to spark this challenge.”</p><p>The two men across the table exchanged a look before Ferdinand answered, “One of the royal family has taken Rozemyne and put her in schtappe-sealing cuffs.”</p><p>I leapt to my feet, knocking my chair back. “Without contacting Aub Ehrenfest?!” I yelled. They couldn't just take an archduke candidate without contacting their aub. Unless she’d personally sent one of them to the towering heights, there was no excuse for this!</p><p>Ferdinand nodded at me, a dark look in his eyes. “That blessing was Rozemyne’s attempt to contact me. If it weren’t for her guard knight, we still wouldn’t know anything.”</p><p>With a weary sigh, my wife said, “So she has the book.”</p><p>Ferdinand’s face went blank as Aub Ehrenfest’s paled. Sieglinde met their gaze with a bitter smirk. “The only reason the royal family would take such drastic and secretive action would be if the Grutrissheit was involved. If one of them already knows how to obtain it, then they needn’t risk angering you, who has strong ties to us, by questioning her. They would only do this if she already had it. Now, which one is holding her?”</p><p>Ferdinand’s jaw tightened, and Aub Ehrenfest answered for him, “Prince Sigiswald.”</p><p>I felt the color drain from my face as Sieglinde’s expression darkened. Prince Sigiswald had finally gone too far, his descent into madness complete. He’d slowly been taking more and more drastic attempts to secure his spot as heir. Attempting to sabotage Prince Anastasius’s wooing of Princess Eglantine was just the beginning. Just recently, he’d sent someone to attack Prince Hildebrand, and that was after he started trying to poison the boy’s food, though Magdalena had yet to find any proof of his involvement. It was becoming so bad that even Prince Anastasius started bringing the young boy to his villa for tutoring to protect him from Prince Sigiswald.</p><p>And now the man had stooped to capturing archduke candidates and holding them prisoner. If he really thought Rozemyne had the Grutrissheit, he would probably force her into his bed - underaged or not - so she would have no choice but to marry him. He could then use her like a magic tool, taking her out of her gilded cage whenever he needed to use the book and then stuffing her back inside when he was done.</p><p>Fortunately for her, Rozemyne’s fiancé was a little too blessed by Ewigeliebe, and he’d given her plenty of magically-enhanced ice. She probably had a dozen charms hidden on her person in addition to her over-the-top necklace and extravagant hairstick. Just the two visible charms had nasty protective magic circles in them, so I could only imagine what the hidden ones did. If Sigiswald so much as looked at her wrong, he’d touch the towering stairway.</p><p>Of course, whether he touched her or not, the prince would soon be greeting the Supreme Couple if we didn’t keep our favorite Ewigeliebe from sinking his sword into his chest.</p><p>Sieglinde clicked her tongue. “Of course it is. You need to file an official complaint to the zent.”</p><p>With a shake of his head, Aub Ehrenfest said, “You heard his response when I came over here. He’s putting me off until tomorrow.”</p><p>I could understand that if the request for an audience had come from a low-ranking duchy, but this was the Sixth. How could he put off a top-ranking duchy when they needed to file a complaint?</p><p><em>Oh, wait. They were neutral in the war.</em> Regardless of their performance or contributions to the country, they’d never wash away that stain.</p><p>“Let’s see what he has to say to me,” I growled as I pulled out an ordonnanz. “Zent Trauerqual, this Aub Dunkelfelger. I need to file an official complaint.”</p><p>He responded that he’d hear it in the morning. I sent back, “This is urgent. Prince Sigiswald has kidnapped Lady Rozemyne of Ehrenfest and placed her in schtappe-sealing cuffs without contacting her aub.”</p><p>“We will investigate immediately,” the reply said.</p><p>As time passed while we waited, Ferdinand became more and more tense, eventually closing his eyes and lowering his head to hide his expression. Sieglinde and I could both tell he was a breath away from snapping.</p><p>It was then that I received another ordonnanz from one of the zent’s aides. “We are unable to establish contact with Prince Sigiswald.”</p><p>Ferdinand’s head snapped up at that, and he sent an ordonnanz to Rozemyne saying, “Rozemyne, fear not. I am coming for you.”</p><p>It didn’t fly.</p><p>There were only three reasons an ordonnanz would fail. Either Prince Sigiswald had taken her from the Academy, they were both in a hidden room, or they had climbed the towering staircase.</p><p>No matter which one it was, we were about to have a bloodbath on our hands.</p><p>For the briefest moment, his eyes swam in a rainbow of colors before he closed them and stuffed a hand into one of the pouches on his belt. When he removed it, his fingertips shimmered with specks of gold powder. He still kept his eyes closed as he said, “He has her in his hidden room.” It seemed of the three, that was the explanation he could accept the most.</p><p>Sieglinde and I both knew we’d need to make a move if we wanted to avoid the impending massacre. As terrible as the situation was, my heart still soared when I saw her retrieve some parchment, a pen, and ink. Finally! My ditter with the Lord of Evil was upon us! “I’ll draw up the ditter contract,” she announced. “At least if we win, we’d have a couple of years to prepare before the Grutrissheit gets involved…”</p><p>The lightning was back, coursing through my veins and tickling my skin. What a game this would be! It would be recorded in the history books so future aubs could weep bitter tears as they read about such a magnificent ditter they would never witness. The stakes could not be higher! They–</p><p>My blood ran cold. It finally hit me that at the end of this, I could very well become zent.</p><p>As my wife began writing out the contract, she said, “This will be pointless, of course, if we cannot obtain her signature for the adoption.”</p><p>Ferdinand assured us that he could, though I couldn’t imagine how with her trapped with Prince Sigiswald in his hidden room. Then again, this was the Lord of Evil. Who knew what nefarious tricks he could pull to get a piece of parchment past an impenetrable barrier?</p><p>Once Sieglinde finished writing the contract, Ferdinand, Aub Ehrenfest, and I signed it. We agreed to meet on the ditter field in half a bell. The two of them then rushed out of our tea party room to go prepare.</p><p>Sieglinde took down the sound barrier, and I summoned Heisshitze and Rarstark. “Knights, we’re having a 3-on-3 ditter with the Lord of Evil in half a bell. Can I count on your support?”</p><p>“Yes, Aub!” they both shouted, overflowing with the excitement that was quickly reawakening in me.</p><p>I pushed the possibility of losing far from my mind so I could enjoy this historic ditter to its fullest. A grin spread across my face in anticipation of the devious ploys these stakes would inspire the Lord of Evil to visit upon us on the ditter field.</p><p> </p><p>Nearly all of my people still at the Academy came to spectate. They crowded the edge of our sitting area as all of them vied for a spot up front. Ehrenfest, however, only had a handful of spectators, just Aub Ehrenfest, his wife, and their retainers. Lady Florencia held no excitement as she sat placidly in Ehrenfest’s spot, but I could see how tense Aub Ehrenfest’s shoulders were even from where I stood in the center of the field. It seemed they hadn’t told her what this ditter was about.</p><p>When our three opponents landed on the field, I couldn’t hide my wide grin. I went over to greet them. “FERDINAND! You brought Wilfried! Excellent! Most excellent! To share such a historic ditter with my son-in-law moves me deeply! Come, we will engage in a most gratifying ditter! I have wanted to face you on the field for quite some time now, and I will let neither Wilfried’s presence nor Heisshitze’s fervor rob me of this chance!”</p><p>I looked over the three of them. Ferdinand stood with his arms crossed, his face stony. The pouch on his belt bulged, likely filled to the brim with magic tools. That was what I liked about him - he was always ready for a ditter.</p><p>Wilfried had a determined look on his face, his eyes blazing with the desire to win. While he had plenty of potions on his belt, he didn’t seem to be carrying many magic tools, if any. Of course, they could have been hidden to give the impression his bite would have fewer teeth. He was trained by the Lord of Evil himself, after all.</p><p>Behind them was Ferdinand’s guard knight, Eckhart. They had been in the Academy at the same time, meaning he had real experience with treasure-stealing ditter, not just these little skirmishes we’d been having. He’d fought well during the welcoming ditter, enough to easily match either of my knights.</p><p>This would indeed be a most excellent ditter! Ferdinand would try to end it as soon as possible. Ordinarily, I would try to drag it out a little to fully enjoy this rare chance, but I would earn my victory as swift as Steifebrise this time. I didn’t want that poor excuse for a prince to hold Rozemyne a moment longer than necessary.</p><p>“We’ll strategize near our base until the ditter bell rings,” Ferdinand said.</p><p>“Oh, but the bell has already rung, has it not? I believe Prince Sigiswald rang it himself,” I said with a grin before turning to meet with my own team.</p><p>“This will be a ditter that will decide the course of history for our duchy, possibly our entire country,” I said to Heisshitze and Rarstark. “We cannot afford to lose. Do you have your masks to protect from their paralyzing poison?”</p><p>“Yes, Aub!” they replied.</p><p>“Good. Now, this is the plan. You two will go to collect our treasure. You have the sleeping powder, right?”</p><p>Rarstark nodded.</p><p>“Good,” I said. “You’ll use that so that even if you get trapped inside a shield with the feybeast, it won’t attack you. Heisshitz, you have the most experience fighting Ferdinand, so you’ll be with me. Rarstark, you will guard the treasure. They will probably use Wilfried as a guard since he can make the shield. That means Eckhart will be on the field. His performance at the welcoming ditter suggests he would pose a challenge to either of you, so do not underestimate him. There’s no telling what tools he’s been given.</p><p>“Heisshitz, keep Ferdinand busy again. Only I have enough mana to overwhelm Wilfried’s shield, so leave Rarstark unguarded to lure Eckhart down field to keep him out of my way.”</p><p>They nodded their understanding, and I went to the center to wait for Ferdinand. Soon enough, we’d had our opening exchanges, and the bell rang.</p><p>As predicted, Wilfried had gone to secure their treasure. Oddly enough, Eckhart didn’t join him. He instead waited in the air roughly where one would expect Wilfried to reappear. Ferdinand merely stood where he was, not even summoning his highbeast. Was he trying to conserve mana?</p><p>
<em>No. This is a tactic meant to unnerve me, but I shall not fall for it! It will take more than an icy stare to shake my resolve!</em>
</p><p>In no time at all, Wilfried crested the wall with a zantze struggling in his net. He sped towards their base, the yellow shield going up as soon as he touched down. I was surprised he was able to raise it so quickly, but then I realized he’d just started reciting the prayer while he was still in the air.</p><p>All three of my opponents slipped on their masks, and I smirked. After I pulled mine on, I sent an ordonnanz to my men to put theirs on as well.</p><p>“HA!” I laughed. “Your poison will not work on us today, Lord of Evil!”</p><p>Ferdinand seemed nonplussed by his plan being foiled, meaning the poison had only been a secondary tactic. Or perhaps it was a taunt meant to test our determination. Or maybe he had developed a poison that only needed to touch the skin, and he was giving us a false sense of security so we wouldn’t attempt to defend ourselves from it.</p><p>Such dastardly plots! Just as I would expect from the Lord of Evil!</p><p>Strangely, they didn’t make a move against me once they obtained their treasure, despite the odds being in their favor. Instead, they just…sat there. Eckhart hadn’t moved even after Wilfried returned. I couldn’t fathom what they were up to.</p><p>When my men crested the wall with their large feybeast, Eckhart barreled towards them, crashing into Heisshitze. Rarstark rightly prioritized getting to the base, leaving them behind.</p><p>That was when Ferdinand made his move. He aimed his strange, one-handed weapon at me and loosed one of his loaded arrows. Rozemyne’s situation must have really rattled him because his shot went wide. I laughed to myself as I waited for Rarstark to get to the base so I could properly retaliate.</p><p>A second shot exploded against my breastplate, enveloping me in a cloud of powder. I immediately leapt out of the cloud and waschened myself just in case my earlier guess about contact poisons had been correct.</p><p>When the water vanished, I was faced with yet another poison cloud right where Ferdinand had been standing. Had he…had he shot poison at <em>himself</em>?</p><p>The trail of smoke indicated he’d run out of the cloud towards me, but I didn’t see him anywhere. As my eyes darted around the field, movement caught my eye. When I followed it, I realized it was a thrown spear just as it buried itself in our feybeast. A second and third followed suit immediately after, each flying from the cloud of powder from the shot Ferdinand had “missed” at the beginning. The third one did the trick. It toppled to the ground, its tip piercing the blue feystone.</p><p>“What the–?!” Rarstark bellowed as he felt the weight of his treasure vanish. “Wait! <em>WHAT?!</em>”</p><p>I echoed his sentiments. This wasn’t the kind of dastardly plot I wanted from the Lord of Evil! I hadn’t even gotten a single blow in!</p><p>As Sieglinde called Ehrenfest’s victory, I wondered how Ferdinand had gotten to the other end of the field without me noticing him. I’d only lost sight of him for the span of a breath. Surely he couldn’t move faster than my enhanced vision could see.</p><p>Heisshitze and Rarstark joined me as Ehrenfest reconvened to discuss their victory. I asked my men, “Did you see him?”</p><p>They both shook their heads. “I saw him loose one of those loaded arrows at his feet, and then I saw the smoke move when he left it, but I never saw him. It was like he was invisible. How can a man move so fast that he can’t be seen at all?”</p><p>“That’s what I would like to know,” I muttered. If he could truly move at such speed, I wanted to know how he achieved it. If he had found a way to make himself invisible, however… That could be dangerous in the wrong hands.</p><p>It struck me then that I might have to address this issue as Zent.</p><p>My expression must have changed because both of the knights started apologizing for our defeat.</p><p>“How will our duchy change now?” Heisshitze asked, his face pale.</p><p>“You’ll find out soon enough,” I said. “Perhaps it will be a boon for us.”</p><p>He looked away and muttered in a bitter tone, “Surely not as much of a boon as getting both the Lord and Saint of Evil.”</p><p>I wasn’t sure how obtaining the Grutrissheit or possibly becoming zent stacked against gaining two of the finest strategists of their generations, but I would regrettably find out soon enough.</p><p>I took a deep breath and reminded myself that we were only getting the Grutrissheit to use as leverage. It didn’t necessarily mean I would become zent. In the glorious histories of Dunkelfelger kept in the aub’s hidden library, my predecessors from long ago said all aubs used to obtain their Wisdom. I was merely following in their mighty footsteps.</p><p><em>That’s right,</em> I told myself. <em>This is just to obtain leverage to free Rozemyne and keep her away from the royal family. Just leverage.</em></p><p>I knew it was a lie, but it still comforted me. After all, if I became zent, who would dare challenge me to ditter?</p><p>On the other hand, though, who would dare refuse <em>my</em> challenge to ditter?</p><p>Getting the Grutrissheit might have been the greatest boon ever. Even though I lost, it suddenly felt like I’d won.</p><p>“I need to give Ferdinand what he won from me,” I said jovially. “Have everyone return to the dormitory and remain there, including yourselves. Tell them it is an order from Aub.”</p><p>They saluted and did as instructed. As they flew over to the spectating Dunkelfelgerians, I saw Sieglinde speaking animatedly to the first wife of Ehrenfest. They hadn’t socialized much outside of the brief visits during the Interduchy Tournament and Archduke Conference, and that had only been in recent years. I’d have to ask what they were talking about when I returned. When they parted ways, those from Ehrenfest returned to their dormitory as well, including Wilfried and Eckhart, though the latter didn’t look happy about it. Before I knew it, only Ferdinand and I remained.</p><p>“I have never heard of such a fast ditter!” I said. “Truly a historic game! Surely no one else has ever claimed such a swift victory!”</p><p>His blank expression didn’t change as he said, “I’m sure others have managed to match or beat the time.” Reaching into his pouch, he pulled out seven vials filled with a dark green substance. He handed six to me and drank the other to show they weren’t poisoned. “They are highly effective rejuvenation potions,” he explained. “You will need them.”</p><p>“Worry not!” I declared. “I have my own!”</p><p>“They will not work fast enough,” he said as he mounted his highbeast.</p><p>I looked down at the potions in surprise. The ones Ehrenfest had made for their Dedication Ritual in the joint research had been reported to be beyond expectations. Even the royal family had been impressed enough to use the recipe. I couldn’t believe these would be more effective than those, but then again, I would have never suspected Ferdinand held the Grutrissheit mere bells ago. What other secrets did he keep under the shroud of Verbergen?</p><p>His cold voice interrupted my thoughts. “Come.” he ordered. “Every moment wasted is another moment Rozemyne remains in that hidden room.”</p><p>We flew from the arena, and then Ferdinand dropped down to just above the trees, his eyes trained on the ground. I followed behind, just managing to keep up with his blistering pace. Before long, we landed before a white building I didn’t recognize. It was nearly impossible to see from above with the snow coverage. Even from the ground, it faded into the frosty background.</p><p>Ferdinand pointed to the building and said, “Place your hand on the door.”</p><p>Realizing that was all the explanation I would receive, I put away my highbeast and did as instructed.</p><p>Suddenly, I found myself inside a shrine. Statues of the gods stood before me. In the center was Leidenschaft, holding his mighty spear. On either side of him were his subordinates, and in front of him was a beautiful blue feystone.</p><p>The urge to dedicate mana to the gods overwhelmed me, so I turned my schtappe into a spear and performed the pre-ditter ritual, giving the gods however much they wanted.</p><p>As my mana drained, the feystone grew until it at last turned into a tablet. On it was inscribed, “Your prayers have reached me, and your worth has been acknowledged. I, Leidenschaft, shall now grant you a word necessary to obtain the Book of Mestionora.” Below that was the word, “Tapferlacht.”</p><p>Just as I began to worry about having to remember seven unfamiliar words, the tablet disappeared, merging with my schtappe and etching the word directly into my mind.</p><p>I blinked, and before me was the white door to the temple. I was back outside.</p><p>I turned to Ferdinand, surprise and confusion muddying my thoughts. “How long was I gone?” I asked.</p><p>“You never left,” he said. “You only just now placed your hand on the door.”</p><p>“So time passes in the shrine but not outside?”</p><p>Ferdinand nodded. “Did you get the tablet?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“How’s your mana?”</p><p>Since I’d hardly used any during the ditter, I was still fine. When I said as much, he replied, “On to the next.”</p><p>As I brought out my highbeast, I looked up and gasped. “That blue light…”</p><p>A tower of blue light was streaming into the air from the top of the shrine. We’d just alerted everyone to our location. Just as I tensed in preparation to defend myself - from what, I wasn’t sure yet - Ferdinand explained, “It indicates you’ve obtained the tablet from that pillar god.”</p><p>That gave me pause. If the Ehrenfest archduke candidates had walked this path, then the light should have already been there, unless it faded with time. “Who can see it?” I asked.</p><p>“Only you. Now, on to the next,” he said, his impatience leaking into his tone.</p><p>We moved to the next shrine, and inside I found the God of Darkness. There was a small feystone here, too, in his divine color. When I offered my mana this time, he bade me speak the name he’d given to me. I did, and once again, the tablet merged with my schtappe.</p><p>When I returned to myself, I looked at Ferdinand and said, “So only archduke candidates can get the Grutrissheit.”</p><p>He nodded and then took to the air again.</p><p>The Lord of Evil sure was a stoic one. Then again, his thoughts were probably consumed with what was happening to his fiancée at that very moment. That wouldn’t leave a lot of room for pleasant conversation.</p><p>We visited Schutzaria’s shrine next, and just before the feystone filled enough to form the tablet, I paused and took one of Ferdinand’s potions. It wasn’t bad at all. In fact, it tasted mildly of rohres. I soon forgot about the flavor, however, as I felt my mana return in a rush. Never had I come across a potion so effective before. In four years when the ban on challenging anyone from Ehrenfest was finally lifted, I would ditter Ferdinand for the recipe!</p><p>When we approached the next shrine, Ferdinand explained, “This shrine houses both Ewigeliebe and Geduldh. Do <em>not</em> approach Geduldh. You must pray to receive her tablet. Understand?”</p><p>I snorted. Whoever made these shrines valued accuracy to the tales of the gods.</p><p>When I entered, I found Ewigeliebe and his subordinates guarding a smaller shrine. This time, there was no feystone waiting for me. Performing the spear dance drained a stagger amount of mana from me, but when the tablet was formed, Ewigeliebe permitted me to pray to Geduldh. The small shrine opened to reveal a statue of his wife, waiting alone in captivity for her sister to wash her husband away and free her from her prison.</p><p>After I received Geduldh’s tablet and found myself back outside, I looked down at myself in wonder. My schtappe was growing.</p><p>Of course, Ferdinand didn’t allow me the time to process this new information. I had to drink a potion before I visited the Goddess of Light’s shrine, but thanks to the small golden feystone that waited for me, I didn’t have to take another to fill Flutrane’s tablet. The quality of my schtappe improved with each tablet.</p><p>When I left Flutrane’s shrine, I looked up and staggered back. The lights from the shrines formed an enormous magic circle that pulsed with mana.</p><p>“The three Dedication Rituals performed for joint research this year saved you some mana,” Ferdinand said. “That’s just as well since you’re supposed to offer prayers in the chapel to fill the circle, which we can’t access without royalty.”</p><p>He turned to me and said, “You now have to go to the statue of Mestionora on the second floor of the library and give mana to the Grutrissheit she holds. When you receive your Wisdom, you do not have to take it in all at once. You may return as many times as it takes to complete it. You’ll still be able to use it even when it's incomplete.</p><p>“And one more thing. Beseech Dregarnuhr to return you in a timely manner. If you exit through the door, you will appear in the Farthest Hall, which you won’t be able to leave without royal intervention. You can instead ask to be returned to the library, or if that fails, fly out through the top.”</p><p>I narrowed my eyes at him, his explanation leaving me with more confusion than understanding. “The top of what?”</p><p>“You must go to the library,” he said, ignoring my question. “Contact me when you return.”</p><p>
<em>Hmm… He’s a lot more fun on the ditter field.</em>
</p><p>I mounted my highbeast and flew towards the library as Ferdinand headed back for Ehrenfest’s dorms. I wasn’t sure if they would allow me entry after hours, but I was prepared to throw my weight around if necessary. This was to fulfill the stakes of ditter, after all!</p><p>Of course, that wouldn’t work if Princess Adolphine was the one I had to deal with, but someone of her status wouldn’t be answering a door so late in the evening.</p><p>Thankfully, Professor Solange was the one who answered my knock. The other librarians would have surely given me some trouble, despite only being archnobles.</p><p>“Oh my,” she said when she saw me. “What brings you to the library this evening, Aub Dunkelfelger?”</p><p>“I know this is highly irregular, but I need access to the library,” I said, looking down at her while I used my intimidating height to its fullest. “There is something I absolutely must check.”</p><p>“Oh, let me go get one of the other librarians then and–”</p><p>“Professor Solange, it’s an emergency,” I said. “I must go right now.”</p><p>Her eyes wavered for a moment before she slowly opened the door to allow me entry. “What is it you’re looking for?” she asked. “Perhaps I can help you find it?”</p><p>“No need,” I replied as I strode across the reading room. “I know where it is. You can remain here.”</p><p>I went to the second floor and found the statue of Mestionora. It took a great deal of mana to fill the Grutrissheit, forcing me to take yet another potion. I was getting close to potion toxicity, so if I had to give much more mana, we were going to be in some trouble. A magic circle and spell appeared in my mind, and then I was suddenly in a dark room.</p><p>All this vanishing and reappearing places was getting old.</p><p>Right before I took a step forward to feeling out my surroundings, light flashed at my feet and spread outward, illuminating the entire room.</p><p>On the wall was a breath-taking mural depicting me, my son, my daughter, my first wife, and several knights on highbeast, engaged in a friendly bout of ditter. I’d never played with Sieglinde, but I had always wanted to. Were the gods telling me that she would join me on the field one day? Or were they teasing me by dangling my deepest desires before my eyes?</p><p>A golden shumil appeared then and asked, “Art thou the one who seekest knowledge?”</p><p>This felt like my last chance to back out, and I was momentarily tempted. I didn’t want to be zent, but once it came to light that I had Wisdom, that would be that.</p><p>If I were placed on the throne, who would my successor even be? Lestilaut would be Aub Dunkelfelger. Hannelore was marrying into Ehrenfest. Raufreg was too single-minded for the role. I would likely have to adopt another child.</p><p>It was a shame Rozemyne wasn’t on the table anymore now that I’d lost. She would make a good zent with Ferdinand by her side, and he would avoid having to rule.</p><p>These were problems that could wait for another day. For now, I had some ditter winnings to deliver.</p><p>“Yes,” I answered the shumil.</p><p>“Then follow,” it replied. “Thou who seekest knowledge.”</p><p>It led me to a spiral staircase, and I followed after it as it hopped down. The shumil took me to a door decorated with seven feystones in the colors of the Divine Couple and Eternal Five.</p><p>“Touch the door,” it said. “If you are qualified, it will open.”</p><p>A small part of me hoped I wouldn’t be worthy as I placed my hand upon it. The feystones each lit in turn before the door opened, revealing a colorful barrier that blocked my view beyond.</p><p>“Thou seeker of knowledge, who hast been recognized by the gods,” the shumil said, “Go forth. That which thou seekest lies beyond.”</p><p>I passed through the barrier and found myself on a glowing white path. At the end of it was an ivory staircase, which I ascended only to come to the tree where I had obtained my schtappe. “So it all comes full circle,” I laughed as I approached the tree.</p><p>
<em>Finally, he sent me a proper candidate.</em>
</p><p>I froze at the voice, wondering if the gods had just spoken to me.</p><p>The grand tree began to morph, taking the shape of a man made of ivory.</p><p><em>Am…am I standing in the presence of a god?!</em> I wondered. I didn’t recognize him, but I wasn’t the most devout of people, either.</p><p>The ivory man kept his eyes shut as he spoke to me. It was unnerving. “You have come to receive your Wisdom and take your rightful place as zent.”</p><p>“Rightful place?” I repeated as Schneerhst sent a shiver through me.</p><p>
<em>Did I just receive a divine directive to take the throne? Did the gods who weave fate already have a pattern selected for me?</em>
</p><p>“You must hurry to dye the foundation,” he continued. “Only a thin layer of mana covers Yurgenschmidt. It will crumble to white sand soon if nothing is done.”</p><p>My jaw dropped. Even after all those Dedication Rituals, the country was in danger of collapsing? Just how much mana would it take? Would my wives and children even be enough to keep it filled?</p><p>“Hurry and take out your schtappe,” the ivory man commanded me. “Prayers must be offered.”</p><p>As soon as I took it out, the seven divine colors flashed from its tip in turn, producing the tablets I’d just received. They each came before me, and the words I’d been given came from my mouth unbidden. It was a terrifying experience, my body being controlled by another, even if it was the gods.</p><p>The man then ordered me to pray to the Seven and ask for Mestionora’s Wisdom. I did as commanded, and the lights surrounding me shot into the sky, beckoning another light to shine down on me.</p><p>Knowledge started flooding me, and I learned I was kneeling before Ewaermen, a former god who’d abandoned his divinity after his mistake led Geduldh to her yearly suffering.</p><p>As information flew through me, I caught tidbits I wanted to know more about, but Ewaermen rebuked me. “Do not think,” he ordered. “Simply accept it.”</p><p>Easier said than done. When information from the zent from Dunkelfelger hit me, I couldn’t help but chase after it until Ewaermen admonished me again.</p><p>Eventually, I couldn’t take it anymore, and I cried out, “Stop!”</p><p>“No, accept it all,” Ewaermen barked. “Do not spill any. This is necessary to save Yurgenschmidt. I will not allow a real candidate to leave here with an incomplete book again. It took too long for that rude man to return and finish his Wisdom.”</p><p>Ferdinand had lied to me!</p><p>Then again, I could well imagine he was the rude man who’d forced even a former god to change his tactics.</p><p>As expected of the Lord of Evil!</p><p>When knowledge of what the royal family had done - establishing themselves as the sole rulers of Yurgenschmidt, losing the true way to Wisdom, making magic tool versions of the Grutrissheit, locking them behind barriers only they could cross - I nearly lost it and had to be corrected by the former god twice before I could start accepting the knowledge again.</p><p>If Ferdinand truly had his Wisdom and saw this, then it was no wonder he didn’t push Princess Eglantine to obtain hers like he did me.</p><p>To think everything we believed had been a deception!</p><p>When the light finally faded, I fell over but managed to catch myself before I hit the ground.</p><p>“Good. You may rest.”</p><p>“No,” I said, taking out my final potion. He’d given me the exact amount I would need. I would expect nothing less from the Lord of Evil. “I don’t have time to rest. I must return as soon as possible. Please, ask Dregarnuhr to return me to the moment after I left.”</p><p>Ewaermen frowned. “I see that rude man has influenced you.” He turned his face upward and then nodded. “Very well. She will grant this request. Hurry. Go forth and save the garden.”</p><p>“Yes, Ewaermen.” Knowing that the country was a giant magic circle that kept Ewigeliebe contained, I could understand the urgency. We would all die if he escaped.</p><p>As the former god began morphing back into a tree, light surrounded me, and before I knew it, I was standing in front of the statue of Mestionora. I wasn’t sure how long I was gone. It felt like an eternity. When I walked down the stairs, however, I found Professor Solange waiting for me.</p><p>“My, that was fast,” she said. “Were you able to find what you were looking for? Oh, you’re quite pale. Are you alright?”</p><p>“Yes. Thank you, Professor Solange. I will take my leave.”</p><p>As I entered the hall, I pulled out an ordonnanz. “Ferdinand, I’m ready. Let’s meet in Ehrenfest’s tea party room.”</p><p>He sent back an acknowledgement, and when I arrived, Ferdinand and Aub Ehrenfest greeted me before they activated a sound-blocking tool.</p><p>“So you have it?” Ferdinand asked.</p><p>I held my hand out and said, “Grutrissheit.” The Book of Mestionora appeared.</p><p>It was…heavier than I expected.</p><p>In my hand was proof of my right to take the throne and the damning evidence that would oust the current “royal family.” I swore to myself at that moment to set things right and destroy the foul work of the unworthy zents of old. How dare they trample on our marvelous history!</p><p>“I’ll start dyeing the foundation once the one in Dunkelfelger is no longer mine. For now, this will be enough.”</p><p>Ferdinand merely nodded at my firm resolve before asking me to contact the king.</p><p>“This is Aub Dunkelfelger,” I said to the white bird on my arm. “I have obtained my Wisdom, and I am going to Prince Sigiswald’s villa. I will retrieve Lady Rozemyne, and we will discuss your son’s punishment.”</p><p>The response came as I was stepping out of the tea room, Ferdinand and his guard knight close behind. “I will meet you there.”</p><p>Ferdinand sent a message to Rozemyne’s guard knight who had come to inform us she’d been taken captive. Once it flew off, we dashed down the halls towards the entrance to Sigiswald’s villa. Surprisingly, the purple-haired knight caught up to us before we reached our destination.</p><p>Were all of Ehrenfest’s knights blessed by Steifebrise?</p><p>We arrived at the same time as King Trauerqual. When his eyes landed on me, he came forward and knelt, causing a stir among his retinue. “Your Majesty!” one of them cried. “He is not yet zent! You don’t have to–”</p><p>“Silence,” he commanded. He then looked up at me and said, “Allow me this last act - to assist in apprehending my son who erred so grievously against you and Ehrenfest.”</p><p>My mouth pulled into a tight line. I’d been avoiding thinking about it, but I would have to execute my sister’s husband along with Anastasius. She, at least, would be saved since she wasn’t related to Sigiswald, though she would hate me for it.</p><p>“Very well,” I said.</p><p>Ferdinand nodded to Eckhart who stepped forward and poison checked the door. The moment he gave the all clear, Ferdinand slipped around everyone and burst into the room, his strange weapon held at the ready.</p><p>We followed after. The front of the villa was empty of people, which sent a chill down my spine. I didn’t have much time to investigate, however, as the sound of fighting echoed from upstairs. Ferdinand, Eckhart, the purple-haired knight, and I rushed up the stairs.</p><p>“WASCHEN!”</p><p>At the end of the hall stood the second prince with three of his guard knights flanking him. His schtappe was pointed at the master bedroom, which was filled floor to ceiling with turbulent water. Sounds of a continued struggle came from the large sitting rooms to the right and left.</p><p>Anastasius turned to us and barked, “Help capture the traitors!” He indicated the rooms to either side and then turned just as the water disappeared. Ferdinand rushed forward with the prince into Sigiswald’s bedroom while I took the room on the left and Eckhart and the purple-haired knight took the right.</p><p>Inside I found two of Rozemyne’s apprentice knights, four of her attendants, and four of Anastasius’s guard knights fighting off ten Sovereign knights. Six pairs of schtappe-sealing cuffs were on the floor behind them.</p><p>Rozemyne’s two knights, a young boy with brown hair and a girl with orange hair, fought defensively, only raising their weapons to block attacks. The attendants were throwing weak ditter tools only meant to slow or annoy opponents at the knights pursuing them.</p><p>Anastasius’s knights, however, had no aversion to attacking. They fought to kill. Even as I entered the room, one of Sigiswald’s knights fell as he climbed the towering stairway.</p><p>With a roar, I joined the fray, slamming into the two knights going after the attendants. One of them stumbled, and I kicked him over. The moment his shield was out of the way, Brunhilde, the woman who would be Wilfried’s second wife, bound him in bands of light. I expected him to break free, and he certainly tried hard enough, but it was as if he were pushing against bands of hardened steel.</p><p>Just what were they feeding those kids in Ehrenfest?!</p><p>I bound the second one myself and went to help the boy with brown hair. He managed to keep standing under the assault of a Sovereign knight, though he was only a few hits away from his breaking point. I stepped in and slashed at the knight, gouging his arm. As he cried out in pain, I kicked his feet out from under him and slammed my knee against his face as he fell. Brunhilde caught him in bands of light as well.</p><p>One of Anastasius’s knights had gotten to the one attacking the girl with orange hair before I could. Of our ten opponents, four were bound and six had been sent to the distant heights.</p><p>Rozemyne’s guard knights and attendants followed after me as I left, heading to the bedroom as I moved to the other sitting area. I found one of Anastasius’s knights binding their last opponent, the fight already concluded. Only three of Rozemyne’s retainers had been kept here - an apprentice knight with green hair and two apprentice scholars. The apprentice knight had done an admirable job of protecting the scholars. While he was a bit worse for wear, they didn’t have a single wound.</p><p>“You,” I said, pointing to the purple-haired boy. “Go downstairs and let the king know we’ve cleared most of the floor and that we’re about to infiltrate Prince Sigiswald’s bedroom. It should be safe for him to come up after that.”</p><p>The young man looked towards the bedroom but went to do as he was told.</p><p>“<em>Give me the stone!</em>”</p><p>Eckart bolted for the sitting room when he heard his master’s resounding command. I dashed down the hall and found the bedroom full of post-battle chaos. Two men lay motionless on the ground while another two sat quietly in their bands of light, their faces full of confused terror. At Anastasius’s feet lay another knight bound with light, though this one was grievously wounded. He wouldn’t die from the injuries, but he probably wished he would.</p><p>Ferdinand was holding his hand out to the second prince, who held a multicolor feystone out of his reach.</p><p>His eyes glistening with unshed tears, he barked, “You can’t have my brother’s feystone!”</p><p>I and all the retainers froze, our eyes going to the stone in his hand.</p><p><em>Please, please, tell me Ferdinand didn’t kill the first prince!</em> I begged the gods.</p><p>“Then hurry and open the door to his hidden room!” Ferdinand yelled.</p><p>“Why?!”</p><p>“<em>Rozemyne is inside!</em> Who knows if another of Prince Sigiswald’s guard knights is in there with her?!”</p><p>Anastasius sharply inhaled as his eyes widened in shock. He recovered a moment later and rushed over to the door, pressing the stone against it.</p><p>It opened, and Rozemyne leapt into the doorway, brandishing her flower hair pin in one hand and holding the feystone-laden one like a dagger in the other. Some of her loose hair fell over her face, making her look disheveled in a way that made my stomach clench with dread. When she saw us, she lunged forward but bounced off an invisible barrier.</p><p>“They adjusted the parameters for the hidden room,” I growled. Those cuffs on her wrists likely dropped her mana to mednoble level, and anyone below archnoble wouldn’t be able to exit the room.</p><p>Ferdinand met with the same barrier, meaning it was even more specific than I’d thought. I didn’t bother to guess what the new parameters were. It didn’t matter because Anastasius placed Sigiswald’s feystone against the hidden room’s registration stone and changed its requirements.</p><p>Rozemyne burst from the room, her arms reaching for Ferdinand. Throwing convention to the wind, he gathered his fiancée in a tight embrace. Everyone immediately turned away from them to afford them some privacy. One of Anastasius’s knights muttered, “Really?” under his breath. I couldn’t fault them for their open display of affection, though. I would have done the same had Sieglinde been trapped inside.</p><p>I moved past the embarrassed men and glared down at the prisoner Anastasius had been guarding. He was thrashing about the best he could despite his injuries and gnashing at the gag in his mouth. “Is this the leader?”</p><p>Anastasius joined me, seeming glad of the distraction. “Yes, he was the one holding Sigi–” His voice cracked, and he took a moment to gather himself. “–holding Sigiswald’s feystone.”</p><p>If I had been an archduke candidate from Ehrenfest, the room would have been flooded with blessings. Ferdinand hadn’t killed the first prince! Praise be to the gods!</p><p>My exhilaration quickly died, however. Just because Ferdinand didn’t do it didn’t mean Ehrenfest couldn’t still be implicated. If someone’s charge was wrongfully put in schtappe-sealing cuffs, a guard knight would naturally take action. One of her apprentice knights might have been the one to send Sigiswald to the distant heights.</p><p>The purple-haired knight ran in then, and when he saw Rozemyne, he joined her and her other guard knights. Dropping to a knee, he started giving apologies for being unable to protect her. As she was bidding him to stand, King Trauerqual and a handful of his guard knights entered the room while the rest took up posts outside. Everyone knelt, myself included. It wasn’t the appropriate time to reveal I had my Wisdom, so I had to continue to play along.</p><p>As soon as he saw me take a knee, Trauerqual ordered everyone to stand and looked around the room. “I see Lady Rozemyne has been found. What of Sigiswald?”</p><p>Everyone grew quiet as the air thickened with dread. After taking a moment to compose himself, Anastasius stepped forward and held out the feystone.</p><p>Trauerqual’s eyes widened in disbelief as he reached out and touched it. “Are you sure it’s his?”</p><p>“It opened his hidden room.”</p><p>The king closed his eyes and lowered his head, trying to contain his emotions. Eventually, he got control of himself and cast his weighty gaze down on the wounded captive. “Why is he gagged?”</p><p>“Because he was spewing nonsense, and I didn’t want to hear it,” Anastasius said.</p><p>“What sort of nonsense?”</p><p>He glanced around the room before he covered his mouth and handed his father a sound blocking tool. The king’s eyes widened at what his son said, and he glanced at me, all but confirming the prisoner had been blathering about Rozemyne and the Grutrissheit.</p><p>I sighed and ran a hand over my hair, cataloging all the insanity before me. We had a kidnapped archduke candidate held in a hidden room she couldn’t escape from, retainers held captive in separate rooms, a dead prince who kidnapped the archduke candidate, the prince’s guard knight who talked about a connection between the archduke candidate and the missing Grutrissheit, and of course, an aub holding the missing Grutrissheit.</p><p>
<em>What a mess…</em>
</p><p>
<em>Well, first thing’s first. Let’s figure out how Sigiswald died.</em>
</p><p>I looked over my shoulder at our resident Ewigeliebe and Geduldh. They had thankfully parted, and someone had put Rozemyne’s hairsticks back in place. The couple was now engaged in a conversation hidden behind sound blockers as Ferdinand appeared to give her a medical exam. Rozemyne’s face was distraught, but Ferdinand’s was as blank as ever. Now that his fiancée was safe, it seemed he was able to get his emotions under control.</p><p>Anastasius apparently had the same idea as he spun around and called out, “Rozemyne, come here.”</p><p>After exchanging a look with Ferdinand, she gave him back the sound-blocking tool and walked towards us, her usual smooth glide a bit wobbly. She knelt before the king and addressed the prince. “How may I be of assistance to you, Your Highness?”</p><p>He bade her stand and passed her and King Trauerqual a sound-blocking tool. After the king said something to him, he gave one to me as well.</p><p>“Rozemyne, what did Sigiswald say to you when you were brought to his villa?” Anastasius asked, emotion causing his voice to tremble somewhat.</p><p>She shook her head. “My deepest apologies, but I never saw him.”</p><p>The three of us stared at her in disbelief. “What do you mean you never saw him?” Anastasius demanded.</p><p>She looked down as she told us what happened. “I was on my way back to the dorms from the library when knights from the Sovereignty approached me. They said I had received a royal summons and that all of my retainers were to come with me.”</p><p>“Hold on,” I said. “How did your guard knight manage to reach us, then?”</p><p>“He’s very, very good at slipping away unnoticed,” she said. “It’s one of the reasons I chose him to serve me.”</p><p>I furrowed my brow, wondering if that talent was connected to how Ferdinand had seemingly disappeared on the ditter field.</p><p>“I was brought here and told I was going to be questioned by Prince Sigiswald. I said I needed to contact my guardians then, and they put me in those cuffs. When my guard knights moved to protect me, I ordered them to stand down.” She paused and pulled her lips into a tight line. “I didn’t want to cause an incident, and I was certain this was all a misunderstanding.</p><p>“The knights made me go upstairs and…” Her voice leveled out as her expression became cold. She looked down at the injured captive and said, “That man brought me to the hidden room and opened it with a feystone. When I tried to leave, I was stopped by the barrier.”</p><p>Prince Anastasius furrowed his brow. “And you were trapped in there until I opened the door?”</p><p>She nodded. “I thought I was never going to get out.” Under her breath, she muttered, “There wasn’t even anything to read.”</p><p>Anastasius frowned down at her and asked, “Then why did you wait so long to send me that blessing?”</p><p>“What blessing?” I asked.</p><p>He sighed and said in an exasperated tone, “I was getting ready for bed when a yellow blessing started raining down on me. I immediately knew who it’d come from, so I tried to send her an ordonnanz, but it wouldn’t fly. I contacted Aub Ehrenfest to try to figure out what was going on, and that’s when I found out about all this.”</p><p>Turning back to Rozemyne, he asked, “Now, why did you wait so long?”</p><p>Her cheeks colored as she answered, “My deepest apologies for disturbing you. It was not my intention. To be honest, I’m rather surprised it went to you.”</p><p>“Why is that?”</p><p>She hesitated for a moment before answering, “That man had come into the room, and when I wouldn’t answer any of his questions, he tried to attack me, but one of my charms protected me.”</p><p>“That explains the injuries,” I said.</p><p>“That one only injured his arm,” she said. “It was the second and third times he came at me that earned him some of the other injuries.”</p><p>“And the rest?” Anastasius prompted.</p><p>Rozemyne looked away. “My deepest apologies, but I panicked and used my flower hairpin to drive him away from me.”</p><p>I raised my brows as I scrutinized the red flower tucked neatly into her hair. “And just what does that do?”</p><p>“My understanding is that it operates under the same principles as the library shumils. The first touch shocks the offender with a strong, painful jolt. The second pushes them away.”</p><p>I eyed the man who’d finally given up his thrashing. “All that from a push?”</p><p>“It is…a rather strong push.”</p><p>“And you’re walking around with something that dangerous?” Anastasius asked.</p><p>“My deepest apologies for causing you concern. However, it only activates when a man touches it, so under normal circumstances, it would never have the chance to cause any harm.”</p><p>My eyes traveled from the hairpins to the courtship necklace to Ferdinand, who stood close by with his arms crossed and expression hard as ice.</p><p>Anastasius’s eyes widened slightly, also looking at her gifts from Ferdinand. In a hushed voice, he asked, “Rozemyne, do you have reason to fear Ewigeliebe will trap Geduldh in ice before autumn?”</p><p>Her cheeks flushed as she shook her head. “No! I thank you ever so much for your concern, but you needn’t trouble yourself. As I’ve said before, Ferdinand is my Schutzaria, and I have no reason to fear any ice. In fact, he was actually the one who gave it to me.”</p><p>“Of course that Ewigeliebe did,” he muttered. “I suppose his…protectiveness came in handy this time. I agree that the charm, while powerful, does not pose a danger to anyone, save whatever fool dares touch Geduldh. Now, continue your explanation.”</p><p>“Yes, Your Highness.” She paused for a long moment, staring blankly at us, and then her eyes lit with recognition. Had she forgotten what we were talking about? “After I gained some distance between me and the man,” she said, “I prayed to the gods to protect me, but I wasn’t thinking of anyone in particular. The blessing sucked out quite a bit of my remaining mana.”</p><p>Trauerqual rubbed his forehead and said, “And the gods determined Anastasius would be able to offer you protection, thus sending him the blessing.”</p><p>Anastasius shook his head with a sigh. “‘Beloved by the gods’ indeed. Nothing is ever normal with you, is it?” Despite his words, he looked pleased for just a moment before the grief settled back in. He took the sound-blocking tool from her and sent her back to Ferdinand, who immediately gave her another tool and engaged her in conversation again.</p><p>“So Prince Sigiswald had already climbed the towering staircase before she was even summoned,” I said, the tension in my shoulders easing as Sigiswald’s innocence came to light. I wouldn’t have to do collective punishment after all.</p><p>Of course, that still didn’t answer how he had died. Looking down at the injured man, I said, “And here we have someone with all the answers we seek.”</p><p>Trauerqual’s gaze darkened. “If you will allow it, I will retrieve the memory-searching tool.”</p><p>“Father?” Anastasius asked, worry and confusion in his eyes.</p><p>Trauerqual gave him a hard look. “We’ll discuss it later.”</p><p>I nodded to him, and he turned and left with his guard knights. I looked around the room, taking in my surroundings now that most of the chaos had died down. Ferdinand and Rozemyne were still talking under the shroud of Verbergen while their retainers looked on, various expressions of worry and shame on their faces. The two men in the corner still looked befuddled and terrified, and the main perpetrator was suffering silently behind his gag, his tears of pain dripping on the carpet. I told the prince, “Rozemyne and her retainers have been through a lot tonight. Unless you need them for further questioning, I suggest letting them go.” Sending Ferdinand back to Ehrenfest’s dorms would keep him from stabbing any of the men responsible for his fiancée’s suffering, and we needed them alive at least a little longer.</p><p>Anastasius thought for a moment then turned to Ferdinand and Rozemyne. “You may return to your dormitory, but no one is to leave the Royal Academy until I permit it.”</p><p>Ferdinand looked at me, and I nodded. Rather than take her fiancé’s hand to be escorted from the room, Rozemyne approached us instead. Ferdinand looked on with a flat expression, likely brimming with displeasure behind his noble mask. “Prince Anastasius,” she said, allowing herself to show us the heart-rending grief she felt, “I’m so terribly, terribly sorry.”</p><p>Anastasius’s breath hitched as he nodded. “I thank you for your concern.”</p><p>“May I give you a blessing?” she asked. “I’m afraid it’s all I can offer you at the moment.”</p><p>His fists trembled, and he worked to keep his face from showing what he was feeling. “You may.”</p><p>She crossed her hands over her chest and began to intone, “O mighty King and Queen of the endless skies, O mighty Eternal Five who rule the mortal realm, O Goddess of Water Flutrane, O God of Fire Leidenschaft, O Goddess of Wind Schutzaria, O Goddess of Earth Geduldh, O God of Life Ewigeliebe...</p><p>“Please hear my prayer and graciously lend your blessings. I offer you my power and devote to you my service and gratitude. Grant Prince Anastasius protection from those that mean him harm, comfort in his grief, healing for his pain, and endurance for the trials and tribulations he must face.”</p><p>My jaw dropped as mana streamed from Rozemyne’s ring to an all-element blessing that rained over Anastasius. Her blessing at the graduation ceremony last year had been astounding, but this was something else entirely. The ceremony had been a duty. This, however, was born of her earnest wish to ease the prince’s pain after losing his brother. It was beautiful in its complexity and intimacy. I couldn’t describe it if I were asked, but there was just something different about it.</p><p>Anastasius stared up at the blessing, his eyes wide with wonder and brimming with unshed tears. As the light began to fade, he closed his eyes and gathered himself enough to tell her, “Thank you.” We all pretended we didn’t hear his voice crack.</p><p>She kept her gaze on the floor to protect his dignity as she said her goodbyes before she, her likely-livid fiancé, and their retainers left.</p><p>“Go on,” I said. “I’m sure he won’t mind you using it.”</p><p>His face crumpled, and a single wavering sob escaped his throat as he entered Sigiswald’s hidden room and closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>Ferdinand checked to make sure he had enough bullets to make his plan work and that Wilfried and Eckhart had their masks. Only Ferdinand would need one, but ditter was about manipulating the mind of the opponent as much as it was about physically attacking them. Aub Dunkelfelger was no fool, and after the welcoming ditter, all the knights had taken to carrying masks onto the field, at least according to Wilfried. Signaling to the aub, then, that they would be using poison would prompt him to put on his mask. Using poison against him regardless would confuse him for a brief moment.</p><p>And that would be the moment he finished laying his trap. By the time the aub realized what he’d done, he’d be too far down field to guess his whereabouts.</p><p>His hands trembled as he completed his final checks. He tried sending another ordonnanz, but it didn’t fly. The one to Sigiswald didn’t, either.</p><p>Rozemyne was still trapped with that man in his hidden room.</p><p>To avoid thinking about what could be happening to her that very moment, he tried to figure out how Sigiswald even found out about Rozemyne having the Book of Mestionora. It was possible he was working with Eglantine. If she obtained the final tablet but was rejected by the golden shumil, then she could very well decide to sacrifice Rozemyne to the first prince. The foolish man might think it easy enough to compromise her and force her into a marriage to get his hands on her copy of the Book of Mestionora.</p><p>Of course, if he so much as laid a hand on her with ill intent, he’d activate at least one of her charms and likely lose that hand. Ferdinand would dare King Trauerqual to say anything.</p><p>Rozemyne had 42 charms on her, if each feystone counted as a separate charm. 18 activated for physical attacks. 18 activated for magic attacks. 6 would activate for either and refill themselves.</p><p>He was mildly concerned about those six. The schtappe-sealing cuffs greatly limited her mana, and while the charms were designed to ensure they didn’t drain her dry, it could take as little as activating four to drop her to where they would no longer refill.</p><p>Sigiswald would have to survive going through eighteen of the basic charms before the six would come into play. He’d be a feystone before he even made it through half.</p><p>Of course, if he had disposable retainers, he might use them to burn through her defenses.</p><p><em>No, she’ll be fine,</em> he told himself. <em>There aren’t enough fools who would throw away their lives for that coward.</em></p><p>“Ferdinand!” Sylvester called, pulling him from his spiraling thoughts. He walked over, passed him a sound-blocking tool, and said, “You seriously better win. Ehrenfest can’t afford to lose you and Rozemyne, not with Georgine possibly making a move soon.” He paused and then shook his head. “That’s what I should say as aub, but that’s not what I’m actually worried about. I mean, it is, but it’s not as much as–”</p><p>“Get to the point,” Ferdinand growled.</p><p>“Right, right. Look, I don’t want to lose my brother and daughter, alright? So you’d better win! Not that it matters, I guess. Now that Aub Dunkelfelger knows you and Rozemyne have your Wisdom, I don’t see him letting you two rot away in Ehrenfest as a knight commander and minister.”</p><p>Sylvester took a deep breath and continued, “That doesn’t matter right now. Look, regardless of what happens, you’re my brother, and I’ll support you, alright?”</p><p>Ferdinand blinked, and his mind went blank for a moment. Warmth bloomed in his chest and filled his entire body, making even his eyes warm slightly. “I see,” he managed to say. “Thank you.”</p><p>“Aw, don’t give me that look,” Sylvester said with a strained smile. “Now, go stomp Aub Dunkelfelger into the dirt.”</p><p>He nodded, passed back the sound-blocking tool, and then motioned for Wilfried and Eckhart to follow. Sylvester and Florencia were close behind. Ferdinand looked back and saw that while her expression was peaceful as ever, her eyes were sparkling with excitement. It occurred to him that she hadn’t witnessed a treasure-stealing ditter since before the civil war, despite the archducal clan being involved in several in recent years. He was sorry this would be the one she was able to watch, so as consolation, he said to her, “Dunkelfelger has several of the previous ditters recorded. I’m sure Lady Sieglinde would watch them with you over tea.”</p><p>She gave him a bright smile. “Thank you. I may speak with her about it.”</p><p>Ferdinand furrowed his brows slightly in thought as he reworked his impression of his sister-in-law. He knew she hid a fire underneath that peaceful smile, but he never thought she’d held any love for ditter. It was possible she cared more about her son’s participation than anything, but somehow, he didn’t think that was the case.</p><p>When they arrived on the ditter field, Ferdinand looked towards the Academy at the glowing circle hanging in the sky. It seemed that not only did the Dedication Rituals fill the circle but that Wilfried hadn't activated it. So why didn’t the shumils speak to him?</p><p>It didn’t matter. What mattered was saving Rozemyne. He gathered Wilfried and Eckhart and said, “This will be one of the fastest games ever played.”</p><p>After he explained the strategy, Wilfried gave him a bemused smirk. “You’re really going to do it, then? This feels like cheating, but if you’re okay with it…”</p><p>Eckhart crossed his arms and glared down at the boy. “Anything goes in ditter. It’s a fight for survival, not honor.”</p><p>“Believe me, I know,” Wilfried shot back.</p><p>“Enough,” Ferdinand said. “You each understand your roles, yes?”</p><p>They nodded. “Such as they are,” Eckhart said with a shrug.</p><p>“Good. Prepare yourselves.”</p><p>—-----------------------</p><p>After Aub Dunkelfelger obtained the Book of Mestionora, their small group charged into Prince Sigiswald’s villa. Hearing commotion from above, Ferdinand dashed up the stairs and found Anastasius casting a large-scale waschen in the master bedroom. The moment the water vanished, he and the prince ran inside.</p><p>There were five enemies. Two were pushing themselves up, looking around in befuddlement. Two had gotten to their feet and brandished swords. One was heavily injured and making for the door to a hidden room, holding a multicolor feystone out towards it.</p><p>Anastasius knew immediately what the stone was, and he whipped his schtappe at him, catching him in bands of light before he could reach the door and slinging him across the room. The two sword wielders lunged for the prince, but Ferdinand shot them both in the face, dropping them where they stood. He then bound the two who seemed to have been exposed to trug. They needed someone alive to question.</p><p>He went to join Anastasius who had wrested Sigiswald’s feystone from his captive.</p><p>“They’re traitors!” the man yelled. “All of Ehrenfest are traitors! Rozemyne knows how to get the Grutrissheit, but she’s hiding it from you! She may already have it!”</p><p>“Silence!” Anastasius barked. “I’m not interested in your lies! Tell me how you got this feystone!”</p><p>Ferdinand wondered briefly how the prince would react if he learned the truth, but that didn’t matter. What mattered was saving Rozemyne.</p><p>“You don’t understand!” the man continued. “Did Rozemyne tell you she knows the way to the Grutrissheit? She didn’t, right? She’s a traitor! She’s trying to get the book for herself! She’s–urk!”</p><p>Anastasius slammed his foot into the man’s gut. “Tell. Me. How. You. Got. This. Stone.”</p><p>“Your Highness, please!” he gasped. “She’s a traitor!”</p><p>“Gag him,” Anastasius commanded, and one of his guard knights moved to obey. “I’ll get answers the other way.”</p><p>That made the man start thrashing in protest.</p><p>Ferdinand approached the prince. “Prince Anastasius, I need the stone.”</p><p>“What?” he gasped. “No!”</p><p>“I only need it for a moment. You can have it back after that.”</p><p>“Absolutely not!” Anastasius said, holding it close to his chest.</p><p>“<em>Give me the stone!</em>” Ferdinand yelled. He didn’t have time for this. Rozemyne was <em>right there</em>, and the key was within his grasp, if only the fool prince would <em>hand it over already!</em></p><p>Eckhart and Aub Dunkelfelger barged in just as a teary-eyed Anastasius yelled, “You can’t have my brother’s feystone!”</p><p><em>I’m going to turn</em> you <em>into a feystone if you don’t–!</em></p><p>Ferdinand wiped the thought from his mind. “Then hurry and open the door to his hidden room!” His objective was to save Rozemyne. If he couldn’t use the stone, then he’d have to use Anastasius.</p><p>“Why?!”</p><p><em>This damned fool!</em> Why the hell did he think Ferdinand wanted it open? The only reason the prince would have his guard knights slaughter Sigiswald’s knights was because he knew Rozemyne was kidnapped. Was it that hard to understand?</p><p>“<em>Rozemyne is inside!</em>” he retorted, spelling it out for him as he would a child. “Who knows if another of Prince Sigiswald’s guard knights is in there with her?!”</p><p>That finally got the man moving. Ferdinand’s heart nearly melted with relief when the door opened, but it clenched in panic when he saw her hair had been taken down.</p><p>Which one had done it?</p><p>Which one had <em>touched his Rozemyne</em>?!</p><p>The brief moment of panic passed when he saw she was holding her hair sticks like weapons. It seemed she’d discovered what the magic circles on her flower hairpin did.</p><p>Of course she did. He’d trained her, after all.</p><p>When she saw him, her anger faded, and hope bloomed in her beautiful eyes. She ran towards him, but she bounced off an invisible barrier.</p><p>Fire coursed through his veins as the implications of that flashed through his mind. They’d taken away her schtappe and put her in a room she couldn’t escape with a single key that likely would have been lost had they not arrived in time.</p><p>What a horrible way to climb the towering staircase. He would visit one much worse upon whoever had set this trap. At that moment, though, he needed her safe in his arms.</p><p>When he, too, bounced off the barrier, his blood ran cold. How had they set the parameters for the room?!</p><p>Thankfully, Anastasius was at least competent enough to change the restrictions without being told. The moment the barrier dropped, Rozemyne flew into Ferdinand’s waiting arms, burying her face in his chest as she shook like a frightened shumil.</p><p>She was here. She was safe. She was in his arms, and he didn’t know if he could ever let her go again, not after the torment he suffered for the last few bells.</p><p>Metal pressed into him, and he pulled back. “Let’s get these off of you,” he said. After removing the schtappe-sealing cuffs, he wanted to gather her in another embrace, one that she could actually return this time, but he’d already breached social etiquette enough for one night. Proper hugs could wait until they were in private.</p><p>After she downed a potion, he passed her a sound-blocking tool as Liseletta took Rozemyne’s hairpins from her and started tying up her hair in a simple bun.</p><p>“What happened, Rozemyne?”</p><p>She told him of how she was led to the villa under the guise of a royal summons and how they cuffed her when she tried to pull out an ordonnanz to contact him and Sylvester. “Nikolaus was literally a hair’s breadth from killing one of Sigiswald’s guard knights before I ordered him to stand down,” she said. “I think the tip of his sword might have actually touched the knight’s nose.”</p><p>“Hmm… Going for the unprotected face,” Ferdinand muttered. “Not a bad move.”</p><p>“It would have been a bad move if any of my retainers had actually attacked Prince Sigiswald’s guard knights!” she protested. “I told them their job was to defend, not harm.” She glanced over at the two men Ferdinand had killed and shuddered as she turned back to him. “It seems my message might not have been clear enough.”</p><p>“It doesn’t matter,” Ferdinand assured her. “Continue.”</p><p>“Well,” she said, putting a hand on her cheek, “they brought me upstairs for ‘questioning,’ but when I realized they were taking me to a bedroom, I thought…” She shuddered again. “My guard knights thought so, too, and when they moved to defend me, Sigiswald’s men started fighting to restrain them. I saw Berthilde get cuffed before that man over there dragged me in here. You have no idea how relieved I was when he just tossed me in the hidden room and left.”</p><p>He was certain he felt just as relieved.</p><p>Rozemyne’s explanation was cut short as Matthias ran in the room and rushed to her side.</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne,” he said, “I must offer you my deepest apologies. It is my greatest failing that I was unable to protect you as a guard knight.”</p><p>“Stand, Matthias,” she said. “There’s nothing to apologize for. You did what you were told.”</p><p>He’d just stood when he had to drop to a knee again as Trauerqual entered the room. They didn’t have to kneel for long. After Trauerqual was given the devastating news of his worthless son’s demise and went to inspect the culprit, Ferdinand said, “Matthias, if it weren’t for you coming to find me, Rozemyne would not have been found. No one could have guessed she would be in Prince Sigiswald’s hidden room.”</p><p>Rozemyne nodded. “That’s right. You not only saved my life but your fellow retainers’ as well, including your fiancée. Who, by the way, you should probably go check on.”</p><p>His eyes brimmed with gratitude as he thanked her and went to join the others.</p><p>Activating the sound-blocking tool again, he turned to Rozemyne and said, “Let me give you a health check.” He touched her neck and wrist, checking her temperature and measuring her pulse. When he checked her mana flow, her mouth pulled into a tight line, her cheeks colored, and for the briefest moment, she looked at him in a way that would haunt his dreams. She immediately tried to hide it, but the effort only made her look upset.</p><p>They both needed a distraction, but before he could ask her to continue her story, Anastasius called her over. She, the prince, the king, and Aub Dunkelfelger started talking with sound-blocking tools. At some point in the conversation, both Anastasius and Aub Dunkelfelger gave him a disconcerted look. Whatever question Anastasius asked made her blush with embarrassment, and her answer seemed to appease the two men somewhat.</p><p>What Ferdinand wouldn’t give to have Justus beside him right then.</p><p>They eventually let her return, and Ferdinand handed the sound-blocking tool back to her and asked, “What did they ask that made you turn Geduldh’s noble color?”</p><p>“I did?” she asked.</p><p>He frowned at her, and she sighed. “I told them about the anti-man flower hairpin. Thanks for giving me that without even telling me, by the way.”</p><p>Ferdinand raised a brow. “How did you even find out about it?”</p><p>“That is not the question you should be asking right now!” she complained. “See, this is why people call you Ewigeliebe.”</p><p>“I’m no Ewigeliebe.”</p><p>“Says the man who gave a ten-year-old a weaponized anti-man flower hairpin <em>without telling her!</em> That’s the part I’m upset about. You said you’d be open with me, but you didn’t say a word! And don’t tell me you forgot with that perfect memory of yours!”</p><p>She huffed and then said, “Anyway, to answer your question, Professor Hirschur told me. I noticed last year that some of the carvings on the stick were magic circles, so I asked her about it when I was doing joint research with Raimund. She found it <em>fascinating</em> how it compared a man’s mana to what was infused in the thread of the flower and activated if they didn’t match.”</p><p>Furrowing his brow, he said, “You didn’t tell me you’d spoken to Professor Hirschur about it.”</p><p>“Excuse me?” she asked. “Hi, Pot. Meet Kettle.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“It means you’re being hypocritical! I was waiting for you to tell me about it, but you never did! You know, it’s a good thing I was wearing this one today. I’ve actually been wearing it every time I go to the hidden room to see if you’d say something, and I wore it yesterday and today. You either didn’t notice or weren’t planning on coming clean.”</p><p>…It wasn’t that he <em>wouldn’t</em> tell her about it. He just hadn’t…yet. They had so many other important things to discuss that the flower hairpin never came to mind during their conversations. He didn’t want to talk about it where other people could hear, either, so that it would be another secret weapon for her.</p><p>“She thought it was interesting how you got it to differentiate between genders,” Rozemyne said, pulling him out of thoughts. “She didn’t even know you could do that.”</p><p>Magic worked under certain principles, unless it was being used by Rozemyne, so after the incident at the Goddess’s Bath where he and the other men in their party had been barred entry, all he had to do was determine how it worked. It was easy enough after that.</p><p>Regardless, this wasn’t what he wanted to talk about. “You never mentioned seeing Sigiswald.”</p><p>“Because I didn’t,” she sighed. “He was already…”</p><p>Ferdinand furrowed his brows. What purpose would murdering Sigiswald and then kidnapping Rozemyne and her retainers serve? Had they planned to implicate Ehrenfest in the crime? That would have gotten the guard knights executed for their failure to protect a prince from a group of apprentice knights, scholars, and attendants, only two of which were archnobles since Matthias had gotten away. How would they have gotten the guard knights to play along, then? At least two of them had been trugged, but the one who’d attacked Rozemyne didn’t appear to have been. Was he a true believer, willing to sacrifice his life for his master’s plot?</p><p>He didn’t know for certain who was behind this. Georgine had only cared about Ehrenfest and didn’t make a move against the royal family. Leonzio had focused on Ahrensbach, and Gervasio had come to the Royal Academy, but he hadn’t sent assassins ahead of time. Was it Raublut, then? If so, why kill the most easily-manipulated royal?</p><p>There was this “Lucius” as well. Ferdinand still didn’t know if he was someone he knew or not since he hadn’t come to the Interduchy Tournament.</p><p>Was it really as simple as having Ehrenfest take the blame for Sigiswald’s murder?</p><p>Anastasius interrupted his thoughts by dismissing them, telling them no one was allowed to leave the Royal Academy until he said otherwise. Ferdinand held up his hand to escort Rozemyne, but she’d already stepped forward, not noticing the gesture. The blessing she gave Anastasius was breathtaking. It was similar to the one she’d given when she was taken from her family.</p><p>How fitting that she’d give it again to someone who’d lost a member of theirs.</p><p>Ferdinand should have expected this. Rozemyne had a soft spot for family, and it always pained her when she saw them separated, even if they had nothing to do with her. It was moments like this that lent credence to her sainthood.</p><p>When the party arrived back at the dorms, Sylvester immediately ran over, Wilfried, Charlotte, and Karstedt trailing behind.</p><p>Ferdinand felt guilty when he saw the confused but worried look on Karstedt’s face. He’d had to watch from afar as everything happened, not knowing anything other than what Dunkelfelger would win if Ehrenfest lost the ditter match. Sylvester had likely told him the basics of the situation since he couldn’t talk about the Grutrissheit’s involvement, which would have left him with more questions than answers.</p><p>“Rozemyne!” Sylvester called. “Are you alright?! What happened? They didn’t hurt you, did they?”</p><p>“Point me in their direction!” Wilfried said. “I’ll make them regret kidnapping my little sister!”</p><p>“Do you need healing, Sister?” Charlotte asked. “Shall I pray to Heilschmerz for you?”</p><p>“I’m just glad to see you’re safe,” Karstedt sighed with relief.</p><p>“Everyone, I know you’re happy to see Rozemyne,” Florencia said as she joined them, “but give her some space. I imagine she’s very tired and would like to rest. It’s been a long night for us all.”</p><p>Rozemyne smiled gratefully at her as Sylvester, Karstedt, and the kids backed off.</p><p>“You are okay, though, right?” Sylvester asked.</p><p>She nodded. “A bit drained, but nothing a kindness-infused potion and a good night’s sleep can’t fix. I thank you all ever so much for your concern. More importantly, Prince Anastasius has banned anyone from leaving the Royal Academy until further notice.”</p><p>“WHAT?!” Wilfried and Sylvester cried at the same time.</p><p>Lieseleta stepped forward then and said, “My lady, it is rather late. Now that everyone knows you’re safe, should we not prepare you for bed?”</p><p>“Yes, that sounds wonderful. If you will excuse me.”</p><p>Ferdinand tightened his grip on her hand. He couldn’t watch her walk away from him. Each time his ordonnanz refused to fly, he was certain she’d climbed to the distant heights again. The only thing that kept him from giving in to chaos was the hope that she’d been locked away in a hidden room, and even then…</p><p>He knew that he would attack even the gods if Rozemyne died. He didn’t know what he would do if they’d hurt her or tried to lay their filthy, frost-covered hands on her.</p><p>Rozemyne gave him a soft smile, her eyes saying she would meet him in his hidden room as soon as possible and to hold on until then.</p><p>It took all of his willpower, but he managed to let her go. The moment she was out of sight, his lungs stopped working. Dread trailed down his throat and filled his sinking stomach.</p><p>Tonight had been a near miss. If Rozemyne hadn’t given her name-sworn knight that amulet of Verbergen, he might not have ever found her. The traitors had picked the perfect time to take her - closing time at the library after most people had left the Academy. No one would have been wandering the halls. It would have been as if she and her entire entourage had vanished.</p><p>The royal family would have eventually discovered Sigiswald’s climb to the distant heights, but Ferdinand wouldn’t have any cause to suspect he’d taken her. If anything, he’d suspect whoever killed Sigiswald was responsible for her disappearance as well. He never would have thought they’d put her in a dead prince’s hidden room.</p><p>If it weren’t for Matthias, he would have lost her.</p><p>As Rozemyne’s scholars and knights started heading for the stairs, Ferdinand called Matthias over. The young man was tense, his eyes shaking slightly in fear. He tensed even more when Ferdinand knelt before him, took his hand, and pressed his forehead against it.</p><p>The room fell completely silent. “Matthias, I cannot thank you enough. Had it not been for you, I might have lost Rozemyne forever. You have my utmost gratitude.”</p><p>“I-I-I was just d-doing my d-duty,” Matthias stammered. “I-I’d d-do anything to protect my l-lady.”</p><p>Ferdinand stood, looked him in the eye, and said, “I will hold you to that.”</p><p>He gulped. “Y-yes, Knight Co-Commander.”</p><p>Ferdinand dismissed him and turned to tell Janrik to follow him so he could prepare for bed only to find the man trying desperately to hold back a wave of tears. With a sigh, he ordered him to go find somewhere else to be emotional and told Justus to act as his attendant. When he turned to leave, he found the archducal family and Karstedt gaping at him - even Florencia.</p><p>His ears burning, he marched across the room and up the stairs, cursing himself for thanking Matthias in front of others. Sylvester was going to tease both of them mercilessly.</p><p>“Shall you take a bath before bed?” Justus asked.</p><p>“Yes,” Ferdinand said. He always needed to bathe after sending someone up the towering staircase. Something about the act left him feeling unclean. He needed to relax, anyway, and Justus was a master at scalp massages.</p><p>As he lay back in the tub, Ferdinand tried not to think about anything that had happened that day. Trying to piece together his enemies’ plans could wait until he was out of the bath.</p><p>After wetting his hair, Justus began massaging rinsham into his scalp. The fragrant, floral scent was the one Rozemyne used the most. While it was exceedingly feminine, it was a comfort to be surrounded by her scent as he tried to let the tension drain from his body. It felt like a constant reminder that she was still alive.</p><p>It was such a foolish thing, but as he lay in bed that evening, he kept bringing his hair to his nose to enjoy Rozemyne’s fragrance. <em>She’s still with me,</em> he thought each time. <em>They didn’t take her from me.</em></p><p>First bell was chiming when Schlaftraum decided to bless him. His eyes had just fluttered closed when Janrik’s panicked voice stirred him. “Lord Ferdinand!”</p><p>He sat bolt upright, his schtappe in his hand. “What is it?”</p><p>Janrik pulled open the curtain and said, “We have to get you dressed right now!” He waved to the tunic and pants he wore under his armor.</p><p>“What’s the meaning of this?” Ferdinand demanded as he got out of bed and pulled off his nightshirt to help speed things along.</p><p>Janrik came back with the shirt and slipped it over his master’s head. “We just received word that Ehrenfest is under attack.”</p>

<p>My brother was gone. My insufferable, petty, selfish brother was gone. He was arrogant. He was foolish. He was…</p><p>He was my big brother.</p><p>We hadn’t gotten on in recent years, really since we’d started competing for Eglantine’s hand, but when we were younger, I looked up to him. He was the older brother who played with me as a child. He gifted me my favorite pen on my tenth birthday. He told me what to expect on my first day at the Royal Academy. He’d been my model for how to act as a prince when I was young.</p><p>And now he was gone. I’d just seen him earlier at the graduation ceremony, but I didn’t talk to him. I was still so angry about his latest ploy to get between me and Eglantine. He’d been sending people to follow her for a couple of years, starting soon after her adoption. Two weeks ago, he had one of his people pretend he was in my retinue and say I sent him to watch her every move.</p><p>Fortunately, she recognized it for the lie it was, but it still infuriated me. Not quite as much as finding out that Hildebrand’s food has been tampered with, but still enough for me to ignore him during the Interduchy Tournament and graduation ceremony.</p><p>If I had known it would be the last time I ever saw him, I would have spoken to him. He hadn’t listened before, even sometimes acting like he didn’t know what I was talking about, but maybe if I had tried harder. Maybe if I had paid more attention, I would have noticed his guard knights were acting against him.</p><p>What was the last thing I said to him? It’d only been a couple of weeks since we’d spoken. Why couldn’t I remember what I’d said to him? Whatever it was, it was most likely not positive.</p><p>I looked down at the feystone in my hand, its colors running together through my tears. This was all that was left of him. This stone that fit in the palm of my hand.</p><p>“Sigiswald… Why?”</p><p>Why did he have to act so foolishly? Why did he ignore the signs that his people were plotting against him? Why did he have to leave a wife and unborn child behind? How lacking would that child be for not receiving enough mana from its father?</p><p>There was the practical side to this, too. We didn’t have enough suppliers as it was. So many tools were deactivated. One had crumbled to dust. Father was downing so many potions that he was always dancing on the line of toxicity. Losing Sigiswald’s mana, especially when his wife couldn’t supply any, meant losing even more tools, even with the Dedication Rituals reducing the burden somewhat.</p><p>I needed to focus. Father would be coming back with the memory searching tool soon, if he hadn’t already. Taking several deep breaths, I brought my sobbing down to whimpering. It would take another few moments to stop crying completely.</p><p>To help bury my emotions, I recalled the breathtaking blessing Rozemyne had bestowed upon me. Those cuffs had been set to mid-mednoble level, and she’d already expended mana sending the blessings that alerted me to her plight. Even after losing the vast majority of her mana, she still gave so much just to offer me a little comfort.</p><p>I was under no illusions about her mana - she’d have definitely developed mana sensing by now, and I couldn’t feel her <em>at all.</em> Losing as much as she did must have been extremely uncomfortable, and yet she gave even more.</p><p>Gods, she would have been such a boon to the royal family. When I first saw her, I had thought it strange that one so young was already engaged, though from her jewelry alone it was plain to see her fiancé was an Ewigeliebe in the worst way. Combining that with her temple upbringing and Ferdinand’s position as High Priest at the time, it was easy enough to draw…certain conclusions. The more I saw of her, the less I wanted her to suffer Geduldh’s fate. I had offered her a way out a couple of times, thinking she might have felt she had no choice but to marry her much-older fiancé.</p><p>Tonight’s display proved that to be false. She truly was lost in spring for him. It was just as well. The two of them probably matched in mana, or at least came close. She would have been trapped in a white marriage with me, a man who didn’t desire her that way in the first place. She was gorgeous to be sure, and beyond exceptional, but my heart had always belonged to Eglantine.</p><p>Even so, I couldn’t help but regret her denial just a bit. There were worse things than being married to someone you counted an ally or - dare I say it - a dear friend, and the value of what she would bring to the royal family was unfathomable. If she was happy with her Dark God, though, and he treated her with respect, then that was all I could really ask for.</p><p>Her blessing must have worked because even thinking about it had calmed me enough to stop crying for now. With a sigh, I pushed myself to my feet, waschened my face, and left the hidden room.</p><p>I had excellent timing. Father had returned with the memory searching tool. He and Aub Dunkelfelger, whom my father treated with suspicious deference, were discussing who would use it on Darius, Sigiswald’s head guard knight who’d trapped Rozemyne in his hidden room. They turned when they noticed my approach.</p><p>“Hello, Son,” my father said. “I’m glad you were able to join us.”</p><p>I returned his greeting with a nod and said, “If you’re trying to decide who should use the tool, we can use Drewanchel’s newly-developed paper to see who’s the closest match.”</p><p>“We’d have to acquire some, and I have no intention of waking Aub Drewanchel in the middle of the night nor alerting him to our current state of affairs,” Father said with a shake of his head.</p><p>“I have some with me,” I said.</p><p>My father looked at me a bit skeptically. “Why would you have that paper with you?”</p><p>“I was gifted some at the Interduchy Tournament yesterday, and I hadn’t removed it from my pouch.” I couldn’t tell them the truth - that I wanted to use it to see how compatible I was with Eglantine. She’d been taking refuge in the second queen’s palace so much in recent months that I wasn’t sure when I’d be in the same room with her again, so I kept a small piece in my pouch just in case.</p><p>“Very well,” Father sighed. “That will save us a little time and mana.”</p><p>The paper worked by infusing it with mana to see who was the most compatible person in the room. I doubted Darius would willingly give any mana, but fortunately for us, he had plenty of blood ready to use. After having our guard knights remove the other prisoners and wait in the hall, I touched the paper to one of his wounds and dropped it on the ground.</p><p>It was a bit sluggish, but it crept towards me. I had hoped it would go to Aub Dunkelfelger so neither I nor my father would have to witness my brother’s ascent to the distant heights.</p><p>Well, better me than him. This was the second child my father lost due to political machinations. I didn’t want to increase his suffering.</p><p>I steeled my resolve and had my knights prepare Darius to be read while I sent one of them to my villa to retrieve a synchronization potion for me.</p><p>After forcing the traitor to take the potion, we waited for him to fall asleep and then placed the tool on his forehead. Once mine was on as well, I leaned down and stepped into his mind.</p><p>
<em>Get out!</em>
</p><p>I snorted. <em>Nice try. Now, how’d you get Sigiswald’s feystone?</em></p><p>A fragment of a memory flashed before my eyes. Sigiswald came out of his hidden room. My hands reached up, lifting a small, silver tube. I held my breath and pulled the string hanging out of the end. Powder exploded in Sigiswald’s face, and his feystone clattered against the floor.</p><p>The memory cut off as quickly as it had come, but I was able to confirm both the culprit and the means.</p><p>That was the trick to interrogating unwilling participants. If I asked a relevant question, he wouldn’t be able to stop himself from thinking about it, even if for a brief moment. I just had to choose the right questions and pay close attention.</p><p>
<em>Where did you get the poison?</em>
</p><p>This time, the memory was hazy. Sounds were so distorted as to be indistinguishable from one another, and my vision swam as though I were looking at the scene through tears. I couldn’t glean any useful information, save that trug had been employed.</p><p>Darius laughed. <em>You’ll never get the answers you seek.</em></p><p><em>We’ll see about that.</em> His memory of Sigiswald’s murder was clear. I was willing to bet several others were as well.</p><p> </p><p>I gasped as I jerked back, breaking my connection to the criminal. Father placed a hand on my shoulder and asked, “Are you alright?”</p><p><em>No</em>, I thought, but I nodded anyway. “This is…inconceivable,” I said. “Let’s go into the hidden room to talk.”</p><p>Father motioned for Aub Dunkelfelger to join us, rousing my suspicions once again. After the door closed behind us, I started to explain what I saw.</p><p>Darius had been close with Raublut, as were many of the Sovereign knights. He, as a high-mana archnoble, had been a frequent visitor of the Adalgisa palace, though thankfully his memories of the time spent there were muddled. There were far too many reasons trug would have been employed there, and I didn’t want to consider them. I was glad Father closed it off.</p><p>Darius, however, had been incensed, but he had no choice but to accept it.</p><p>Until he began working with Raublut. They bonded over a shared attachment to the palace, though the former knight commander seemed to lament the loss of a single flower rather than the garden Darius longed for. Further relevant meetings between the two were unclear, but I was able to feel his renewed hope in them.</p><p>Thankfully, most of his memories related to Sigiswald’s murder were clear. One of Eglantine’s attendants had told him Rozemyne knew something about how to find the Grutrissheit. He sent word to someone via magic letter, meaning either he didn’t want to risk anyone overhearing him, or he was contacting someone outside the Sovereignty. He soon received a reply with orders.</p><p>He was to kill Sigiswald with the poison he’d received and approach Rozemyne after the graduation ceremony when there would be no witnesses but before Ferdinand and Aub Ehrenfest left the Academy. Then, he needed to take her and her retainers to Sigiswald’s villa, cuff them, use my brother’s feystone to lock her in his hidden room, and get information about the Grutrissheit from her. Once he had what he needed, he could dispose of them all and then pass their feystones along with Sigiswald’s off to Eglantine’s retainer in the morning before first bell.</p><p>His questioning of Rozemyne had been the second hardest memory to watch next to my brother’s ascent to the distant heights. He’d started by demanding she tell him what she knew of the Grutrissheit.</p><p>“It’s proof of one’s right to rule,” she responded, her demeanor calm despite the terror she must have been feeling. “It’s used to–”</p><p>“No,” he barked. “Tell me about how to get it!”</p><p>She tilted her head in confusion. “I suppose it’s passed down from generation to generation of zents, but it’s been lost for some time now, right?”</p><p>He slammed his fist against the wall above her, causing her to jolt. “Don’t play coy with me. Mestionora revealed the path to you, didn’t she?”</p><p>Her face went blank. “My deepest apologies, but I’m not sure what you’re talking about.”</p><p>“It has something to do with her statue, doesn’t it?”</p><p>Her large, golden eyes blinked up at him owlishly. “Because she’s holding the Grutrissheit, maybe?”</p><p>He moved to backhand her, but his hand met a barrier just before it touched her. A light on her upper arm flashed just before a high-powered attack launched at him. He stepped back in time to avoid the worst of it, though it still slashed through his arm and crashed against Sigiswald’s desk, cutting it in half.</p><p>“Charms, huh?” he growled. “You can’t have that many that block the same kind of attack.” He punched at her, receiving a blow at least three times as strong in return. The follow up kick earned him a strong enough counter to drop him to his knees. By then, Rozemyne had pulled out her hair sticks and was towering over him with eyes swimming in a rainbow of colors.</p><p>The schtappe-sealing cuffs prevented her Crushing from being too effective, but when he weathered her mana and approached her, she slapped him in the face with the flower hairpin. sending a lightning strike straight through him. He didn’t have time to recover before she hit him a second time, sending him flying and slamming him against the ceiling on the far side of the room. He crashed to the ground along with the contents of Sigiswald’s shelves.</p><p>He groaned in pain as he gathered himself enough to reach for the door. As he slipped out, he grumbled, “I’d hoped to avoid this, Princess, but you’ve left me no choice. Let’s see how many retainers I have to torture and kill before you start talking.”</p><p>Rozemyne’s eyes widened in panic, and she threw her hands in the air as he slammed the door shut. He hobbled towards the bedroom door, planning to bring the first-year attendant back, certain Rozemyne would break before he even raised a hand against the child.</p><p>Just as he reached the doorway, he heard us storming the villa. In a panic, he spun around and made for the hidden room only to be caught by my bands of light just before he could reach it.</p><p>It made me wonder if the yellow blessing Rozemyne had sent was from Dregarnuhr because the timing had been excellent.</p><p>“We need to grab Eglantine’s retainer,” Aub Dunkelfelger said when I finished explaining what I’d seen.</p><p>I pulled out an ordonnanz, but he stopped me. “Wait. If that attendant overhears your message, she’ll run or send herself up the towering staircase.”</p><p>“Well, we can’t go to Queen Clementia’s palace,” I protested. “Father can, but he can’t bring enough guards in with him to capture a prisoner, and she might not be the only traitor among them. I’ll try to phrase it in a way that won’t tip her attendant off.”</p><p>“No, it’ll be too suspicious for you to send an ordonnanz this late at night,” Father said. He paused for a moment and lifted a brow at me. “Yes?”</p><p>I nodded. Did he really think I would stoop so low as to harass Eglantine in the middle of the night? After how terribly I’d bungled things during our last year at the Academy, I knew better than to try to violate her privacy again.</p><p>“What do we do, then?” I demanded.</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger crossed his arms. “We wait for her to come get the stones and snag her then. She was coming here, no? Come, let us sit in the foyer until the designated time. If she doesn’t appear by first bell, then it won’t matter if you contact Eglantine or not. The attendant will already know their plan has gone awry.”</p><p>We waited in tense silence, none of us daring to speak. Father’s eyes looked more sunken than usual, and his shoulders slumped as he stared into nothingness. I had been afforded the luxury of a hidden room whereas he had not. I didn’t know how he managed to suppress the pain as well as he did.</p><p>
<em>Is it because this isn’t the first time he’s lost a child?</em>
</p><p>If it hurt this much losing a brother, I couldn’t imagine the agony of seeing your child’s feystone. If someone had done that to a child I had with Eglantine, I… I didn’t know what I would do. I certainly couldn’t sit in silent grief and maintain even the modicum of royal presence my father still exuded.</p><p>Just before first bell rang, a quiet knock came at the door. Father nodded at his guard knight as everyone got into position and readied their schtappes.</p><p>The woman entered, but the moment she saw who was waiting for her, she turned on her heel. Father caught her in bands of light, but they broke apart as they enveloped her. Aub Dunkelfelger, my knights, and I gave chase. The aub shot a magic attack at her, but it dissipated harmlessly off her silver cloak. With a growl, he enhanced his speed and shot forward, grabbing her cape and yanking her back.</p><p>The aub had failed to modulate his strength in his battle rush, and he’d sent her flying towards me. I braced myself, but Cassius, one of my knights, caught her just before she made impact. As he restrained her, I walked over and hissed, “What were you planning to do with my brother’s feystone?”</p><p>She stared at me wide eyed and shook her head.</p><p>Another one we would have to read. I ordered my knight to remove the strange cloak that seemed to block our attacks so that we could bind her. She tried to jerk free of his grip, and then–</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Something warm splattered across my face and over my chest, filling my mouth with the taste of copper. Soft chunks of matter stuck to me and slowly slid down my forehead, cheeks, and neck. My eyes stung, and my ears rang.</p><p>My skin crawled as I pulled out a handkerchief and wiped my face as best I could. When I opened my eyes and saw the gore covering the walls, the ceiling, the floor, and me, I stumbled back and fell to one knee. Suddenly aware of why I tasted copper, I leaned over and retched. It was unbecoming of a royal, but I couldn’t control all my bodily functions.</p><p>My knight cast waschen over the area, and I’d never been so grateful to inhale water in my life. I was left coughing when it vanished, but at least I no longer had blood in my mouth.</p><p>I managed to get back on my feet, but I nearly lost my stomach again when I saw Cassius holding a corpse with a mangled neck in place of a head. “Gods,” I breathed.</p><p>“First time’s always the worst,” Aub Dunkelfelger said. “Come, let us return to the villa.”</p><p>“But the evidence–”</p><p>“Isn’t here,” he said. “Not anymore. Have your knights search her body and bring back the silver cape. I’ve never seen anything like it, but it blocked your father’s binding, so there’s something special about it.”</p><p>I nodded to Cassius to do as ordered and followed behind the aub, focusing on the embroidery on his blue cloak, trying to take in each stitch so that I wouldn’t have to think about what I’d just seen. Try as I might, though, I couldn’t get past the feeling that something warm and wet was still sliding down my face or that copper was filling my nose and mouth.</p><p>When we returned to the villa, Father looked at us expectantly only to deflate when I shook my head. “She… Her head just…”</p><p>Father had a sharp intake of breath, and then he walked over and patted my shoulder. “The first time is always the worst,” he said.</p><p>“So Aub Dunkelfelger said,” I muttered. “I… I should contact Eglantine. She might–”</p><p>“Be in danger if you alert any other possible spies to the fact that we know,” Aub Dunkelfelger finished.</p><p>Father sighed and rubbed at his forehead. “So there went our most promising lead.”</p><p>The aub froze for a moment and then smiled. “Maybe not.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” I asked.</p><p>He looked to Father who nodded back in deference. Just why was he–?</p><p>My eyes widened as the aub held out his hand and chanted, “Grutrissheit.” He noticed my expression and shrugged. “Eh, you would have found out soon enough.”</p><p>“H-How…?” I stammered. Then, I shook my head as I focused on the situation at hand. “How will the Grutrissheit help us discover what our enemies are up to?”</p><p>His grin broadened as he explained, “The Book of Mestionora is a collection of memories from everyone with a schtappe and high enough mana that has climbed the towering staircase. Assuming our spy had archnoble levels of mana since she was serving the royal family…” He held the book out and glared at it. As if intimidated, it immediately fell open on a specific page. His eyes ran over the text as he mumbled to himself things like, “Oh, I see,” and “Huh, okay.”</p><p>It was infuriating.</p><p>Eventually, he froze as his eyes widened. Then, he looked up at me and my father and said, “She was going to use Sigiswald’s feystone to open the Farthest Hall.”</p><p>“What?” I demanded as my father asked, “Why?”</p><p>The aub - well, at least for now - turned back to the book and said, “She was supposed to wait for Raublut, who would be bringing guests with him.”</p><p>“But Raublut’s dead,” I protested.</p><p>“Oh, that’s simple enough, then,” he said, closing the book. He glared at it again, but nothing happened. “Hmm… I know Raublut had enough mana to warrant an entry, so either he died without a schtappe, or he’s still alive.”</p><p>“But he… He exploded!”</p><p>Father shook his head. “People have faked deaths before. We should not have been so complacent.”</p><p>“Wait,” I said. “‘Guests’?”</p><p>An ordonnanz flew in, drawing all of our attention. Everyone held out an arm, and it alighted on mine.</p><p><em>”Prince Anastasius, this is Aub Ehrenfest,”</em> it said. <em>”I am requesting permission for us to return to Ehrenfest. Our duchy is under attack by Ahrensbach.”</em></p><p>We all stared at the bird in stunned silence as it repeated the message twice more before reverting to a feystone. I tapped it and said, “You may depart immediately.”</p><p>Taking out another yellow feystone, Aub Dunkelfelger activated it and said, “Ferdinand! This is Aub Dunkelfelger! I will send fifty knights to support you. Can you prepare enough badges to let them through the dormitory?”</p><p>The response came, “<em>It will take time to gather them. Would it not be faster to use the country gate?</em>”</p><p>He frowned in contemplation. “Will your aub be able to teleport them from the country gate to wherever they’re needed?”</p><p>“<em>Yes.</em>”</p><p>Nodding to himself, Aub Dunkelfelger looked at us and said, “Waschen all of the Sovereign Knights Order and have them protect the Farthest Hall. Alert the rest of the royal family to what’s going on. I will send knights to secure the Royal Academy. If you see Raublut, kill him. He won’t let himself be taken alive, anyway, and we can get the rest of his plans from his entry in the Book of Mestionora. Whatever you do, ensure that they cannot open the Farthest Hall.”</p><p>“Wait!” I said before he could run out the door. “That poison they used on Sigiswald came from a silver tube! Have everyone wear masks so they won’t breathe it in!”</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger paused for a moment and then burst into laughter. “Oh, I see. I see. Very clever. Very clever indeed. Just as one would expect!”</p><p>What he was expecting, I wasn’t sure, but I didn’t have time to contemplate it. Father and I both started sending ordonnanzes. Thankfully, no one else in the royal family had been slain.</p><p>Father and I left Sigiswald’s villa to prepare for war.</p>

<p>“Lady Detlinde, please focus on your work.”</p><p>I blinked, being dragged so rudely out of my thoughts. I’d been forced to sit at this desk for <em>bells,</em> filling out form after form, signing parchment after parchment. When Father had collapsed, my fiancé and I were forced to fill in, and even that was not enough. The stacks of paperwork left to do never seemed to shrink, no matter how fast I worked.</p><p>Lucius worked at the desk across the room, flying through forms and discussing various matters with the retainers Mother and Father had assigned him. His long brown hair was pulled back with a jeweled clip I’d gifted him, and his warm brown eyes crinkled with a smile whenever they met mine.</p><p><em>Such a handsome man,</em> I thought. <em>It’s such a shame he’s been marred by the temple, but what can I do? That insufferable flower from Ehrenfest ruined my engagement with Wilfried by tricking him into participating in some silly game to get engaged to someone else.</em> I heard Lady Hannelore was friends with that flower, and it showed. Such a shameless display!</p><p>The scholar admonished me again when my pen stopped moving, so I sighed and got back to signing documents. When fourth bell rang, I dropped my pen and stood. “Lucius, I do believe it’s time for lunch,” I said.</p><p>He looked up from the parchment he was discussing with his scholar and smiled. “Yes, I will join you momentarily.” He turned back to his work, and all the scholars in the room gravitated towards him as though I’d just been an annoyance. They didn’t care what I thought. Any time I tried to look into things more, I was told to focus on signing, not reading.</p><p>I was the one that was supposed to be Aub Ahrensbach one day. Why did they all listen to him, not me? Hadn’t I been trying? Why wouldn’t they acknowledge me like I deserved?</p><p>
<em>Why are they taking someone who lived in the temple his whole life more seriously than me, the future aub?</em>
</p><p>Even Mother acknowledged him. In the past year, she’d spoken with him more than she had in the past two years with me. Ever since I graduated, she grew even more distant than before. Nothing I did grabbed her attention. Nothing was ever good enough.</p><p>
<em>Is signing papers really all anyone thinks I can do?</em>
</p><p>I’d graduated from the archduke candidate course, hadn’t I? I’d even danced as the Goddess of Light! Yet my mother had not a single word of praise for me.</p><p>Well, I would show them. For the past couple of seasons, I’d been leaving my head scholar behind whenever I left the office and Lucius stayed behind. She listened for any information that she could use to help me better my position. I’d been having tea with Letizia, too, sometimes, since she was being tutored by Lucius’s retainers as well. Letizia never seemed to know anything of importance as far as I could tell, but my scholars and attendants said otherwise. I would have to trust their judgment.</p><p>I broke out in goosebumps. “Again?” I sighed. Lanzenave had been sending more and more ships this past year. Lucius and I always went to greet them, so I went with my attendants to change into my riding clothes. “I might as well stay in these,” I griped. “They’ve had so many people in the estate that we’re preparing more food from them than for the actual castle.”</p><p>“Not recently, my lady,” Martina said. “The amount of food being taken to them has been decreasing these past three weeks.”</p><p>I frowned at that. “Martina, when was the last time we had a ship from Lanzenave?”</p><p>“Five days ago.”</p><p>“And before that?”</p><p>“Seven days ago.”</p><p>“And before that?”</p><p>“...Four weeks ago.”</p><p>That didn’t seem right. “Shouldn’t the numbers have been the same until last week, then?” I asked. “Where are they going if not home?”</p><p>“Perhaps they are simply eating less?” Fatiehe suggested.</p><p>That didn’t seem right, either. “Karoline,” I called to my scholar, “what do you think?”</p><p>Karoline tapped her pen against the wooden board in her hand, an annoying habit but one I had to allow. She was one of the nosiest people I’d ever met, but she somehow always knew answers to my questions.</p><p>
<em>She’s a valuable resource. If I don’t know something, she normally does, so I can always seem reliable.</em>
</p><p>Of course, it wasn’t like my mother noticed how much more reliable I had become. She’d see one day, though. When I became aub, she would see how I would run the duchy. She’d give me the attention I deserved then.<br/>“I can’t say without exact numbers. If the decrease has been slowing gradually over the past few weeks, it might be that they brought their own food from the ship that came a month ago,” Karoline drawled, already getting on my nerves. “However, if it was a sudden and sharp decline, then…”</p><p>I stopped listening at that point. <em>Why can’t she just give me a straight answer? I don’t care about the rest of it. How is it even relevant to what I asked?</em></p><p>“Given all that,” Karoline said, finally getting to the point, “it seems likely the population in the estate has been decreasing despite the lack of ships to take them back to Lanzenave.”</p><p>That tugged at something else in my mind.</p><p>
<em>Didn’t this happen before, too? I think I remember asking about it, but…</em>
</p><p>It was no good. The fuzzy memory had already left.</p><p>“Well, that’s just as well,” I said. “It doesn’t really matter. Lanzenave can deal with Lanzenave’s problems. Let us go.”</p><p>My retainers followed me out of my rooms and to the balcony where Lucius awaited me. He smiled as beautifully as ever as he pulled out his highbeast. He’d been so slow with it at first, but he’d been having to use it so often that it had become second nature to him. We rode out to greet the new envoys, much to my discontent. This was work far beneath the future aub. They should have to come to <em>me</em>, not the other way around.</p><p>When we landed, a gentleman who somewhat resembled Lucius stepped off the ship and greeted us. I’d seen him before, but I couldn’t recall his name.</p><p>“Lord Leonzio,” Lucius said, “welcome back to Ahrensbach!”</p><p><em>Ah, that’s right. Leonzio. When did he come here last…?</em> I tried to recall as I let the envoys greet me. It wasn’t until we were flying back to the castle that I finally remembered. <em>Right! Didn’t he come in summer? I think he was the one who wanted the zent to accept a Lanzenave princess.</em></p><p>I was surprised I didn’t remember right away. Lucius had come back from the Royal Academy to greet him. Apparently, Mother had sent word to him as Leonzio was someone important in Lanzenave.</p><p>
<em>Doesn’t that mean he has Yurgenschmidt royal blood?</em>
</p><p>I couldn’t really remember the story about their country being founded and whatever agreement they’d had with us. I didn’t bother to listen too closely since no one would listen to what I had to say on the subject, anyway. I did remember, though, that the first Lanzenave king had been the zent’s brother or uncle. Maybe cousin? Either way, they were related.</p><p>It seemed he’d come back to ask for Lucius to ask the zent again to receive a Lanzenave princess. Once again, Lucius apologized for being unable to fulfill the request. “As I said this summer, I will not be able to speak with the zent until the Archduke Conference this spring. As of right now, I’m merely a fiancé to our lovely future aub.”</p><p>His compliment filled me with warmth. <em>It’s such a shame he’s from the temple. To think I’d have to marry a man who’d sullied himself with flowers, but at least he’s handsome, and he acknowledges me.</em> That was more than I could say for my own family. Father had collapsed a season ago, but nothing at all had changed from my perspective, save the extra work. I’d only ever seen him a few times in my life.</p><p>Mother was…</p><p>My thoughts were interrupted by Leonzio. “Lady Detlinde, might you appeal to the zent on our behalf? Lanzenave will surely crumble if Yurgenschmidt does not adhere to its part in our agreement.”</p><p>I narrowed my eyes behind my delightful smile. He hadn’t asked me in the summer, yet he’d asked Lucius, who’d just gotten his schtappe. He hadn’t even been a noble for a full year, but Leonzio had gone to him instead of me, the future aub.</p><p>“It is as Lord Lucius says,” I answered. “If the zent refuses a princess, that is that. We can appeal to him at the Archduke Conference, but there will not be an opportunity before then.”</p><p>“But Lanzenave–”</p><p>“Will not crumble between now and spring, no?” I interrupted. Just how simple did he think I was? “I understand you do not know how things work here in Yurgenschmidt, but I must ask you to remain patient. Perhaps you can use the time to craft an argument that will convince the zent. You surely cannot expect us to do that part, no?”</p><p>Lucius took my hand and placed it on my arm. “Forgive me, but it seems the first wife would like to greet you,” he said, nodding towards my mother. She stood regally just a few paces away, her dark green eyes locked on us, her red lips curved into a smile.</p><p><em>Though she’s smiling at Leonzio, not me.</em> It was never me.</p><p>“That was beautifully said, Lady Detlinde,” Lucius complimented me. “You are correct, of course, as usual.”</p><p>It was so pleasant to finally be acknowledged.</p><p><em>See, Mother? I can handle difficult negotiations with our foreign trade partners.</em> Surely when Leonzio told her what I said, she’d praise me.</p><p> </p><p>I was spending another mindless day signing paperwork. Snow had started to fall outside, yet the scholars kept me sitting at my desk, not allowing me to go to the window to watch. I still glanced at it from time to time, even though I got admonished for it.</p><p>
<em>Everything’s so boring. Why am I only being given this dull paperwork to do? What am I even signing that’s so important anyway? I’ve signed so many of these same-looking documents. Why do they need so many copies, anyway?</em>
</p><p>I looked at the page sitting before me a bit closer.</p><p>
<em>Wait… Isn’t this a baptismal certificate?</em>
</p><p>I wasn’t the most well-versed in administrative work, but I knew after nobles were baptized, a record was sent to the aub to sign and file away. I glanced at the paperwork yet to be done and saw the next several were more of the same. I’d already signed a hefty stack of them as well.</p><p>
<em>Haven’t I been signing a lot of documents that look like this? Have we really had that many children turn seven this year?</em>
</p><p>I couldn’t think of anything significant that would have increased the number of children born so suddenly, but then again, I didn’t do much paperwork before Lucius came, and it’d only been increasing ever since Father collapsed.</p><p>
<em>Still, isn’t it odd?</em>
</p><p>When fourth bell came, Lucius sent me on ahead again, so I went to my chambers to refresh myself before lunch. “Karoline,” I asked, “I feel like I’ve been signing more baptismal certificates recently compared to normal.”</p><p>Fatiehe, who was straightening my veil, stiffened.</p><p>“It could be,” my scholar muttered. “Though there doesn’t seem to be cause for a significant increase in the number of children born seven years ago, it might be that more low-manaed children are being claimed rather than sent to the temple or used as servants. We can compare…”</p><p>
<em>Ugh, can she just give me an answer already? I didn’t ask for a lecture.</em>
</p><p>“Given all that,” she said at last, “it might be worth investigating. I shall look into the anomaly, my lady.”</p><p>“See that you do,” I said, not really sure what she was investigating but feeling proud that I could order her to do it all the same.</p><p> </p><p>Yet another ship came from Lanzenave, but when I met Lucius on the balcony, he was glowing with excitement. The man still hadn’t learned to mask his emotions, but I didn’t mind. It made it easier to guess what he was thinking. I could tell instantly if he thought highly of what I said.</p><p>When we landed at the port, an older gentleman came to greet us, and I froze for a moment.</p><p>
<em>I’m sure I’ve never seen this man before, but he looks so familiar…</em>
</p><p>He smiled warmly at Lucius, but when he turned to talk to one of his men, his face became serious, and that was when it hit me.</p><p>
<em>He looks just like that flower’s fiancé! That older man from the temple who likes little girls!</em>
</p><p>The resemblance was uncanny. When he stood next to Lucius, they greatly favored each other as well. I sent a look at Karoline who stepped over with a sound-blocking tool.</p><p>“Karoline,” I said, “don’t they seem to resemble each other a bit too much?”</p><p>Her eyes darted between the two men, who were jovially chatting with each other, and she gave a slight nod. “Yes, my lady. Shall I look into it?”</p><p>
<em>Finally! A short, simple answer like I’ve always wanted!</em>
</p><p>“See that you do,” I said.</p><p>I joined my fiancé who introduced me to Lord Gervasio. It was my first time seeing him, and I’d seen Lanzenave envoys since my mother became first wife. Lucius, who only recently left the temple, however, seemed rather close with him.</p><p>
<em>Suspicious, indeed.</em>
</p><p>During Gervasio’s stay, he and Leonzio seemed to avoid each other. They rarely sat together or talked to each other. Lucius merely said, “We can’t expect everyone from Lanzenave to get along with each other, can we?”</p><p>Perhaps it was some sort of family feud. I could understand that. I’d never gotten along with my older brother when he was alive. He’d gotten all the attention from Mother.</p><p>About two weeks after he arrived, Gervasio met with Lucius, and I naturally came along as well since I was future aub. We couldn’t have my fiancé doing all the negotiating, not when I was so talented with it.</p><p>We met to talk under a sound-blocking barrier. Gervasio, unlike Leonzio, was understanding of the fact that we had to wait until spring to speak with the zent. That wasn’t the only difference, however.</p><p>“Lord Leonzio has already asked us to petition the zent to accept another Lanzenave princess,” Lucius informed Gervasio.</p><p>The older gentleman shook his head. “How unfortunate. I do not believe that would be in anyone’s best interest, least of all the princess’s.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” I asked.</p><p>My fiancé and the visitor both gave me troubled looks before Lucius asked, “How familiar are you with the agreement between Yurgenschmidt and Lanzenave?”</p><p>A sweet scent drifted through the air as Gervasio then wove me a tale of such heart-wrenching misery that I could barely stand to hear it. “That they would seek to sacrifice their <em>princesses</em> in such a manner!” I gasped. I could only imagine that had the situation been reversed, my mother might have gladly sent me through the country gate, not caring what torment awaited me.</p><p>She would see soon, though. When I became aub, she would acknowledge all my brilliance and hard work.</p><p>I cleared my thoughts of my mother and asked, “But is that really the only way for Lanzenave to survive? Is there nothing else to be done?”</p><p>Gervasio seemed to weigh me for a moment before he said, “Perhaps, if only there were a way for our people to live here where people with mana are not reviled or dependent on the sacrifices of children.”</p><p>My heart broke at the raw pain in his eyes. I wasn’t used to seeing such emotion on a grown man, so I had no defense against it.</p><p>“I’m sure the zent will listen,” I said. “How could he not? We’d benefit just as much as you since we so badly need the mana. Right, Lord Lucius?”</p><p>His smile was a little strained as he nodded. “Right as ever, Lady Detlinde. Of course, I know you would never share such information about our country with any outsiders other than Lord Gervasio. You’re much too clever for that.”</p><p>“Of course,” I agreed. This man might have been from the temple, but he understood my worth. It would only be a matter of time before my mother saw it, too.</p><p>“Lady Detlinde,” my fiancé said, taking my hand in the most audacious manner, “I wish to play gewinnen and have a man-to-man chat with Lord Gervasio. I’m afraid it will quite bore you. You do not have to stay if you so wish. I know your time is exceedingly valuable.”</p><p>I smiled at him. “Thank you, Lord Lucius. Yes, I shall take my leave. If you’ll excuse me.”</p><p>When I got back to my chambers, Karoline came forward and asked permission to speak. I was in a good mood, and I didn’t want to ruin it by listening to her ramblings, but I decided to be magnanimous.</p><p>“My lady,” she said, “I have compared the number of baptismal documents over the past several seasons. They have increased significantly in the past couple of months.”</p><p>“Have they?” I asked, wondering why she was bringing this up.</p><p>“Yes, my lady. On a more troubling note…” She glanced around and then passed me a sound-blocking tool. This was a rarity. I turned and gave her my full attention.</p><p>“My lady, the increase in baptismal documents correlates with the arrival of ships from Lanzenave.”</p><p>I frowned at her. “What does that mean?”</p><p>She pulled her mouth into a tight line. She always did that when I asked her to explain something. It must have been difficult for her to speak to someone of my superior level. “For the past several months, when a Lanzenave ship arrives, the number of baptismal documents you have to sign increases.”</p><p>“That’s odd.”</p><p>“Indeed, my lady. That is not the only strange thing.”</p><p>“There’s more?”</p><p>“Indeed, my lady. Do you recall the food going to the Lanzenave estate decreased even though there were no ships to take anyone back?”</p><p>I didn’t, but I nodded for her to continue.</p><p>She sighed and pushed up her glasses. They didn’t look good on her, but she refused my requests to remove them. “When a ship comes in, the amount of food we send to the estate increases.”</p><p>“Of course,” I said. “There are more people. There’s nothing strange about that.”</p><p>“Yes, my lady,” she said. “However, even when there is not a ship, the amount of food decreases whenever the number of baptismal certificates you have to sign increases.”</p><p>My mind was too hazy to put together what she was trying to say. “Karoline, speak plainly. I’m not sure what you’re implying.”</p><p>With another sigh, she asked permission to use my cosmetics as an illustrative example. I granted it if only so I would have something to watch while she lectured me.</p><p>“My lady, this spot on the left will be the Lanzenave estate. This bottle of rinsham will be a Lanzenave ship. This spot on the right will be your office. Now a ship comes in.” She put the bottle in the middle between the “estate” and “office.” “The amount of food that goes to the estate,” she held up three small compacts of powder, “goes up.” She set them down on the villa spot.</p><p>“Why do you think that is?”</p><p>I fought the urge to roll my eyes. “Because there are more people there.”</p><p>“Yes, my lady. Clever as always.” I sat a little straighter, my chest puffing out slightly. “Now, when the ship leaves,” she picked up the bottle of rinsham, “the people leave with it, right?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“So what happens to the food going to the estate?”</p><p>“We’d stop sending it.”</p><p>“Precisely, my lady.” She removed the compacts. “Now, a ship comes in, the amount of food we send goes up. The ship leaves. The amount of food we send stays the same. What does that mean?”</p><p>I frowned at the compacts she’d sat on the estate. “That there are still people there.”</p><p>She nodded. “But there shouldn’t be people still there, right?”</p><p>“Of course not. They should be on the ship.”</p><p>“That is correct. So the ship remains gone. The next week, the food we send decreases.” She removed a compact. “What does that mean?”</p><p>“That there are fewer people.”</p><p>“Yes. But how did they leave if there was no ship?”</p><p>That made me frown again. “I’m not sure.”</p><p>“Well, right after the food decreases, the amount of baptismal certificates you sign increases.” She placed the compact on the office spot. “The next week, we send even less food.” She picked up the second compact. “And then the number of certificates increases again.” She set it down on the office spot.</p><p>I gasped in realization. “The Lanzenave people aren’t returning home! They’re being baptized in Ahrensbach!”</p><p>“No one can fool you, my lady,” Karoline said. “You are as clever as they come.”</p><p>“Naturally,” I laughed. “They couldn’t slip this past me!” I looked at the compacts on my table and narrowed my eyes. “The temple is the one who baptizes nobles, is it not?”</p><p>Karoline nodded. “Yes, my lady.”</p><p>My eyes widened in realization. “And Lord Lucius was part of the temple! He’s part of this! That was why he seemed so friendly with Lord Gervasio and wanted to speak with him privately!” I paused. “He did want to speak with him privately, right? I’m afraid my memories are not the clearest…”</p><p>“It seemed he asked you to leave, yes,” Karoline said, “though I cannot say for certain since you were under a sound-blocking barrier. It could have been that–”</p><p>I waved for her to stop talking as I pulled out an ordonnanz.</p><p>“My lady, what are you–”</p><p>“Mother,” I said, “I have discovered something I must speak with you about. When can we meet?”</p><p>The reply was slow, but she eventually responded. “I can meet you for tea in my room in three days.”</p><p>My heart soared. Finally, <em>finally</em> I had something that my mother would have no choice but to praise me for! I’d uncovered a plot between Lanzenave and the temple! She would be so proud! She would smile at me and tell me how brilliant I was. Finally, she would give me the attention I deserved!</p><p> </p><p>My mother looked as apathetic as always when I arrived and sat across from her to enjoy our tea time. Soon, however, she would be filled with warm smiles and warmer words of praise.</p><p>I chatted with her about all the work I was doing - completing paperwork, greeting envoys, meeting with Letizia to show her the work of a future aub. She only nodded along placidly but said little.</p><p>Eventually, she called for a change of tea, and the sound barrier went up. “What is it you’ve come to discuss, Detlinde?”</p><p>
<em>Ah, she used my name! She’s listening to me and taking me seriously!</em>
</p><p>“Mother, I have uncovered a wicked plot between the temple and Lanzenave.”</p><p>She froze for a moment before she smiled at me. “Is that so? Tell me more.”</p><p>My heart filled with the joy of my mother’s recognition, I told her all about Lucius’s devious plans that I’d uncovered. “So you see,” I said, “they’ve been baptizing people from Lanzenave as Ahrensbach citizens.”</p><p>“I see,” she said, nodding along. “Oh, my, I was so absorbed that my tea has gone cold.” She smiled at her attendant who nodded and brought out a fresh pot.</p><p>
<em>Mother never smiles when she talks with me! She’s about to acknowledge me! For the first time ever, she’s going to smile at me and tell me, “Well done!”</em>
</p><p>After our tea was poured, Mother lifted her cup and asked, “However did you uncover this, Detlinde? It must have been quite difficult work.”</p><p>I beamed. “Well, first I noticed that the food we were sending to the Lanzenave estate didn’t seem to match when they were supposed to be arriving and leaving.” I began to detail all the little inconsistencies Karoline helped me uncover.</p><p>When I finished, my mother nodded. “I see. You must have put your most competent aides on this. Who could you trust with such an important task?”</p><p>“Well, I figured out most of it,” I said, not wanting to share my mother’s admiration with anyone else, “but Karoline did help a little bit.”</p><p>“Ah.” My mother sat back and stared at me, and I waited eagerly for her to smile at me the way she had at her attendant.</p><p>When she didn’t say anything, I pouted at her. “Moth….er….?” My head began to pound as my vision started to swim.</p><p>
<em>What’s wrong with me? I slept enough last night. Have I been working too hard? Am I falling ill?</em>
</p><p>My throat suddenly became parched, and I reached for my tea only to find my cup empty. The attendant hadn’t bothered to refill it. My mother handed over her tea cup, still untouched, and I tried to drink it, but my lips were numb, so it spilled down my chin and into my lap.</p><p>“Seltier,” Mother said, “has Lucius finally finished dying the foundation?”</p><p><em>What…? Why would</em> he <em>be…?</em></p><p>“Yes, my lady.”</p><p>“Good. We’re going to need to move fast. Get Detlinde’s retainers before they talk to anyone. The graduation ceremony is next week. We’ll be ready by then, yes?”</p><p>I didn’t hear her attendant’s response. My head fell back, and as my vision dimmed, my mother looked at me and clicked her tongue in disgust.</p><p>“Of all times to show any competence, you choose now. You’ve always been a disappointment, Detlinde.”</p><p>
<em>No, Mother, please. Please smile at me.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Please…</em>
</p><p>
<em>I just want you to notice me.</em>

<p>“I’ll prepare the transportation circle from Kirberger to Ehrenfest,” Sylvester said as he slipped his mask over his face. “Once the gate’s open, I’m going to the foundation.”</p><p>Ferdinand nodded and started giving out orders, first to Karstedt to defend the South Gate and then to Florencia and Charlotte who would take separate wings of the castle. This would also prove a test for Natalie who would be acting not only as Charlotte’s guard knight but also future Second Lady. Wilfried would go to the North Gate, the Strike Team to the East Gate, and Melchior to the West Gate. Ferdinand and Rozemyne would meet the Dunkeleger reinforcements at the country gate. Half of the borrowed knights would fill in where necessary while the other half would go with Bonifatius to the border provinces.</p><p>“Philine, Muriella, Laurenz!” Rozemyne called as Ferdinand laid out his plans. “Go to the temple. Make sure the gray-robed priests and the orphans have been evacuated as planned. Aid in the temple’s defense if necessary. Also, tell Damuel to protect what’s most important to me. He’ll know what you mean. I won’t risk alerting the enemy to your location by sending ordonnanzes, so I’ll wait for you to contact me. We’ll be outside of the duchy for a time, though, so you’ll have to wait a bit longer if it doesn’t fly. Understood?”</p><p>“Yes, my lady,” the three of them responded.</p><p>“Melchior’s guard knights should currently be at the temple,” Wilfried said, “so everyone should be safe. Even once they go to the West Gate, there will still be other knights stationed there, so it’ll be fine.” He crossed his arms and muttered, “Not to mention the traps and Hartmut…”</p><p>“Hartmut’s not a knight,” Rozemyne said.</p><p>“Doesn’t mean he’s not a fighter,” Wilfried countered. “Pretty sure he’d attack anyone who threatened you or what you care about, even Father. Besides, the enemy won’t be expecting any priests to have schtappes, so he’ll have the element of surprise going for him.”</p><p>“I’m more worried about the border, honestly,” Charlotte said, cupping her cheek. “If the enemy is already nearing the capital, then what state must our southern provinces be in?”</p><p>“Enough,” Ferdinand said. “Focus on your assigned tasks. Let us depart.”</p><p>He and Rozemyne teleported back to the castle just behind Sylvester and Karstedt and followed them to the training grounds, all four sending ordonnanzes to summon any attendants or scholars not actively engaged in the defense of the castle. Ferdinand and Rozemyne also ordered Eckhart, Cornelius, and Leonore to go learn what they could of their current situation.</p><p>They arrived to find about a dozen attendants along with most of Rozemyne’s adult retainers waiting for them with more highbeasts visible on the horizon. When Justus had told Ferdinand the tale of Rozemyne’s daring gambit in the previous weave, he’d said Sylvester had used the power of several knights in addition to the attendants and scholars to activate the large transfer circle. This time, however, they had to rely on the unoccupied non-combatants alone.</p><p>As Sylvester prepared the circle, Ferdinand sent an ordonnanz to Giebe Kirnberger explaining the situation.</p><p><em>“Understood, Knight Commander,”</em> came the reply. <em>“We will be awaiting your arrival.”</em></p><p>As Sylvester finished the circle and beckoned them to step on it, Rozemyne called, “Wait! Let me offer a blessing first.”</p><p>As much as Ferdinand wanted to stop her, he knew it would only be a waste of time to protest. Instead, he kept a blank expression as he watched her waste her mana on attendants and scholars who wouldn’t see battle.</p><p>Once all those present had nearly every blessing imaginable, Ferdinand, Rozemyne, Sylvester, and their retainers stepped onto the circle.</p><p>“Father,” Rozemyne said to Karstedt, who was staying behind to go take up his assigned post, “you will protect my heart, won’t you?”</p><p>Karstedt’s expression softened. “Of course, Rozemyne. No harm shall come to that you hold most dear.” That had been the exact reason Ferdinand had assigned him to guard the South Gate. He and Damuel were two of the very few knights who knew of her true family and would thus be able to keep them safe.</p><p>“Alright, no more time to lose. Let’s go,” Sylvester said before raising his hand, calling all the gathered to activate the large transfer circle. “Nenlussel Kirnberger.”</p><p>After the colorful waves of mana subsided, Giebe Kirnberger stepped forward and said, “Welcome, Aub Ehrenfest, Knight Commander.”</p><p>They had arrived in the giebe’s summer home.</p><p>“Alright,” Sylvester addressed his retainers, “prepare to activate the circle again. We’ll be going back to Ehrenfest as soon as I open the border gate.”</p><p>“Allow me to lead the way,” Giebe Kirnberger said.</p><p>True to his word, the moment he opened the border gate, Sylvester turned to leave. He paused, however, and passed Ferdinand a sound-blocking tool. After taking a deep breath, he said, “I don’t know when I’ll see you again, so…” He ground his teeth for a moment before placing a hand on Ferdinand’s shoulder. “Come back safe, and remember I support you no matter what.”</p><p>Nodding, Ferdinand swallowed before he replied, “Yes, take care. Remember to wear your mask. You may be stronger than Georgine, but that won’t matter in the slightest if she poisons you.”</p><p>Sylvester’s mouth pulled into a grim line. “Yeah, but I think I’ll be the safest one out of all of us. She can’t make it to the foundation without the key, and it’s still locked up in Rozemyne’s hidden room.” With a sigh, he scratched the back of his head. “Just…be as careful as you can. I would like for all of us to make it out of this alive.”</p><p>“I will. Now go.”</p><p>“Right, right.” Sylvester took back his sound-blocking tool, said goodbye to Rozemyne, and then returned to Ehrenfest.</p><p>After seeing his brother off, Ferdinand went to Giebe Kirnberger, passed him a sound-blocking tool, and said, “This is to remain strictly confidential.” When the man swore silence on his schtappe, he continued, “The future zent will be activating the country gate to send reinforcements from Dunkelfelger. Rozemyne and I are tasked with greeting them. Everyone else must stay back lest harm befall them. Do you understand?”</p><p>The giebe stared at him slack jawed for several long moments before he managed to mutter, “Understood.” After passing back the tool, he turned to his people and urged them to retreat towards his summer home. With that distraction in place, Ferdinand called Rozemyne over along with both of their name sworn retainers and guided them up to the top of the country gate.</p><p>He sent a glare to his three retainers and said, “You are not to speak a word of what you witness here.” Rozemyne did the same, and all of them stiffened before giving their acknowledgment. “Very well,” he said. With a nod to Rozemyne, they both called forth their Wisdom.</p><p>All present gasped in astonishment. “Wh-when…?” Roderick stammered.</p><p>“A question for later,” Rozemyne answered as she placed her book next to Ferdinand’s on the transfer circle. While he disliked letting her give her mana to fill the country gate, he acknowledged that not only had he also spent a fair amount of mana in the past day, but she had a healthy body in this weave and could afford to take more potions if necessary. Besides, they didn’t have a decent excuse for taking Ahrensbach’s foundation, so it wasn’t like she needed to save any mana for dyeing it.</p><p>He gave a rueful smile once the gate was filled. That tree got not only his true zent but enough mana to sustain the country for another couple of decades in a single night. That would hopefully keep the former god and that petty goddess off his back until his thread ran out.</p><p>A horrible thought suddenly seized him. Rozemyne would most certainly at some point take the oath to Mestionora so she would have access to the goddess’s library. That meant Ferdinand would either ascend the towering staircase, never to see his love again, or he would spend eternity under that petty goddess’s thumb.</p><p>Both prospects seemed akin to hell.</p><p>He banished the thought from his mind and returned to the task at hand just as the transfer circle activated. Moments later, they stood atop Dunkelfelger’s country gate. Rozemyne placed her book against the wall and opened the roof, allowing them to fly out of the top on their highbeasts. Before them, the border gate was creaking open. The aub burst through the gap between the doors, followed closely by Heisshitze and dozens of knights Ferdinand immediately recognized from the ditter field.</p><p>“FERDINAND!” Aub Dunkelfelger called before alighting on the country gate. “You arrived faster than Stiefebrise! I’d say you’d never guess what we discovered after you were dismissed, but well…” He pulled up his mask and winked. “And what’s this I see? Metal swords hanging from the belts of your guard knights? I’d ask how you knew, but I suppose you’ve been gearing up for a conflict with Ahrensbach for some time now.”</p><p>Ferdinand said nothing, instead flicking his gaze over the knights that were streaming in, tallying them up until the fiftieth landed.</p><p>“As stoic as ever,” the aub laughed. “Very well. I shall let you pretend to have your secrets. For now.” With a slap on Ferdinand’s shoulder, he proclaimed, “First, we must defend Ehrenfest! I’m afraid my mana is rather drained after everything that’s transpired, so I’m afraid I can offer little assistance with the transfer.”</p><p>“We will take it from here,” Rozemyne said. “We thank you ever so much for your support.”</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger nodded and waved them off as they teleported back to Ehrenfest.</p><p>Upon their arrival, Ferdinand divided the knights into groups as planned and then had everyone activate the transfer circle back to the capital. Bonifatius was there to greet them at the training grounds.</p><p>“Rozemyne, my cute granddaughter!” he cried. “Look at you in your armor! Are you sure you should be fighting…? No, of course you should! No one is as amazing as my granddaughter! You will obliterate the enemy before you!” He gave a booming laugh and then collected himself. “Ah, forgive me. These must be the knights of Dunkelfelger.”</p><p>“Yes,” Ferdinand said. “What’s the situation at the border?”</p><p>Bonifatius crossed his arms and frowned. “Gerlach and Ilgner are both fending off attacks.”</p><p>Ferdinand waved Heisshitze forward. “Heisshitze and his group shall accompany you to the border. Divide them as you see fit between the two provinces,” he said, causing his self-proclaimed rival to gasp with despair.</p><p>“Lord Ferdinand!” he cried. “Will I not be fighting alongside you?!”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Another knight patted the dejected man on the back.</p><p>“Very well!” Bonifatius boomed. “Mount up, knights! Let’s see if you can keep up with me!”</p><p>That lit a fire under the Dunkelfelgers assigned to him, and in the blink of an eye, they were speeding off towards the southern border.</p><p>Just then, an ordonnanz arrived. “<em>Lord Ferdinand,</em>” came Eckhart’s voice from the white bird, “<em>there are attacks on all four gates, though the enemy is most numerous at the West Gate, followed by the North Gate. Several among them are wearing silver.</em>”</p><p>“<em>Knight Commander,</em>” a second report immediately on the heels of the first came from Cornelius, “<em>about half of the enemy forces at the East Gate suddenly collapsed. Fighting nearly came to a halt for several moments due to the confusion. I’m sending the Strike Team to capture as many of the enemy as possible. At least half of the remaining ones are wearing silver cloaks.</em>”</p><p>“<em>Knight Commander, this is Matthias. About half of the enemy forces have climbed the towering staircase at the West Gate. A third of those remaining have silver cloaks.</em>”</p><p>“<em>This is Leonore. A quarter of our attackers at the North Gate have suddenly fallen. The majority of those remaining are wearing silver clothing. The soldiers are proving instrumental in helping to fight off and capture them.</em>”</p><p>A wicked grin darkened Ferdinand’s face. The good news was three fold - the most concerning threat against Ehrenfest’s foundation had gone to the distant heights, the enemy numbers had dropped significantly along with their morale, and they’d brought a reason to take Ahrensbach’s foundation to his doorstep. He quickly dispatched their remaining reinforcements to assist at the North and West Gates before giving Justus a message to send to Aub Dunkelfelger via magic letter.</p><p>Rozemyne, meanwhile, seemed less pleased, staring intently at the sky as she waited for an ordonnanz from the temple. Just as the letter to Aub Dunkelfelger took flight, a white bird landed on her outstretched arm.</p><p>“<em>Lady Rozemyne, this is Philine,</em>” it said. “<em>We have successfully finished evacuating everyone to Lord Ferdinand’s estate. There was a minor struggle at the temple, but it appears to have ended now. Hartmut will contact you with more details.</em>”</p><p>As the ordonnanz was repeating itself, a second alighted on her arm.</p><p>“<em>Lady Rozemyne!”</em> Hartmut’s voice called. “<em>What a joy it is to hear that you have returned to Ehrenfest ahead of schedule! Truly, my heart is moved to know you are near once again!</em></p><p><em>“But do allow me to give my report. The</em> former<em> First Wife of Ahrensbach has gone to meet the Divine Couple. It is worth mentioning that there was also a double parading around as her, but Damuel took care of her as well.</em></p><p>
<em>“My lady, as much as I would welcome your holy presence, the temple is not clean enough to be graced by our esteemed goddess. I must ask you to refrain from visiting until it is up to standard once again.”</em>
</p><p>Justus couldn’t hold back his laughter while Janrik gaped at the bird as it repeated its message. Gretia and Roderick were shocked into silence, and Rozemye’s Leisegang retainers took a dark pleasure in the news.</p><p>“This is why Damuel is my head guard knight,” Rozemyne said, puffing out her chest with pride.</p><p>Ferdinand made a mental note to offer Damuel a reward of some kind as he prepared to go join the fighting. “Rozemyne,” he said as he summoned his highbeast, “go to my estate to check on the orphans and rest. You will need your strength for later.”</p><p>“Wait!” she protested. “I’m an archduke candidate! I have a duty to protect Ehrenfest! Let me go to the South Gate!”</p><p>He frowned at her before he called her to join him behind his highbeast and passed her a sound-blocking tool. “Rozemyne, we now have a reason to take our playground. However, after being placed in schtappe-sealing cuffs last night, filling a border gate, and giving so many blessings, you do not have the strength to steal the foundation. Take this opportunity to rest while you can. Once we settle things here, we will move on Ahrensbach, and I will be largely relying on you since I will not have time to recuperate.” It wasn’t the complete truth, but it would do until he could get her into a hidden room for a longer conversation.</p><p>Her expression told him she was aware he had held something back, but she nodded regardless. “Fine. I understand. I’ll take Janrik and Justus with me. Promise you’ll come back in one piece, though.”</p><p>With Cornelius gone and his highbeast between them and their retainers, Ferdinand seized the opportunity to reach out and take some of her dark hair between his fingers. “I promise,” he said.</p><p>She turned the most endearing shade of Geduldh’s noble color, but she still caught his hand between her own, her eyes never leaving his. “I’ll be waiting for you.” His ears warmed under her intense gaze, and he found himself loath to look away from her. She truly was breathtaking.</p><p>After a long moment, they released each other, and she called their attendants and scholars over to enter her horrendous highbeast.</p><p>Suspiciously, Justus wasn’t nearly as excited as Ferdinand expected him to be. It was as though his curiosity about the monstrosity had already been sated. Ferdinand made a note to have a thorough discussion with his attendant later.</p><p>Once his fiancée was safely on her way away from the battlefield, Ferdinand nodded to Judithe, and they flew towards the West Gate.</p>

<p>“Lady Rozemyne will be returning to the temple next week,” Hartmut said to Fran as he cast his gaze over the High Bishop’s chambers. “I trust you will have everything in order by then.”</p><p>“Of course, High Priest,” the gray robe said.</p><p>Naturally. One would expect nothing less of an attendant selected by his mistress and her Dark God. He could have simply told him Lady Rozemyne’s date of arrival and left him to it without any oversight, but he would never miss the chance to come into her chambers and soak in the vestiges of her presence.</p><p>The room still faintly smelled of her rinsham. Truly, it was a wonder to be among her things, surrounded by her fragrance, and know that she would yet again grace the very floors he inspected.</p><p>He suspected Fran knew his true motives behind his near-daily visits in the lead up to their lady’s arrival. Of course, he would expect as much from the man who had served Lady Rozemyne since her commoner days.</p><p>Would that he could tell his mistress that he was privy to her secrets. Alas, until she accepted his name, he could do no such thing lest her Dark God strike him down where he stood. Those children of criminals from the former Veronica faction could give her their names and be surrounded in her glorious mana at all times, and yet he was denied.</p><p>Well, if all it took was the imminent threat of punishment by association, he could perhaps have his father framed for something or the other. The man had committed enough unscrupulous acts that a little treason might be believable. Then again, trapping one as wily as his father would prove nigh impossible.</p><p>Such was the conclusion he’d come to on a regular basis whenever he began considering ways to become name sworn to his one and only lady.</p><p>What a cruel way in which Ventuchte wove! That she would allow others the privilege of being name sworn for the merit of being spawns of miscreants yet deny him the same despite his undying devotion! Would that those entitled whelps came to the temple more so that he might vent his frustration!</p><p>“I assume you have plenty of her preferred blend of…” Hartmut trailed off as the door latch clicked. He spun just as Fran froze in place at the sight of an uninvited guest pushing open the door.</p><p>Hartmut pulled his schtappe, but the moment he saw silver, he grabbed his dagger as well. Fran immediately bolted for his side room as soon as he saw the intruder produce a schtappe as well. That the man was able to act rather than remain frozen in fear caused Hartmut some chagrin, but he put it out of his mind for the time being.</p><p>The first mana attack landed square in Fran’s back. It would have been fatal, but Lady Rozemyne took no half measures in protecting her people. One of his four charms activated, reflecting the blow at three times the strength. It knocked the intruder back, but it appeared to cause no damage. The force of it blew back her hood enough to reveal purplish blue hair and snarling red lips.</p><p>“Oh, hello,” Hartmut greeted Lady Georgine with a smile. “Are you here for the key to the foundation?”</p><p>That brought her up short for a moment, allowing him to shoot a beam at her exposed face. She blocked it with her arm, however, and countered.</p><p>That activated Hartmut’s charm, and he frowned in displeasure. That had been filled with Lady Rozemyne’s mana! She would absolutely refuse to refill it for him, and wearing it against his skin, feeling the exquisite pain it brought, was as close as he could get to the euphoria being her name sworn would have surely provided him.</p><p>And this woman had taken one of his lady’s three charms from him!</p><p>Hartmut began fighting her in earnest, approaching her as he threw attacks that she easily blocked with her silver robe and countering the ones she sent in reply. Just before he got within stabbing distance, she thrust a silver tube at him. It exploded into a puff of powder that sent him into a coughing fit as his second charm activated.</p><p>“Hmm… It didn’t work,” she muttered as she began to walk past him. “Why is there a noble in the temple to begin–urk!”</p><p>Georgine looked down at the metal sword protruding from her chest in surprise. Damuel had charged into the room and upon seeing Hartmut on his knees, slipped on his mask and ran the first wife of Ahrensbach through without a moment’s hesitation. One would expect nothing less of a knight who’d served Lady Rozemyne since her commoner days. The lout.</p><p>After casting waschen on Hartmut, Damuel said, “This is the second Lady Georgine I’ve slain.” Frowning down at her body, he muttered, “I think this one is real, though.”</p><p>Slowly, Hartmut got control of himself and then moved to stand over Georgine’s body. With his customary smile, he turned his schtappe into Ewigeliebe’s sword and ran the corpse through, just barely missing her mana organ. He made sure to miss it another four times before he finally pierced it and retrieved the feystone to present to Aub Ehrenfest.</p><p>When he looked up at Damuel, he found the knight facing away from him, his hand covering the lower half of his pale face as if trying not to be sick.</p><p>“Damuel.”</p><p>“Yes?” he asked, still refusing to turn towards him.</p><p>“Give me your charms. The ones for poison and mana attack protection.”</p><p>“...What?”</p><p>Hartmut’s smile vanished. “Give me your charms.”</p><p>Damuel hurriedly removed both pieces and handed them over, his expression equal parts fearful and troubled.</p><p>“Thank you,” Hartmut said as he slipped them on, relishing the increased presence of his mistress’s mana. “Here, you can have these. Would you like me to fill them up for you first?”</p><p>“I…would rather you not,” Damuel muttered.</p><p>“Oh, so you have enough mana to fill them and participate in the battle that is surely brewing outside?”</p><p>With a grimace, Damuel took the charms filled with Hartmut’s mana.</p>

<p>Cleaning up what remained of Georgine’s diversionary forces proved a paltry task. The fools from Lanzenave had clearly devised their entire strategy around deflecting mana attacks. The fact that all Ehrenfest’s knights were armed with metal swords and the soldiers with spears caused them to fall like zantzes before a scythe. The battle came to an end just after fourth bell, and they spent another two bells taking their nearly four dozen captives to holding cells for interrogation and seeing to the bodies of the deceased. Casualties for Ehrenfest were light, consisting mostly of minor injuries.</p><p>Once things were organized enough to let Ferdinand step away, he sent an ordonnanz to Clarissa, who had gone with Bonifatius’s group to act as a point of contact.</p><p><em>”We’ll be wrapping up here soon,”</em> she replied. <em>”Most of the enemy climbed the towering staircase out of nowhere before we arrived. It was a short but fierce battle. We captured some of the people in silver and some Ahrensbach knights, but it seems a giebe or two might have been among those who met the Supreme Couple before we arrived. Lord Bonifatius is collecting their heads as I speak. The land is dead in certain spots from black weapon attacks. Will Lady Rozemyne perhaps be coming to restore it? If so, I shall diligently wait for my lady’s arrival.”</em></p><p>Ferdinand frowned at the little bird as it repeated its message then sent back, “Rozemyne will not be performing any rituals today. Once you have finished, return to the castle immediately for a debrief.”</p><p>He then sent a second ordonnanz to inform Sylvester the fighting was over before heading to his estate. When he entered, he was stopped by one of the most enchanting sights he’d ever beheld. Rozemyne, despite being told to rest, was perched on one of the spring-loaded chairs, holding up a picture book as she read to the orphans who had been evacuated from the temple. Despite controlling her expression like a proper noble, Rozemyne’s face was glowing with joy, accentuating her beauty to a heart-stopping degree.</p><p>Indeed, a mere glance was enough to steal his breath away. How could anyone be so perfectly formed? Seeing how she looked at the children as she read to them stirred something within him, something he couldn’t quite name. She looked motherly, and he couldn’t help but picture the younger girl in the front with dark blue hair and moon-gold eyes.</p><p>Suddenly, a rush of panic threatened to overwhelm him, but he shoved it down <em>hard.</em> He would have to deal with his feelings regarding fatherhood one day but not now. There would be plenty of time for that in the future, perhaps in his hidden room with the woman who would make doing so a necessity. He nearly shuddered at the thought of discussing such dark, twisted thoughts with her. She had accepted him despite his past, but how could he expect her to accept a man who could do nothing but bring harm to her children?</p><p>Again, he shoved the feelings down and turned his focus back to the present. He turned to Justus, who was giving him a knowing look. “Go prepare the library,” he said. The scholar left to do as commanded, Janrik close on his heels to assist.</p><p>Ferdinand then walked over to Rozemyne and placed a hand on her shoulder. She startled and snapped her wide-eyed gaze up to him. For the life of him, he would never understand how she could become so enthralled with a book that she wouldn’t sense his approach, despite their mana becoming clearer to each other by the day.</p><p>“Rozemyne, please come with me to the library.”</p><p>The orphans looked downcast at her departure, but they brightened back up when Philine took the picture book from Rozemyne to pick up where she left off.</p><p>Ferdinand escorted her into the library, and the moment the door closed, Rozemyne ordered her retainers to turn around. Cornelius began to protest, but Matthias grabbed him by the arm and bodily spun him around. “Give it up,” he said, “unless you want to see something you’d rather not.”</p><p>That brought a small smile to Ferdinand’s face. It was always gratifying to see a plan come to fruition. To Ferdinand’s shock, however, Justus, Janrik, and even Eckhart had followed her orders as well. He hadn’t so much as glanced at them for confirmation.</p><p>He didn’t have long to contemplate it as once Rozemyne set up a sound-blocking barrier, she slammed into him, holding him in a hug that made him wince. “I was so worried!” she said. “If Lieseleta hadn’t used that charm on me, I never would have been able to sleep! I’m so glad you’re okay! Now that it’s over, I’m sure I’ll be able to sleep better. How’s my fam– How is everyone?!”</p><p>The sleep comment bothered him, but he would address it with her later when they had a little more time. “They’re fine,” he assured her. “Damuel and Karstedt saw to it personally. Gunther fought well.”</p><p>“Of course he did!” she chirped, puffing up with pride. “He’s one of my people, after all!”</p><p>As she talked, Ferdinand took a piece of misplaced hair and tucked it back behind her ear, peeling back the glove of his feystone armor so he could feel its silky texture. She flushed bright red, and her gaze was so intense that he had to look away lest her beauty and his post-battle high drive him to do something he would regret. “We can continue this later,” he said. “We have another battle to plan for.”</p><p>Her expression stiffened and then relaxed into her noble smile. She dropped the barrier and allowed everyone to face them again. “Justus,” Ferdinand said, “did you receive any replies?”</p><p>“Yes, my lord.” Ferdinand had him send a letter to King Trauerqual and Aub Dunkelfelger explaining that there were Lanzenave fighters amongst the Ahrensbach knights, that a large number of them were using Lanzenave equipment, and that black weapons had been used against Ehrenfest’s land.</p><p>Justus handed him the letters, which he quickly read.</p><p>
<em>Lord Ferdinand,</em>
</p><p>
<em>Ahrensbach’s treachery cannot be overlooked. Given Ehrenfest’s unique history, you fully understand the ramifications of allying with outsiders to move against Yurgenschmidt. Therefore, you are uniquely poised to act as the Zent’s shield and defend our country from these foreign invaders.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I also understand the Saint of Ehrenfest’s desire to save as many lives as possible. The aub’s family will be executed along with the families of any conspirators. However, if you are able to identify citizens who have not turned traitor, you may spare them.</em>
</p><p>
<em>You are permitted to do what is necessary to protect Yurgenschmidt and Ehrenfest.</em>
</p><p>
<em>–King Trauerqual</em>
</p><p>It seemed even he had stopped referring to himself as zent. Everything from the past day must have weighed heavily on him. Ferdinand couldn’t fathom why else the king would give a man such as himself such free reign.</p><p>Then again, Ahrensbach was doomed at this point regardless. He could level the entire duchy, and he’d only be doing the royal family a favor.</p><p>Next, he read the reply from Aub Dunkelfelger.</p><p>
<em>Ferdinand,</em>
</p><p>
<em>A real ditter, you say? Of course, Dunkelfelger will participate! Ah, would that I could come myself! I shall send another twenty-five knights to support you. I wish I could send more, but there is much to defend. Simply let us know when you’ll be ready to receive them.</em>
</p><p>
<em>—Aub Dunkelfelger </em>
</p><p>When he finished, he passed both letters to Rozemyne. Her eyes grew wider and wider with each line, but she managed to gain control of her expression when she finished them. “So when are we going to Ahrensbach?” she asked.</p><p>If Ferdinand didn’t know her so well, he wouldn’t have caught the anxiety tugging at the corners of her eyes and altering the timbre of her voice. “When the date changes,” Ferdinand said. “Everyone needs to rest and recuperate from today’s battle and last night’s events. For now, though, we will have lunch and then go to the castle for the official debrief. Your chefs were brought here on your return, no?”</p><p>Rozemyne nodded. “Let’s send the gray priestesses who have been helping in the kitchen at the orphanage as well.”</p><p>It had been a couple of years since Ferdinand’s chef had cooked with divine gifts in mind, but it seemed to be a habit he picked back up with ease. The estate didn’t have the capacity to feed all the orphans at once, however, so they had to set up temporary tables as they’d done in Hasse’s monastery so the orphans could all eat at the same time once it was their turn.</p><p>As they were finishing their meal, an ordonnanz came from Hartmut informing them that the temple had finally been cleansed, so everyone was welcome to return. Once again, Philine, Muriella, and Laurenz led everyone back to the orphanage. As much as Rozemyne wanted to join them to check on her attendants and the young blue robes, she had to prioritize meeting with the aub.</p><p>When they arrived at Sylvester’s office, Hartmut and Damuel were there to greet their lady. Apparently, they had been summoned to discuss the battle in the temple.</p><p>After everyone took their seats, Sylvester said, “Alright. Bonifatius, start us off.”</p><p>“Reprehensible!” he bellowed. “To use black weapons in such a manner…! They stabbed them into the very earth! I could not believe my eyes!</p><p>“The battle, though, was easy enough. The people in silver fought as though they expected to simply walk across the border and defeat us by merely poking us with their weapons or throwing powder in our faces. We did manage to capture a few. The knights from Dunkelfelger fought as valiantly as you would expect.</p><p>“We got most of them, but some fled back across the border.”</p><p>Sylvester nodded and turned to Ferdinand, but his expression changed as he muttered, “Nah, save you for last.” Instead, he had the knights stationed at the border gates give their accounts, much of it matching what Ferdinand was already told. Karstedt avoided talking about Rozemyne’s family directly, but he mentioned everything in the southern part of the city was safe. Wilfried’s report mostly remained concise as one would expect from a knight commander, but he did venture into heroics a bit towards the end. Melchior relied heavily on his head guard knight to discuss what had happened at the West Gate.</p><p>When it came for Florencia’s turn, she placed a hand on her cheek and said, “My apologies, but nothing happened where I was. I imagine nearly everyone was stopped at the gates.”</p><p>“What about you, Charlotte?”</p><p>The girl nodded. “Lady Georgine infiltrated the castle from a secret passage the best I can guess. I was able to capture her, but it seems she was not the real one after all. She’s being held with the other prisoners.”</p><p>Sylvester sighed and shook his head. “How in the world does someone make copies of themselves? It makes no sense.” When his eyes met Ferdinand’s, however, he gave a small shudder and said, “You know what? I’m better off not knowing. Now, then, Hartmut, I assume you at least stored Lady Georgine’s head somewhere safe?”</p><p>The scholar’s eyes tightened slightly as he gave a deep bow. “My sincerest apologies, but all I have to present to you is her feystone.”</p><p>A cold, stunned silence fell over the room. Eventually, Sylvester broke it with, “So you mean to tell me that we won’t be able to read her memories?”</p><p>“That is correct.”</p><p>“Care to explain why she’s a feystone instead of a headless corpse?”</p><p>“After Damuel slew her, I stabbed her again to ensure she was actually dead, and my blade managed to nick her mana organ. Forgive me, but as a scholar, I have little experience with this sort of fighting, and the stress made my strike less precise than I would have preferred.”</p><p>It was difficult to tell if Hartmut was being honest or not given the thickness of his noble mask. Sylvester evidently thought the same as he turned his weighty gaze on Damuel, who straightened his back and gulped.</p><p>“I was doing rounds at the temple when I sensed a small burst of mana and heard something strange. I went to the source to discover a look-a-like of Lady Georgine holding out her ringed hand towards one of the young blue priests. He was injured, though not severely. She was wearing silver clothes, which explained why I couldn’t sense her but not why she was using a ring instead of a schtappe. I sent her to the distant heights, told the priest to lock himself in his room, and ran to the High Bishop’s chambers to report to Hartmut.”</p><p>“Wait,” Rozemyne said, “why was he in my chambers?”</p><p>Ferdinand crossed his arms, also interested in the answer.</p><p>“To personally check on the preparations for your return to the temple,” Hartmut answered. “I must ensure everything is up to standard beforehand.”</p><p>Ferdinand glared at him, not at all satisfied with that response. The man, however, wasn’t cowed in the slightest, likely meaning what he said was partially true. Ferdinand could well imagine why he needed to “personally” inspect her chambers, though, and he intended to have a long conversation with the High Priest about his antics.</p><p>At Sylvester’s wave, Damuel continued, “Not only was the Lady Georgine Hartmut was fighting using a schtappe, the mana she used in her attacks was at least what I would expect from an archnoble. I slew her while she was distracted by Hartmut.” His gaze traveled to the floor as he said, “It is as Hartmut said after that. He produced a sword and stabbed her to ensure she was dead.”</p><p>“Damuel,” Ferdinand said, his tone dropping into his knight commander register, “did you not learn your lesson from the trombe incident?”</p><p>That sent a shiver through the knight. “I-I did. I… perhaps did not mention that he stabbed her a number of times.” Under Ferdinand’s harsh glare, he added, “With Ewigeliebe’s sword.”</p><p>A tense silence fell over the room as all eyes turned to Hartmut, who stiffened but otherwise didn’t react to the harsh glares. After a moment, Wilfried said, “He probably formed that sword out of habit after being in the temple so long. I had to consciously think about forming a normal sword for a full year before I stopped summoning Ewigeliebe’s sword since I was so familiar with it.”</p><p>“That doesn’t change the fact that beheading her would have ensured she was dead and allowed us to search her memories,” Ferdinand replied.</p><p>“I offer my deepest apologies,” Hartmut said as he dipped into a bow. “However, as I am unfamiliar with participating in combat, my instincts are not so honed as to think so clearly in the midst of battle or its immediate aftermath.”</p><p>“I see,” Bonifatius said. “It wasn’t enough to train the scholars to respond appropriately during an attack. I shall take it upon myself to train all the scholars of the archduke family so they will have proper battle instincts!”</p><p>As Hartmut, Roderick, and the rest of the scholars in the room paled, Ferdinand smirked inwardly. “Yes, that would be most appreciated.” He could think of no better punishment. It helped that his own scholar, Justus, had survived direct training from Ferdinand and would thus not suffer unduly under Bonifatius’s instruction.</p><p>Hartmut gave Rozemyne a pleading look, but she shrugged as if to say, <em>You brought this on yourself. Deal with it.</em> To Roderick, however, she gave a pitying smile. The knights in the room offered similar looks of empathy.</p><p>After Georgine’s feystone was presented to Sylvester, he exchanged a look with his brother and dismissed everyone else, save for Rozemyne. “Alright,” he said after activating a sound-blocking barrier and relaxing back in his seat, “what do you two have planned next?”</p><p>“We’re going to Ahrensbach,” Ferdinand said. “We will close the country gate and do what is necessary to protect Yurgenschmidt and Ehrenfest while saving as many lives as possible, per King Traurequal’s orders.”</p><p>Sylvester heaved a sigh and ran a hand through his hair. “I was afraid of that. We can’t really afford to lose you two and your entourages, but I suppose we were going to one way or another. I doubt even Aub Dunkelfelger would allow you to stay here since you both have the Grutrissheit. When are you leaving?”</p><p>“When the date changes.”</p><p>He sighed again and looked despondently at Ferdinand. “Yeah, okay. Just… be careful. Take care of each other.”</p><p>“We will,” Rozemyne said with a determined nod. “I won’t let any harm come to Ferdinand!”</p><p>With a frown, Ferdinand pinched her not-so-soft cheek. “Just who should be protecting whom, hm?” he demanded.</p><p>“We woo wodeh ee udah!”</p><p>“What nonsense is this mouth trying to spout, huh?”</p><p>“Wee gooooo! Huuuws!”</p><p>Ferdinand released her, and she glared balefully at him as she rubbed her cheek. “I said we should protect each other! I’m strong, too, you know! I’ve been training under Grandfather ever since I woke up from my jureve!”</p><p>While that was true, he didn’t want her to step between him and an enemy attack again like she did with that tree in the previous weave. That very determination to protect him was what had first imbued her with a goddess’s mana and started the journey to her premature ascent to the distant heights. He couldn’t lose her again, nor could he stand to relive another weave and wait another seven or eight years to be with the woman he loved.</p><p>“Rozemyne, you’re worried about the temple, aren’t you? Why don’t you go check on everyone and then rest there,” he said.</p><p>The glint in her eyes suggested she understood what he was telling her. “Fine, but you have to go to your estate to rest, too, so no one can disturb you!” She gave a pointed look to Sylvester, who raised his hands in defense.</p><p>“Hey,” he protested, “even I know where to draw the line, kid. Now, get out of here. Your retainers need rest, too. Karstedt and I will take care of the interrogations.”</p><p>Once Ferdinand was back at his estate, he told Justus, Janrik, and Eckhart to rest, announcing he would do the same in his hidden room so no one would feel the need to stand guard over him.</p><p>“Shall I prepare a bath first, my lord?” Justus asked.</p><p>“No,” Ferdinand said as he marched to his office. “A waschen will suffice.” With that, he went into his hidden room and shut the door. He paced the length of it for an eternity before the transportation circle began to glow.</p><p>The moment she appeared, Rozemyne barreled into him, gripping the back of his robes as she clung to him. He wrapped his arms around her, stroking her soft, lustrous hair as he whispered her name.</p><p>“I was so worried,” she said, her breath seeping through the front of his robes and spreading warmth across his chest that quickly dissipated. “And now we have another battle ahead of us.”</p><p>“Yes, we need to discuss that,” Ferdinand said, already dreading the coming argument. “But first…” Leading her over to his bench, he pulled her into his lap and gathered her in a hug as he said, “Good job on coming first in class once again, Rozemyne. Ehrenfest could not ask for a better archduke candidate. You are my pride and joy.” It wasn’t exactly the hug he received from his father, but it was the hug they’d shared since she was a small child. He would have to reserve it for offering her this praise, however. She was far too beautiful and far too close to adulthood to allow this to continue.</p><p>Rozemyne tucked her head into his shoulder, her warm breath ghosting across his neck and making him immediately regret their current position. With effort, he turned his thoughts to what had transpired in the past two days as well as the coming battle to regain his composure.</p><p>After spending a moment playing with the ends of her hair, he asked, “How are you doing after what happened?”</p><p>“You mean after being kidnapped?” she asked. “Surprisingly well, all things considered, but that may be the adrenaline talking. I never had any doubt that Matthias would find you and you’d save me. With all the charms you’ve given me, I didn’t have to worry about being harmed, either, even with my mana dropping so low. Basically, I was never in any real danger. I was worried about my retainers, though. I would have held a bloody carnival if they’d hurt any of them.”</p><p>Ferdinand’s arms tightened around her, a dull panic washing over him once again. “Rozemyne,” he whispered, pressing his cheek against the top of her head, “do you understand how close you were to being taken from me?”</p><p>She huffed a little as she said, “Do you understand how far they were from being able to actually capture me? All of my name sworn have that amulet, and even if they somehow noticed Matthias going missing, it’s not like they could have done anything about it.”</p><p>“They could have killed you the moment they noticed your entourage had shrunk by one.”</p><p>“They wanted my information too much,” she said.</p><p>Strangely, her words brought him some comfort. It was true - the moment Matthias told him where she was, not even the gods could have stopped him from getting to her. If she always had a foolproof exit plan ready to go, it was no wonder she was so confident.</p><p>Of course, her plan would only work if they wanted to interrogate her. Although if they wanted her dead, they’d have to go through all of her protective charms.</p><p>That brought to mind something else. “Rozemyne, I have something for you.” As he was loath to let her go, he simply leaned over, stretching as far as he could to grasp the box he needed. When he finally had it in his hand, his attention was drawn back down by Rozemyne’s giggle. His short-sighted move had caused him to bring her with him as he leaned across his bench, leaving her lying below him, her legs thrown over his and her body pressed against him. With her hair draped over the side of the bench and her eyes filled with Geduldh’s passion, his mind blanked, and his mouth went dry. The light blush on her cheeks only served to enhance the mind-numbing look of longing in her eyes.</p><p><em>How can you be so gorgeous?</em> he thought.</p><p>Her smile widened, and her cheeks flushed deeper as she replied, “I often think the same when I look at you.”</p><p>Good gods, had he said that out loud?!</p><p>She giggled again at his obvious horror before reaching up and tucking his hair behind his ear. “You’re so handsome it’s like Kunstzeal molded you herself.”</p><p>He was well aware of the fact that he was attractive, so why did her voicing it make his ears burn? Stating the obvious should not have had such a strong effect on him, and yet his heart thundered in his chest and his thoughts became muddled.</p><p>That was perhaps why he found himself lowering his face towards hers. A small smile pulled at her glistening lips as her moon-gold eyes fluttered closed, causing her long, dark eyelashes to fan across her cheeks. When he felt her breath against his lips, he froze.</p><p><em>Despite how she looks and carries herself, she is not an adult,</em> he reminded himself. It didn’t matter that she had the memories of an adult woman from another world. Gaining memories of the previous weave did not make her that Rozemyne, so recovering memories from a previous life did not make her the woman she once was, either. This Rozemyne was her own person, and she was only fourteen, still two seasons away from when she would have started tying her hair up had she remained Myne.</p><p>He himself would be turning twenty-eight this spring. He was a man well into his autumn compared to this girl merely on the cusp of it. The words she’d spoken to him not so long ago rang through his foggy mind.</p><p>
<em>Didn’t you kind of manipulate me into it, though? I was nine.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I was really emotionally vulnerable.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Doesn’t that seem a little…</em>
</p><p>If he gave into his baser desires now, he’d only be repeating his mistake. Regardless of what memories she did or didn’t have, he still had a responsibility as the older party to maintain his composure and protect his young fiancée while she was yet in her summer.</p><p>Before he succumbed to temptation, he leaned forward and placed a gentle kiss on her forehead. Even that act sent an uncomfortable warmth through him, convincing him he’d made the right choice. He didn’t know what he would do if he came in contact with those mana-covered lips.</p><p>When her eyes fluttered back open, they were filled with barely-veiled disappointment.</p><p>“You’re still in your summer,” he said.</p><p>She sighed and gave him an exasperated look. “I’ll actually be fifteen this summer, you know.”</p><p>“Which is quite a ways away.”</p><p>“It’s just a kiss, Ferdinand.”</p><p><em>Will it be, though?</em> he wanted to protest, but he didn’t want to risk scaring her by revealing that side of himself. Instead, he said, “You deserve better than a bench in my workshop.”</p><p>With another huff, she muttered, “It’s not like it’s inviting winter for the first time.”</p><p>Ferdinand closed his eyes and drew every magic circle he could think of in his mind to erase the images that statement spawned. Good gods, had she not even considered the position they were in when she said that?</p><p>“Fine,” he said. “Then <em>I</em> deserve better than a bench in my workshop.”</p><p>“Bwuh?!” she blurted, releasing all the tension that was building in him with a single syllable. “You haven’t kissed anyone before?”</p><p>He furrowed his brows at her. “And just who do you suppose I would have been so intimate with?”</p><p>“I just thought… I don’t know. You were engaged once, weren’t you?”</p><p>“Yes, to a woman who compared me to an ice sculpture,” he said. “That aside, why suffer through the discomfort of feeling someone else’s incompatible mana when I cared nothing for the women around me or what they offered? Any one of them could have been a spy or assassin sent by Veronica. That is negligible reward for a mountain of risk.”</p><p>Rozemyne stared at him as though in a daze. “Oh. Sorry. I really just thought… I mean, I don’t really have any experience with this myself, but guys in the dream world were always…”</p><p>Ferdinand closed his eyes and sighed as he remembered that highly inappropriate story she’d written when she was only eight. No wonder her mind had been filled with such filth if men were so openly depraved in her old world. Even the priests at the temple kept their dealings behind closed doors.</p><p>“Are you unsatisfied?” he asked, keeping his eyes closed.</p><p>She tilted her head. “With what?”</p><p>“With… me. With my… lack of experience.”</p><p>“What?” she asked, giggling lightly. “Of course not! I like that I’ll be the only one who’s kissed Ferdinand.”</p><p>He could understand her feelings. Knowing he would be the only one to touch his Rozemyne gave him a rather primal sense of satisfaction. One that he couldn’t dwell on too long lest it overtake him.</p><p>At last, he sat upright and guided Rozemyne to sit beside him. “We need to talk about the upcoming battle, and to that end, here.” He passed her the box he’d grabbed, and she opened it to reveal the feystone-adorned mana chain he’d made for her in the previous weave to block Mestionora from taking her over. This time, however, he made it so it would repel all the gods. He’d be damned if he let them lead her to her death again, and he dared anyone to say anything about it. They could accuse him of covering a child in ice, but after the kidnapping incident, the attack on Ehrenfest, and now the raid on Ahrensbach, those with the gall to protest would understand why he needed to give her all the protection he could. There was never any telling what trouble this gremlin would find herself in.</p><p>“It’s beautiful,” she whispered. After a moment, she added, “But won’t people, um, have something to say about this if I wear it?”</p><p>“Perhaps, but wear it you must,” he said. “You need to be protected from the gods.”</p><p>“Come again?”</p><p>With a sigh, he rubbed at his temple and wished he’d gotten more sleep before having this conversation. “It’s related to the previous weave… specifically how you died.” Her eyes widened, but she remained silent as she waited for him to explain.</p><p>And so he did. He told her how they had fought the Lanzenave forces who had kidnapped high-manaed girls and women and attacked those who supported him and Letizia to harvest their feystones. He told her of how she developed a crippling fear of feystones with something she called post battle stress. He told her of Gervasio and his misguided plot to take the country’s foundation, how they were summoned before the tree, how she had protected him from the former god and nearly ascended the towering staircase only to have Mestionora take over her body and dye her mana, causing her to lose some of her most important memories. Then, he explained how when she’d gone back to Erwaermen when they set up Eglantine as zent, he’d foolishly asked the gods to trample over her. He told her how Mestionora had to take her over again to try to settle the excess godly mana in her body, and finally, how they tried to expend it all so Ferdinand could redye her only for him to fail her.</p><p>At some point during the story, Rozemyne had taken his hand and offered reassuring squeezes throughout. By the end, her head was resting against his shoulder while her free hand played with the mana chain. When he finished the story, she let the silence breathe for a while before she said, “It must have been so hard. You did well, Ferdinand.”</p><p>Ferdinand gritted his teeth as he fought back the wave of unexpected emotion that crashed over him. How he longed to crumple into her and cry like he wasn’t allowed to as a child. Instead, he did as he always had done and swallowed his pain. They simply didn’t have time for such childish antics at the moment.</p><p>“So you understand why you must wear it now?” he asked her.</p><p>Rozemyne nodded.</p><p>“And why you shouldn’t go into battle?”</p><p>Her mouth pulled into a tight line. “I will have to take the foundation either way, though, right? The adopted son may be down there defending it.”</p><p>“You forget that I can go with you this time. Allow me to clear the way.”</p><p>“Then they’ll ask you to take the foundation from me since I’m underaged, right? If I can say I fought for it and won it in ditter, then there’s a greater chance they’ll let it stand.”</p><p>He glared at her, unable to refute her logic. Even so, it was far from a guarantee.</p><p>Well, regardless, he planned to fully abuse the leeway King Trauerqual had given him to gain what he desired - a place where he and Rozemyne could be with their family.</p><p>“I understand, though,” she said. “I’d be a useless aub if I can’t even look at feystones, and since there’s no cure for [*&amp;!%], it’d be with me for the rest of my life. There’s no [$%#] therapy here, either, so learning to be functional again might prove even more difficult than it would in the dream world. Since the other Rozemyne developed it, there’s a good chance I will, too.” She looked down and mumbled under her breath, “Maybe I already have it with all these nightmares.”</p><p>Ferdinand tightened his grip on her hand. “What do you mean ‘nightmares’?”</p><p>She looked startled for a moment and then closed her eyes with resignation. “I still have recurring nightmares from the previous weave, and I still don’t know which Rozemyne I am when I wake up sometimes.”</p><p>“Why didn’t you say anything?” he demanded.</p><p>“Um… Because I thought you already knew?”</p><p>Ferdinand ran his free hand down his face, aghast at this horrendous oversight. He’d thought telling her she’d successfully saved him had taken care of the issue. How foolish could he be? “There has to be something we can do to help you determine you’re this Rozemyne upon waking.”</p><p>“I have an idea,” she ventured, her gaze sliding to the side, “but I don’t think you’ll like it.”</p><p>She’d been suffering alone for so long, and he’d been completely oblivious. He didn’t care what the solution was, as long as there was one. “Tell me.”</p><p>“Take my name.”</p><p>He froze, his mind going blank.</p><p>Rozemyne gave a small sigh and said, “I told you you wouldn’t like it. It’s just… If I’m pretty sure if I feel your mana around me when I wake up, I’ll know instantly that… that you’re alive. If you’re alive, then I’m me, not her. I know she saved you in the previous weave, but the memories I have to see night after night don’t go that far, so I’m always reliving the moment you nearly died.”</p><p>“Have you talked to your name sworn about giving me your name?”</p><p>“Yes, a while back, actually. Muriella swooned so hard she almost died. I’m certain there’s a story about it in the works.”</p><p>Squeezing her hand, he tucked a lock of her hair behind her ear and cupped her cheek as he looked into her eyes. “I would be honored to take your name, Myne.”</p><p>She gasped, and then tears began glistening in her eyes. Covering the hand holding her face with her own, she gave him a smile as she said, “Thank you, Ferdinand. Will you accept it once this battle is over?”</p><p>He nodded, and once again, the vision of her lips threatened to overwhelm him, so he instead placed a second kiss on her forehead. A shiver ran through Rozemyne, and he froze. He was certain he hadn’t poured any of his mana into her, but the look on her face said otherwise.</p><p>Turning away before Brenwarmme’s heat drove him to madness, he said, “We should rest. We have a long night ahead of us, and we don’t have much time left.”</p><p>Gently, Rozemyne brushed her fingers against his cheek and turned him to face her. Her breath-taking face was still full of wintery promise.</p><p>For a moment, he began to doubt whether he should take her name or not since she was absolutely going to send him to the distant heights. The next two years were going to be hell, and he sincerely worried he wouldn’t survive until their starknot.</p><p>There was a fine line between medicine and poison, and Rozemyne was steadily tipping towards the latter.</p><p>Unfortunately, Ferdinand was far too willing to drink it down.</p><p>His agony only increased when she pressed her moistened lips to his forehead, letting a tantalizing wisp of mana caress him.</p><p>Thank the gods for heavy robes.</p><p>“Sweet dreams, Ferdinand.” With that, she pranced over to the teleportation circle and vanished, wearing the most enticing smile he’d ever witnessed.</p><p>Holding his head, he let out a long, slow sigh as the fires of Brenwarmme scorched him.</p><p>Well, he was going to have to waschen himself anyway.</p>

<p>When Ferdinand woke, the God of Darkness’ cape was just stretching across the sky. Schlaftraum fought to keep him in his realm, but he forced himself to sit up and summon the Book of Mestionora.</p><p>“Let’s see what you were planning this time, Georgine,” Ferdinand muttered as he went to her entry.</p><p>Shock shook him to his core as he read the account of her life in Ehrenfest. Her upbringing had far more in common with his than Sylvester’s. He’d thought Veronica would dote on her blood, but it seemed she only cared for her son. It was tragic, really. With what he knew of Georgine, she would have made an excellent aub with the right upbringing, and Sylvester would have been much happier following in Bonifatius’s footsteps. How sad that Veronica’s cruelty extended not just to the bastard she hated but to the children she claimed to love.</p><p>Shaking his head free from the memories that resurfaced, he turned to later entries. She made contact with Raublut in the same way as before, but this time she taught him the body double technique after losing her name sworn in Ehrenfest. When he fled the Sovereignty with the key to the Adalgisa palace, she allowed him to hide in Ahrensbach.</p><p>That was just about the only plan of hers that had worked out. Losing her name sworn had been a heavy blow, and being unable to take Rozemyne and Ferdinand off the gewinnen board hindered her even more. That was aside from losing the extra income she needed to fund her invasion when Lady Sieglinde negotiated to have import taxes waived for Dunkelfelger and Ehrenfest.</p><p>Since she could no longer rely on the extra funds to purchase feystones and unbaptized noble children, she needed to broker another deal to get what she needed. Fortunately, one of the Lanzenave envoys, Leonzio, was more than receptive. If she could find a way to provide himself and his allies with schtappes, they would gladly fight with her so long as they were allowed to keep the feystones. He even offered to kill her political enemies within Ahrensbach. In the meantime, they would provide her with silver cloth, poison, and trug in exchange for a handful of Devouring girls with enough mana to be consumed before their baptisms. She had planned to use them to make copies of herself, but she considered it a small price to pay.</p><p>The problem with getting Lanzenave nobles schtappes was activating the transportation circle to Adalgisa. As she was considering her options, Raublut approached her with a request to speak with his master. Gervasio wanted to find a way to bring the people from his faction to Yurgenschmidt, which granted her an excellent opportunity. She agreed to adopt his son to be the next Aub Ahrensbach and grant citizenship to any of their people who wished to stay. In exchange, Francesco - now Lucius - would marry Detlinde, but he could relegate her to third wife if he wished. He would, of course, have to be trained in dyeing feystones, one of which Georgine would pass off to Raublut to use to open the way to the Adalgisa once Lucius became aub.</p><p>Detlinde, however, managed to stumble across the plot somehow and brought it up to her mother, who promptly killed her.</p><p>At least she saved Ferdinand the trouble.</p><p>Unfortunately, Georgine was only loosely aware of the plans following the conquest of Ehrenfest. The Lanzenave nobles with Leonzio were supposed to return to Ahrensbach to receive their schtappes at some point and continue their feystone hunt after, but there was no mention as to when that was supposed to occur. She assumed the Academy would be on lockdown after discovering Prince Sigiswald’s death, so she wasn’t sure when they would actually be able to enter. It didn’t matter to her if the Lanzenaves were delayed in retrieving their schtappes. She’d have achieved what she needed - removing Ferdinand and Rozemyne from the equation.</p><p>Given the rumors floating around, she knew that Ferdinand would be frantically searching for Rozemyne, who would be locked in a hidden room with no chance of escape. Even if Sylvester managed to return, she would merely need to poison him.</p><p>While she devised the plan to get Sigiswald’s feystone, that was a mere byproduct of her true purpose. Therefore, she didn’t bother to find out what the Lanzenaves planned to do once they got their schtappes. She didn’t even know what Lucius and Gervasio had planned for Ahrensbach, nor did she care.</p><p>With a sigh, he dismissed the book and immediately set to work packing up all the magic tools and potions he thought he would need before exiting his hidden room. Lasfam met him on the other side of the door and took the box from his master. “Aub Ehrenfest asked for you to come as soon as you were able.”</p><p>After ordering Justus to finish packing, Ferdinand flew to the castle and made his way to the aub’s office. Upon his arrival, Sylvester immediately cleared the room and turned on the sound-blocking tool. “You won’t believe this,” he said.</p><p>“Is it about Lanzenave nobles becoming Ahrensbach citizens?”</p><p>“Wait! How’d you know?!”</p><p>“The Book of Mestionora.”</p><p>Sylvester groaned and held his head in his hands. “If you could just look it up, why did I bother reading so many memories today? Do you know how messed up some of those people were?”</p><p>“There wasn’t any specific information about their plans after the invasion of Ehrenfest.” He gave his brother a brief overview of what he found regarding Ahrensbach’s current situation. “Were you able to discover anything new during the interrogations?”</p><p>“Hold on,” Sylvester said, throwing up a hand as he held his forehead. “Back up a moment. Georgine killed her own daughter? Seriously?!”</p><p>Ferdinand shrugged. “I don’t think she ever cared much for the girl.”</p><p>“Maybe not, but still… Gods, just how far was she willing to let her obsession take her? Who did she expect would inherit Ehrenfest after her if she had no heirs?”</p><p>“It’s entirely possible she wasn’t planning on there being anything to inherit.”</p><p>Sighing, Sylvester leaned back on his chair. “Yeah, could be.” After a moment, he leaned forward and said, “Alright, about the interrogations. The giebes were here to steal mana from our lands to take back to theirs. As for the Lanzenaves, they were going to go to the Sovereignty to get schtappes this evening in two groups. After the first left, the other one was planning to slaughter any nobles outside of Georgine’s faction to take their feystones. They would kidnap any women or girls with high mana to take back to Lanzenave.</p><p>“At no point did the new Aub Ahrensbach play into this, and from what you said, it seems this was all planned behind his back. I’ll need to contact him with the water mirror, and I want you with me when I do.”</p><p>Ferdinand tapped his temple as he considered their options. Lucius was both Aub Ahrensbach and from Lanzenave. While it seemed he might not have been privy to the deal with Leonzio, that didn’t mean he wouldn’t join his side. He had come as part of an agreement to let Lanzenaves become citizens of Ahrensbach, but that deal had been struck with his father, not him.</p><p>And where was Gervasio for all this? Raublut hadn’t learned how to get the Grutrissheit in this weave, so it was almost a certainty that they wouldn’t be trying to take the country’s foundation. Even if they decided to, they would have to fight Aub Dunkelfelger for it, but if they made a play for it that evening, it would be troublesome. Gervasio had a lot of mana and could pose a genuine threat, and Aub Dunkelfelger had all but exhausted his mana and couldn’t take any more potions.</p><p>With that possibility, if he were going to follow King Trauerqual’s orders to protect Yurgenschmidt, Ferdinand would need to make his move soon. Regardless of orders, however, they couldn’t storm into Ahrensbach unannounced. Even if Lucius was acting against the duchy, contacting him first wouldn’t change much. The glowing gate would alert him to their presence, so surprise was never an option to begin with.</p><p>“Before we contact the aub,” Ferdinand said, “I would like to request permission to take the strike team to Ahrensbach as well.”</p><p>Sylvester snorted. “Like I can deny you. The zent basically gave you free rein to do what you want so long as it serves to protect our duchy and the country. You know, I’m glad he’s not long for the throne. Anyone dumb enough to give you that much license has no business running a country.”</p><p>“And just what do you mean by that, dear brother?” Ferdinand asked with a saccharine smile.</p><p>“I mean exactly what I said. Why do you think you’re the only one able to rein in Rozemyne? It’s because you’re just as much of a gremlin as she is!”</p><p>Ferdinand scoffed. “I’m no such thing.”</p><p>Leveling a flat look at his little brother, Sylvester intoned, “You played a ditter with the country’s future on the line and set up a new zent last night.”</p><p>“That was to save Rozemyne.”</p><p>“Pretty sure you would have sent a prince up the towering staircase, too, if he hadn’t already climbed it.”</p><p>Ferdinand remained silent.</p><p>“Yeah, you see?” Sylvester said, waving a hand at him. “Gremlin. My whole house is full of them. Gods, at least Melchior is normal. I mean, he will be. He’ll grow out of his sister-worshipping stage soon, right?”</p><p>“Of course,” Ferdinand said with a smirk, “around the same time Hartmut stops worshiping her.”</p><p>“That damned fanatic,” Sylvester sighed. “I swear, I would send him to the distant heights if we didn’t have other sources of information and he weren’t so essential to Rozemyne.”</p><p>“Yes,” Ferdinand agreed. “I’ll need to have a talk with him later. Regardless, I don’t perceive the Lanzenave forces being too much of a threat if they fight like they did here this morning. We may need to go earlier than planned, though.” Ahrensbach was already suffering from a mana drought, and Ferdinand didn’t want to lose any more of Letizia’s, and perhaps Lucius’s, supporters than they likely already had. They didn’t want the duchy bordering them to be mostly comprised of Georgine supporters when she was killed in a failed attempt to invade Ehrenfest. Besides, many of the targets were decent workers.</p><p>“Alright,” Sylvester said, “Let’s go contact Aub Ahrensbach.”</p><p>“Wait,” Ferdinand said. “I want Rozemyne present.”</p><p>“Huh? Why?”</p><p>“Multiple reasons,” he replied. “First, as a holder of the Grutrissheit, she’ll be traveling with me through the country gate. As such, she’ll be fighting alongside the rest of us, and she’ll need to be apprised of the situation. She’s also the best negotiator this duchy has.” Truthfully, though, he knew Rozemyne would want to be present so she could learn about the current situation in Ahrensbach and determine if she would need - or want - to take its foundation. He was certain she would decide not to, but it was her decision to make, and she’d probably never forgive him if he’d had the opportunity to let her talk to Aub Ahrensbach beforehand but didn’t take it.</p><p>With a sigh, Sylvester said, “My gut tells me there’s more to it, but fine. Summon her. We need to do this as soon as possible.”</p><p>It wasn’t long before Rozemyne joined them, and Ferdinand and Sylvester gave her a summary of what was found during the interrogations and in the Book of Mestionora. “So the attack could already be underway,” she said. “We should hurry.”</p><p>With a nod, Sylvester led them into the room with the mirror. As they waited, Sylvester gave Ferdinand an odd look. “Why are you all the way over there?”</p><p>“It would be better for him not to see me at first.”</p><p>Sylvester narrowed his eyes at him, but Rozemyne waved him off. “Just leave it. There’s no helping it when he gets stubborn like this.”</p><p>Ferdinand frowned at that, but he frowned harder when his brother sighed and said, “Yeah, you’re right.”</p><p>Before he could protest, the new Aub Ahrensbach appeared. Both Sylvester and Rozemyne reacted with surprise. The former cast a troubled glance his way, confirming Ferdinand’s suspicions that they shared more than a passing resemblance with each other.</p><p>“Greetings, Aub Ehrenfest,” the man’s voice echoed throughout the small chamber. “Forgive me for my abruptness, but this is a precarious time for my duchy. What may I do for you?”</p><p>His upper-duchy-aub persona fully in place, Sylvester looked down at the mirror and said, “I am at least partially aware of your situation. The former first wife of Ahrensbach, Lady Georgine, led an assault against my duchy earlier this morning.”</p><p>“<em>What?!</em>”</p><p>Sylvester raised a brow. “You seem surprised by this news.”</p><p>“<em>Of course</em> I’m surprised!” Lucius cried, proving his year in Yurgenschmidt masquerading as a temple-raised noble was not enough to train him to control his emotions. “She was supposedly locked away in her chambers to mourn for the past week, not orchestrating an attack on our neighboring duchy.”</p><p>Sylvester narrowed his eyes, pretending to be oblivious. “If it has only been a week, I assume this wasn’t the loss of her husband she was mourning since you have already dyed the foundation.”</p><p>“No,” Lucius sighed with exasperation. “Lady Detlinde was assass– sent up the towering staircase.”</p><p>“I am sorry to hear it. My deepest condolences on the loss of your fiancée, Aub Ahrensbach,” Sylvester said with a respectful bow of his head. “Is that perhaps how you didn’t notice the absence of the two giebes she brought with her to Ehrenfest to attack our land with black weapons or the dozens of Lanzenave and Ahrensbach nobles she used to assault our city in an attempt to steal our foundation?”</p><p>Silence filled the chamber as Sylvester waited patiently for a reply.</p><p>Eventually, Lucius said in a wavering voice, “The Lanzenave numbers declined whenever a boat left. It’s possible they were moving to the border instead of boarding the ships, I suppose. As for the giebes, winter socializing is almost over, and sometimes giebes leave before the feast celebrating spring, especially those whose provinces are on the outskirts, or so I was told.”</p><p>“So you are claiming you had no part in the attack on my duchy?”</p><p>“Of course I didn’t,” Lucius protested. “I’m not sure if you’ve been to our shared border lately, but Ahrensbach is struggling to provide mana for the land it already has. It would be the height of foolishness to attempt to conquer more. We already lost one of our very few suppliers last week. Tell me, is Lady Georgine still alive? Forgive my rudeness, but if so, I would ask that you return her as a political prisoner so we might put her in the Ivory Tower. I simply cannot afford to lose another supplier.”</p><p>Sylvester allowed a grimace to show. “Unfortunately, she went to the distant heights during the battle.”</p><p>After a drawn out, regretful sigh, Lucius muttered, “Of course. This family was nothing but fools to the very last. So, Aub Ehrenfest, did you contact me to ask for reparations or to let me know I’m about to fight a war on two fronts?”</p><p>Sylvester shook his head. “Neither, but by that statement, it seems you already know what our interrogations revealed. The Lanzenaves who attacked us were planning to return to Ahrensbach and kill Lady Georgine’s political opponents for their feystones and kidnap the high-manaed women and girls.”</p><p>Lucius’s mumbled curse might not have been heard in person, but the water mirror amplified his voice. “Yes, it is as you say. They are attacking my people as I speak, which is why I must ask this conversation to be as brief as possible.”</p><p>Ferdinand raised his brow at that and signaled to Sylvester. His older brother nodded and stepped to the side to make room for him. The moment his face came into view, Lucius froze, his mouth agape.</p><p>“Aub Ahrensbach,” Ferdinand said, “I am the Ehrenfest Knight Commander, Ferdinand. Let me start by asking this - is there anyone else in the room with you?”</p><p>It took a moment for the man to respond, but he shook his head. “No, I’m alone.”</p><p>“Good. Allow me to acquiesce to your request for brevity. I know your true origins and who your father is, so when you say ‘your people’ are under attack, I am unsure of which people you refer to. So which is it - Lanzenave or Ahrensbach? Your answer will greatly influence what aid you can expect to receive.”</p><p>Lucius grimaced as he held his head in his hands. “Damn it all.” After a moment, he looked back up and gave Ferdinand a determined glare. “Do I have your word that if I answer you truthfully, you’ll actually send help?”</p><p>“Again, it depends on what that truth reveals.”</p><p>Rozemyne stepped forward then and gave a polite nod of her head. “Excuse me, Aub Ahrensbach. I am Rozemyne, archduke candidate of Ehrenfest and fiancée to Knight Commander Ferdinand.”</p><p>“Ah, the Saint of Ehrenfest,” Lucius intoned. “Do you have the whole damn duchy in the room with you?”</p><p>She gave him an embarrassed smile. “No, it’s just us three. Forgive me for staying to the side until now. We are prepared to give aid to the people of Yurgenschmidt. Traitors and those outsiders seeking to harm the good people of Ahrensbach are our enemy, and we are willing to do what is necessary to protect our country. Will we be aiding you in defending Ahrensbach, or will you side with your fellow Lanzenaves?”</p><p>Lucius’s eyes hardened at her words. “I am Aub Ahrensbach. Lanzenave is no longer my home. I originally came here to give refuge to those of my faction who wanted to move to Yurgenschmidt where people with mana are treated well and live without fear of those who wield anti-magic tools. We also don’t want to perpetuate an ivory city built on the suffering of our daughters and the blood of their children. Those who have come have been granted citizenship here in Ahrensbach, and they, too, are fighting for their lives alongside the native-born.</p><p>“There is another faction within Lanzenave, however, that wants to return to the ‘glory days’ when mana wielders were revered as gods. To that end, they want your zent to receive another of our princesses and to take all the women and feystones they’re gathering back to Lanzenave. They are the ones we’re fighting against.”</p><p>Rozemyne placed a troubled hand on her cheek. “My deepest apologies, but there is something that doesn’t make sense to me. If the people who attacked Ehrenfest and are attacking Ahrensbach belong to this other faction, then it stands to reason Lady Georgine made a deal with them - their help in exchange for mana. However, you’ve failed to say what she gained from allowing you to take the foundation and become aub.”</p><p>“I was to marry her daughter, and I and those who followed were to supply mana to this parched land.”</p><p>She frowned. “She could have found a partner for Lady Detlinde within Yurgenschmidt to fulfill that role without opening her duchy to foreigners. Forgive me, but that doesn’t seem to be a reasonable trade for a woman as careful and cunning as Lady Georgine.”</p><p>Shaking his head, Lucius truly seemed at a loss. “I have extraordinary amounts of mana, so I can only assume she planned to take full advantage of that to try to save Ahrensbach. I doubt there are many here who can match me, and most of the nobles who came with me have archnoble levels of mana.”</p><p>He truly seemed to believe what he said. With a sigh, Ferdinand cut to the chase. “Is it not obvious what she gained?” he asked. “Ahrensbach was in charge of sending princesses from Lanzenave to the Adalgisa palace, meaning there is a transportation portal between the two that can only be activated by the aub.”</p><p>“I haven’t activated any such portal,” Lucius protested.</p><p>“Did you ever fill feystones for her?”</p><p>“Well, of course,” he said. “It was required both as part of my pre-Academy training and for filling the land for Spring Prayer and the like.” Then, he frowned and crossed his arms. “Are you saying it’s possible to use one of them to open the portal?”</p><p>Rozemyne nodded. “You should be more careful who you give your mana to from now on,” she cautioned.</p><p>As Lucius cursed his foolishness, Ferdinand said, “Our interrogations revealed they were planning on obtaining schtappes, and it seems they meant to do so by taking advantage of that portal.”</p><p>“Impossible,” Lucius said. “They would have no means to obtain them. Even I know that a member of the royal family must open the way to the Farthest Hall.”</p><p>Rozemyne exchanged a look with Ferdinand who tapped a finger against his temple. “As we just stated, you merely need to have a feystone with someone’s mana to open a magically sealed door.”</p><p>“So Lady Georgine managed to trick a royal into giving her a feystone?“</p><p>“No,” Rozemyne said, “Prince Sigiswald was sent to the distant heights yesterday.”</p><p>Lucius grew so pale his lips turned white. For a moment, Ferdinand thought he would faint, but the man managed to recover enough to maintain consciousness. “By the gods… The zent must want Ahrensbach to be wiped from the face of Yurgenschmidt. There truly is no hope…”</p><p>“I am under orders from the zent to protect our country and save as many people as possible,” Ferdinand said, trying to stop his descent into despair. “What you have said thus far suggests you are no traitor but are actively fighting against them.”</p><p>Shaking his head again, Lucius asked, “Will the zent show us mercy if we give him Leonzio’s head?”</p><p>Feigning the ignorance he was supposed to have, Ferdinand asked, “Is that their leader?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Then I imagine so.”</p><p>Lucius nodded to himself. “Have I answered your questions satisfactorily enough to earn your aid?”</p><p>“One more question,” Ferdinand said. “Where is your father?”</p><p>Lucius blinked at him in bewilderment before he answered, “Fighting against the invaders. Where else?”</p><p>That set Ferdinand’s head spinning. Where was Raublut, then, if his true master was on the front lines, fighting against those who were trying to obtain schtappes? Was he somehow uninvolved in this part of the plot? Did he only mean to help Gervasio secure a place for his people to settle down in Yurgenschmidt?</p><p>No, that wasn’t right. He would have no need to use trug on the royal family to reach that goal since they only needed an aub to agree to take them in. He was likely still following his original plan - to put Gervasio on the throne. However, he didn’t know how to obtain the Grutrissheit in this weave, so his means to do so would be limited at best. Was it possible they were using Lucius to pave the way and then have Gervasio show his strength in this battle to bolster his own reputation? He would need every ounce of advantage he could eke out if he wanted to set his master up to rule, after all.</p><p>“Very well,” Ferdinand said. “We have fifteen members of an elite strike team, seven archducal guard knights, two archduke candidates, and seventy-five knights of Dunkelfelger ready to come to Ahrensbach’s aid.”</p><p>Lucius closed his eyes and furrowed his brow, overcome with emotion. After a moment, he said, “We thank you ever so much. How long will it take you to arrive?”</p><p>“In my estimation, perhaps a quarter of a bell.”</p><p>That caused his eyes to bulge. “So soon?! How?!”</p><p>“We will travel by the country gate,” Rozemyne said. “Can you ensure the border gate is open for our arrival?”</p><p>“The country gate?” he asked, incredulous. “You have to have the Grutrissheit to… Wait…! You don’t mean…?”</p><p>“Where is the fighting heaviest?” Ferdinand interrupted him. “We should send the bulk of the Dunkelfelger knights there.”</p><p>Lucius held up a hand as he pressed his hand against his brow. “Please wait a moment. Let me get my Knight Commander in here so we can talk logistics. By the gods…”</p><p>The connection cut off as the aub stepped away, leaving them alone with a thick silence.</p><p>“So,” Sylvester said, tucking his hands into his sleeves, “just gonna announce to the whole country you have the Grutrissheit, are you?”</p><p>Rozemyne huffed and said, “Aub Dunkelfelger didn’t have the mana to send us and his knights back, so he made me do it.”</p><p>“In other words,” he said, “if seventy-five knights of Dunkelfelger already know, there’s no point in hiding it. Well, if the future zent okayed it, who am I to disagree?”</p><p>“All aubs used to have their Wisdom once upon a time, you know,” Rozemyne said.</p><p>With a scoff, Sylvester waved a dismissive hand at her. “I can tell you there’s no way I’m going to be able to get it. Ehrenfest will have to wait for Charlotte to get a Gruttrisheit-wielding aub. Good gods, she’s actually going to have to go get her Wisdom now that others know you have yours. No one will stand for me favoring her for aub when you have that advantage over her.”</p><p>“Oh, that won’t be difficult,” she said with a noble smile. “She’s already gotten some of the tablets, so she can finish up the process next school term.”</p><p>With a sigh, Sylvester looked towards the ceiling and muttered, “Only a gremlin would say it’s not difficult to get the Grutrissheit.”</p><p>Before she could snap back, Sylvester turned to Ferdinand and said, “Wilfried’s going to want to come along, too, given he’s the future knight commander.”</p><p>Ferdinand nodded, “Very well. We can add his guard knights to our numbers. I can put him at the head of the strike team, which will free up Cornelius to guard Rozemyne. Wilfried’s been training with them for the past year, so it will be a decent test of his leadership and combat skills.”</p><p>Sylvester opened his mouth to respond, but he paused and shifted his gaze to the mirror. He walked over and activated it. Lucius and Strahl came into view on its surface.</p><p>“Aub Ehrenfest, Knight Commander Ferdinand, Lady Rozemyne, this is Strahl, the knight commander of Ahrensbach. He will be leading the discussions on logistics.”</p><p>As Strahl politely bowed his head, Ferdinand was overcome with a strange sense of nostalgia. Never did he expect to have missed any of his retainers from Ahrensbach. Strahl was a highly competent guard who didn’t deserve to lose his post in the previous weave, and Ferdinand was heartened to see he was spared that humiliation this time. His respect for Lucius went up slightly as he acknowledged the man had accomplished what he himself could not - keeping Detlinde reigned in. Then again, she hadn’t activated the zent selection circle this weave, so Lucius would have had an easier time of it.</p><p>“Greetings,” Ferdinand said. “The number of reinforcements we can bring has increased somewhat since we spoke, Aub Ahrensbach.” He gave both of them the updated numbers and asked, “Where do you need us to go when we arrive?”</p><p>Strahl rubbed at his chin as he said, “Currently, we have three major points of conflict - the castle, the city, and the docks. The fighting is heaviest at the first two, but the problem is that while the castle is easier to secure, the fighting is spread amongst several groups throughout the city. Plus, every time an ordonnanz flies overhead, some of the Lanzenaves peel off to go chase it down. Same story when they see a rott.</p><p>“My vice commander has been updating a map as reports come in, though you’ll understand why those are few and far between. At first, it seemed they were attacking houses at random, but now knowing about Lady Georgine’s actions this morning, a pattern is becoming apparent. Each of the estates that were skipped over in a cluster of attacks belongs to a member of her faction.”</p><p>“Their houses are likely marked in some way,” Ferdinand said.</p><p>Strahl nodded. “Agreed. Once we discover what that mark is, it’ll make it easier to determine who the traitors might be. We don’t want any of them killed. If they try to escape, take them alive for questioning. Priority on the archnobles.</p><p>“That said, I would like half the Dunkelfelger knights to come to the castle and the other half to split themselves into two groups and start on either side of the conflict in the city and work their way to the middle. I will defer to your judgment on which group should take the docks - the strike team or yours. Whichever one isn’t going there should go to the city like the Dunkelfelgers but start on the side opposite the castle and work their way in.</p><p>“Now, most importantly, as I’m sure you were made aware this morning, mana attacks do not work on silver cloth, and they’re all wearing it. Makes it easy to identify them but hard as hell to deal with them. They also have a powdered poison that will kill you as soon as you breathe it in, so you’ll want masks. We need some of them alive for questioning, especially Leonzio, their leader. I haven’t gotten a report on his whereabouts yet, though.”</p><p>Ferdinand nodded. “Very well. Is the border gate closed?”</p><p>Strahl shook his head. “We considered it, but we didn’t want to drive them into a corner. No boats have left the docks yet, I’m assuming because they’re waiting until they’re full first. Probably not planning on making a return trip.”</p><p>“And what of the Lanzenave estate? Has anyone gone to investigate it yet?”</p><p>Strahl sighed and scratched the back of his head. “Just how much does this guy know…? We sent a small contingent there, but the place is empty.”</p><p>“It might not be for long,” Ferdinand cautioned. “You should at least keep eyes on it.”</p><p>Lucius nodded at Strahl’s questioning look. “Understood,” the knight commander said. “When can we expect you?”</p><p>“We will see you in a quarter of a bell,” Ferdinand said before taking Rozemyne’s hand and pulling her away from the mirror. “Contact your people and Wilfried and have them meet at the training grounds as soon as possible,” Ferdinand said. “I’ll send word to the Dunkelfelger knights and strike team.”</p><p>She nodded and immediately got to work.</p><p>Meanwhile, Sylvester had stepped back into view of the mirror, “Aub Ahrensbach, Ehrenfest is delighted to be able to aid the duchy who formerly gave us asylum. We can discuss everything else after the threat of Lanzenave has been eliminated.” He cut off the connection and turned to Ferdinand and Rozemyne. “Alright, I’ll send an ordonnanz to Giebe Kirnberger to let him know to expect us. Let’s head for the training grounds.”</p>

<p>After a dozen rewrites and brainstorming session with maskedquerade, I finally finished this chapter.</p><p>Seriously, this thing gets harder to write with each ensuing chapter.

<p>When they arrived at the training grounds, all seventy-five Dunkelfelger knights, fifteen strike team members, Rozemyne’s adult and name sworn guards, Wilfried, his guard knights, Eckhart, Justus, Clarissa, and Hartmut awaited them. 112 people total. It would take quite a bit of mana to move them all, but the previous Rozemyne had managed it, and the current one was much stronger. Soon after they arrived, Wilfried, his guard knights, and Charlotte alighted by the transfer circle to Kirnberger.</p><p>Ferdinand stayed astride his highbeast as he hovered in the air just above their heads so everyone could see him. Slipping into his knight commander persona, he addressed them all. “We successfully defended Ehrenfest from the threat the former First Wife of Ahrensbach brought to bear this morning, but we are not finished. By order of the zent, we must do what is necessary to defend Yurgenschmidt. The enemy, foreign invaders from Lanzenave, have set their sights on Ahrensbach. They are slaughtering any nobles they find to harvest their feystones and kidnap any women of sufficient mana to take back to their country.</p><p>“We cannot allow them to take what belongs to Yurgenschmidt to enrich their own lands. Since the civil war, we are not so mana-rich as to be able to turn a blind eye to this, to say it is merely Ahrensbach’s problem. Therefore, you, members of the Zent’s sword, shall join with us, the Zent’s shield, to purge this blight from our lands and restore order. Time is of the essence in this game of speed ditter.</p><p>“Heisshitze, half of your knights will go to the castle. The other half will be split into two groups and enter the city on either side of the conflict and work your way in.</p><p>“Wilfried, you will lead the strike team to the south side of the city and work your way north.</p><p>“Rozemyne, our team will take the docks, stop any ships from returning to Lanzenave, and free the captives. We will lead them to safety and then go into the city to clean up what remains of the enemy.</p><p>“Be wary. They are after nobles, so they will respond to rotts and ordonnanzes with force. Use this to your advantage to draw them out if necessary.</p><p>“Now, let us perform the pre-ditter ritual and offer our mana to the gods.”</p><p>A roar went up from those gathered. When Ferdinand landed, Charlotte approached him. “Uncle, as I am future archduchess of Ehrenfest, I am embarrassed by how little I have contributed. Might I lead the ritual so I can at least contribute my mana?”</p><p>Ferdinand held his chin as he considered his niece. She was famous amongst the Dunkelfelgers for defeating Lestilaut in ditter and destroying their duchy’s treasure in the process. While they would undoubtedly prefer the Saint or Lord of Evil to lead it, allowing the future aub of Ehrenfest, where their princess would one day move, to demonstrate her capabilities was not a bad idea.</p><p>“Very well,” he said, “so long as you use Leidenschaft’s spear.”</p><p>“Is there any other?” she asked, looking exactly like her mother as she gave him a peaceful smile.</p><p>Ferdinand snorted and went to stand by Rozemyne as Charlotte took the lead. She summoned her lance, prompting everyone else - even the two Ehrenfest scholars - to do the same. Justus had observed the ritual several times at the Academy, but Ferdinand wasn’t sure how Hartmut learned it. Perhaps his fanaticism drove him to study religious rituals since his lady had an interest in them.</p><p>“I am the one who offers prayer and gratitude to the gods who have created the world,” Charlotte chanted, and those gathered followed her lead, the sharp sound of over a hundred spears striking the ground echoing through the still night. As she led them in the spear dance, a synergy fell over the group, giving Ferdinand a sense of oneness with everyone. It was a strange, calming sensation, and despite the numbers being similar to when the knights order went to hunt the Lord of Winter, the feeling was amplified. Was it because so many of the knights present had blessings from Leidenschaft’s subordinates, or was it because of the passion of the Dunkelfelgerians? He would have to experiment with it.</p><p>Another roar split the night as the light of blessings rained down on them, increasing their strength and agility and filled them with excitement for the coming battle.</p><p>Charlotte stepped back, and Sylvester joined them as they moved to the transportation circle. “We can’t all fit at once in the giebe’s summer home, so we’ll travel in two groups.” And so they split into groups of fifty-six. This time, only the giebe accompanied them to the gate, and he immediately retreated after.</p><p>“We should go in two groups again,” Rozemyne said. She paused for a moment a bit her lip, a rare public show of nerves for a girl who had all but perfected her noble persona under Elvira’s strict tutelage. “Ferdinand, they’ll see me with the book.”</p><p>“Why are you so concerned?” he asked. “As you stated before, the Dunkelfelger knights already saw you with it.”</p><p>“I’m not talking about them. I’m talking about <em>them</em>.” She gave a slight nod towards Hartmut and Clarissa, who were talking at each other with enraptured looks on their faces, much to the chagrin of those around them.</p><p>“Ah,” he said. “Fear not. I will be having a talk with both of them.”</p><p>She sighed and placed a troubled hand on her cheek. “They’re my retainers, Ferdinand. I’m the one who should correct their behavior.”</p><p>“Oh?” he asked. “And what correction have you offered to prevent Hartmut from going into your chambers at the temple?”</p><p>She grimaced at that. “Give me a break. I just learned about that today. What a hassle… If I can’t get through to them, then I’ll unleash the Lord of Evil on them. Agreed?”</p><p>“Agreed,” he said, pride swelling in him at how strong she had become.</p><p>Ferdinand left her side and explained the plan to everyone. The first group traveling would be those heading for the castle and the west side of the city. The rest would travel in a second group. When they arrived, they were to immediately go to their assigned areas.</p><p>“Wait,” Cornelius said. “Don’t you have to have the Grutrissheit to…?” He trailed off, giving his sister a horrified look.</p><p>Her name sworn looked away guiltily, but Hartmut and Clarissa vibrated with incandescent euphoria. As they opened their mouths to begin their proclamations of worship, Rozemyne shot them a glare and said, “Not one word, or I will leave you behind.”</p><p>They immediately slapped their mouths shut.</p><p>After the first group was transferred, Ferdinand joined everyone on the circle for the second trip. The circle glowed, and when the light faded, the sounds of distant battle echoed around them.</p><p>“Welcome to Ahrensbach,” a familiar voice called out. They looked up through the open roof at Aub Ahrensbach, sitting astride a winged horse. It seemed he chose not to use the heraldic dolphin of his new house. “Now, if you please enter the duchy proper so I can close the border gate behind you.”</p><p>Ferdinand flew up to meet him. “You’ve decided to corner them after all.”</p><p>“They’re probably getting close to filling up at least one of the boats, and I don’t want to lose any more of my people,” he said. “We decided that it wa– What in the hell?!” His mouth hung open as he watched Rozemyne’s large monstrosity of a highbeast approach. Only two of her guard knights and two scholars were inside, but it was packed with magic tools and potions, most of which Ferdinand and Rozemyne had brewed for ditter against Dunkelfelger at one point or the other.</p><p>“By the gods,” the aub breathed. “I heard tale of your highbeast from the professors at the Royal Academy,” he said, “but seeing it in person, I’m afraid they didn’t do it justice. To think you can expand it so far.”</p><p>Rozemyne puffed up with pride. “Yes, Lessy is both functional and cute!”</p><p>With a smile, Lucius said, “Yes, quite cute.”</p><p>Everyone in earshot gave him a disturbed look.</p><p>He seemed unperturbed as he flew down and closed the border gate. Shouting came from the docks, and Ferdinand turned to Rozemyne. “I believe they’re calling for us.”</p><p>“Well, let’s not disappoint them,” she said. Those who had just transferred over flew off towards their destinations to meet with the enemy. As they approached the docks, Rozemyne called, “The boats are plated with silver, so traditional mana attacks won’t work. Come get the hammers!”</p><p>The guard knights came around the back of her highbeast as the large door there popped open, revealing several boxes and a stack of metal cross-peen hammers. The heads were roughly half the size of an anvil with a flat surface on one end and a pointed one on the other, and the shafts were as long as Ferdinand’s arm. When Ferdinand had posed the hypothetical question to the Gutenbergs about how one would go about opening a metal box that was sealed shut without destroying the contents inside, one of them had said, “Couldn’t you just use a crowbar? Barring that, I guess you could hit it really hard on the edges of the lid with the peen of a big hammer a few times.”</p><p>As they waited to get theirs, Angelica looked to Eckhart and asked, “Will Stenluke go through the silver?”</p><p>“He might,” he said. “He went through silver cloth just fine.”</p><p>“Then allow me.”</p><p>Before she could leap off her highbeast and plunge at one of the boats, Eckhart wrapped her in bands of light. “Hold it, darling. We have to get the people off the ship first. We can’t just sink it.”</p><p>“Ah, right. Stenluke, where should I cut?”</p><p>“I apologize, master,” the sword said in Ferdinand’s voice. “This is my first time coming across such a boat, so I am unfamiliar with it and cannot give adequate advice.”</p><p>Ferdinand sighed. “Good gods, Angelica, just focus on the people who are loading the boats.”</p><p>Eckhart released Angelica, and she came down in the middle of the scrabbling enemy on the dock, crushing one of them underneath her. Ferdinand fired paralytic poison at the men charging towards the docks from the beach. Though it was a stronger formula, it was still weak enough that some of them would survive. Probably.</p><p>“Angelica!” Eckhart called. “Try not to damage their clothes! They could be useful later!”</p><p>“What about blood?” she yelled back as she punched one of them in the face, sending him careening into the sea. “...And water?”</p><p>“It’d be best to avoid both, but only if you’re able.”</p><p>She nodded and changed her focus to incapacitating them by breaking kneecaps, dislocating shoulders, and occasionally snapping necks.</p><p>At her descent, boxes that fired silver needles emerged from the tops of two of the boats. Rozemyne pulled out her water gun, lined up her shot at one of them, and fired. Her bullet collided with the box and exploded into the liquid pulp of a gumka tree. The follow up bullet was imbued with a magic circle based on the one for summoning winter, though all it did was instantly chill whatever it hit, but not to the degree of forming ice crystals. This would make the gumka a little brittle, but not enough to make removing it any easier. It fulfilled its purpose of gumming up the mechanisms either way. Rozemyne repeated the maneuver on the second boat’s weapon.</p><p>Once both boxes were out of commission, Matthias and Laurenz landed on top of the boat and cut down the enemy that had clambered up after them, headless of Eckhart’s wishes to keep their clothing intact. After they dispatched with the immediate threat, Matthias and Laurenz started slamming the peen side of their hammers into the cracks between the silver tiles. When they made a gap large enough, they used the hammers like crowbars to leverage them out of place enough to drop in a couple of magic tools before blasting away from the ship.</p><p>Explosions rocked the boat, sending a handful of tiles flying through the air, one of which Angelica had to duck under as it zoomed by. While the silver blocked any mana from the tools, it didn’t block concussive force.</p><p>Matthias landed back on the deck and widened the small hole the explosion had left. Laurenz immediately threw a couple of paralytic poison magic tools through it before the two of them leapt inside, metal swords in hand. The boat soon began to rock with the force of the brawl occuring inside.</p><p>Leonore and Cornelius dropped onto the dock near Angelica, each taking one of the two ships that had been in the middle of loading, cutting down any silver-clad guards that stood in their way.</p><p>Eckhart joined Angelica on the dock and decided to use the fight as an opportunity to teach Angelica several maneuvers to incapacitate or kill opponents in a way to preserve the integrity of their belongings. Justus, who had left the confines of the pandabus, hovered over the end of the dock with a box in hand, dropping magic tools that delivered physical blows and concussive force to the enemy. He seemed to enjoy the annoyed look on Eckhart’s face whenever shrapnel ruined some of the silver cloth. Hartmut, meanwhile, remained inside Rozemyne’s highbeast with Damuel, the former to manage supplies and the latter to act as guard.</p><p>With things more or less in hand on the docks, Ferdinand flew inland, firing at the other Lanzenavians that were rushing across the beach in their attempt to flee the city. Most of these wore armor and carried shields, meaning the ones in charge of loading the boats weren’t expecting to see combat.</p><p>Just to confirm what they were wearing underneath their helmets, Ferdinand fired a couple of paralytic bullets at them, but they were largely unphased, save the jolt they received from the physical impact. Since his paralytic wouldn’t work on them, he switched to the new bullet Rozemyne’s Gutenbergs had made for him after she’d given him the idea. It was a simple metal ball with a pointed end that fit down the barrel of his water gun. While it was fired with mana, the bullet itself was mundane, meaning it could, in theory, pierce silver armor.</p><p>Ferdinand didn’t have many of the metal bullets compared to the number of mana-based ones he’d brewed, so he had to make his shots count. The armor was curved in a way that would deflect arrows, and he imagined it was fairly sturdy. With that in mind, he aimed for the joint between the neck and breastplate.</p><p>Blood spurted from the gap in his armor, and the man went down, clutching feebly at his wound. Aiming for such a small gap on a moving target from so far away was difficult to say the least. While he managed to take out three more, he also wasted four bullets. Changing tactics, he loaded a high-powered explosive bullet and fired at one of their knees. Again, while the mana that would have burned the man had no effect, the force of the explosion knocked his feet out from under him. He slammed against the ground, one leg bent at a wrong angle and his helmet falling from his head and bouncing along the beach. He had a mana arrow at the base of his skull before he could scream.</p><p>A cry of, “Oh, no you don’t!” came from behind him, and Ferdinand whipped around to find Rozemyne charging the final ship. Some of its crew had come out onto the deck to chip away at the hardened gumka that jammed their weapon. The somewhat bouncy texture was giving them some trouble, and they would have to work through at least a handspan of it to even reach the box, much less clear its barrel.</p><p>“Rozemyne, no!” Ferdinand yelled, but of course, she ignored him.</p><p>He breathed a sigh of relief as she held her schtappe out the window and transformed it into the God of Darkness’s cape, expanding it as it fell until it could cover the entire boat. As the men began to struggle underneath the cloth, Damuel leapt from the pandabus onto his own highbeast and landed on the cape, his feet wrapped in silver cloth to keep his mana from draining. He then darted along the length of the vessel, running his metal blade through the trapped men. It passed through the cape without resistance, leaving no trace behind.</p><p>When Damuel killed the last one, Rozemyne flew down and stepped out of her highbeast long enough to retrieve her schtappe before taking to the skies with her guard knight once again.</p><p>Ferdinand turned back to the beach and found Eckhart and Angelica making their way across it, the former armed with his giant cross-peen hammer and the latter with Stenluke. She darted in quick as Steifebrise and stabbed one of the men through the breastplate. Eckhart, meanwhile, caved in helmets as he ran by, evidently not caring about preserving them.</p><p>“Knight Commander!”</p><p>Matthias called to him from the ship he and Laurenz had subdued. Blood trickled from a gash above his right eye. “This one’s cleared. We’ll head to the last one!”</p><p>He nodded, and the two flew towards the final vessel, removing the hammers from their holsters as they went. Laurenz, too, had sustained minor injuries.</p><p>With the two of them taking care of things, Rozemyne flew over close to Ferdinand and transformed her schtappe into a water gun again. “Poison doesn’t work, I take it?”</p><p>“No,” he said, blowing out another knee. This one’s helmet didn’t come off, but he was still effectively taken out of the fight.</p><p>Rozemyne grimaced and said, “I’m going to go start loading up the kidnapped women and children.”</p><p>“Get the magic tools and feystones, too,” Ferdinand said.</p><p>“Of course,” Hartmut replied from the back seat.</p><p>With that, Rozemyne landed on the dock next to the first boat and expanded it as Damuel ran inside to start leading the people out. They struggled to get some to board a grun, but Hartmut managed to convince them without too much trouble. Letizia wasn’t among those on the first boat, but there was no telling at this point if she was among the captured or not. Things had unfolded so differently this weave that he couldn’t predict where she would be. He still had mixed feelings about the girl. While she had been under the influence of trug, she had still tried to poison him. If Rozemyne had agreed to marry him in the first weave, they likely would have adopted her upon their starbind, making her his daughter. While he felt no sense of loss in that regard, he’d still found her a tiresome child whose feelings were far too delicate, though she did show some promise. It had been difficult at the time to accurately gauge her intelligence since his previous experiences had involved teaching a gremlin with memories of being an adult woman and a dunce that couldn’t even read by the age of seven. Comparing her to the four archduke candidates of Ehrenfest now, she was on a similar level when they were her age, though he had to be far more careful to avoid hurting her feelings than he did with any of the other children.</p><p>He shook his head to clear it and shot one of the encroaching Lanzenavians in the helmet, sending it spinning off his head as his neck bent at an impossible angle. “Well, that’s much easier,” he muttered to himself before loading his water gun with the next explosive bullet and taking aim at the next fool who thought he might make it to the captured ships.</p><p>Overall, it didn’t take long to secure the beach, and Lanzenave stragglers stopped appearing by the time the last boat was emptied into Rozemyne’s highbeast. While the monstrosity wasn’t anywhere near as large as when she’d made living quarters out of it, it was still gargantuan. She’d had to make a second level to accommodate all the passengers and extend a “trailer” to make room for all the feystones, magic tools, silver cloth, armor, and weapons they’d commandeered.</p><p>The guard knights, however, had each sustained some form of injury, though nothing severe. Rozemyne healed them all, but it irked Ferdinand that it was necessary to begin with. To think they would let such weak opponents past their defenses. He would have to increase their training.</p><p>Ferdinand took out an ordonnanz and tapped it with his schtappe. “Knight Commander Strahl, this is Knight Commander Ferdinand. We have secured all of the people and items that were brought to the enemy ships. Please advise on where we can take them.”</p><p>A few moments later, the reply came. “<em>The castle is secure. You may bring them here. How many people do you need to assist?</em>”</p><p>“None,” Ferdinand said. “We’re bringing them now.”</p><p>“<em>While most of the fighting has ceased, the streets may not be safe enough for them to traverse.</em>”</p><p>“We will be arriving by highbeast,” Ferdinand replied. “Will the balcony on the east side do?”</p><p>“<em>Yes, someone will meet you there.</em>”</p><p>As they flew over the city, Ferdinand looked down and saw pockets of minor skirmishes here and there, but it seemed they’d subdued the enemy without issue. He saw Wilfried send up a rott as they passed, though a quick glance was enough to determine he was trying to lure out any remaining Lanzenavians. There didn’t seem to be any in the immediate vicinity from what he could tell. Closer to the castle, there was a large gathering of people, all of whom were bound either with light or mundane ropes, likely the ones hiding behind marked doors.</p><p>When they landed, Strahl, his vice commander, Lucius, and his guard knights awaited them. Upon seeing Rozemyne’s highbeast, the knights drew their weapons as a few cried out, “Is that a grun?!”</p><p>Lucius ordered them to stand down. “That is the Saint of Ehrenfest’s infamous highbeast. I thought it impressive when you first arrived, but by the gods, you could practically live in that thing. Just how big can you make it, Lady Rozemyne?”</p><p>She answered from within her highbeast as they were still unloading people and goods. “I’m not certain,” she said, pressing a finger into her cheek, “I’ve never tried to test its limits.”</p><p>“So it can get even bigger than this?” Lucius gasped. After a moment, he shook his head and walked over to the freed captives. “Ladies, it is to my great relief that I am able to welcome you back from your ordeal to our castle. Knight Commander Strahl will lead you to the grand hall which has been set with a light meal. I apologize, but I must ask you to stay with us for a while longer until we’re certain it’s safe for you to return to your homes.”</p><p>The women gave him deep curtseys, many with tears running down their cheeks. Lucius bade them stand and stepped to the side to allow them to pass. As they did, several offered their thanks to those from Ehrenfest and their aub. Rozemyne and all of her guard knights, save Angelica, had at least one woman show them the highest form of gratitude, and several offered the same to Aub Ahrensbach.</p><p>When the last of the freed captives left, Aub Ahrensbach went to the back of the pandabus to look in the trailer. “Ah, I knew you’d have a couple prisoners stashed away somewhere,” he said as he waved to his guard knights to pull the five injured men out. “A bit worse for wear, but healthy enough to live until we hand them over to the zent, should he want them once we finish reading their memories.” Once they were on their way to holding cells, Lucius peered at the remaining contents, and his face twisted with sorrow when he saw the box of feystones. “I… hope you still have families we can return you to,” he muttered to them, bowing his head regretfully. Looking back up, he told the vice commander to summon the scholars and servants to come unload and catalog what was gathered.</p><p>“Is there more back here?” Lucius asked as he came around the side of the highbeast and peered into the back seat through the window.</p><p>“Just the silver clothes, armor, and weapons we took from the Lanzenavians we defeated as well as our potions and magic tools,” Rozemyne said.</p><p>“Ah. Yes. I imagine you want to keep those?”</p><p>“If you would allow it.”</p><p>He waved a permissive hand. “Enjoy them. They’ll be a rare item now that the gate is closed. There will never be another shipment from Lanzenave unless the zent directly orders it.”</p><p>Rozemyne nodded. “Of course.” Then, she placed a troubled hand on her cheek and said, “It truly is a shame about the sugar, though.”</p><p>Lucius snorted. “You don’t have to worry about that. We’ve been cultivating it here for the past several months.”</p><p>Her eyes lit up like the sun breaking over the horizon, causing a twinge of something dark to prick at Ferdinand. At least she was controlling her overall expression. “I’m ever so glad to hear it,” she said.</p><p>“Yes,” he said, “I’ve heard so much about the things Ehrenfest does with sugar. I would be interested in finding out more.”</p><p>Rozemyne quirked an eyebrow. “Well, the second volume of Rozemyne’s Ravishing Recipes will be available at the next Archduke Conference, and it has several dessert recipes. Of course, if someone were to have access to more recipes I might not have heard of from foreign lands, I would love to purchase them.”</p><p>With a smirk, Lucius asked, “That so? I bet I could find someone who knows a few things. They may not be recipes, but I’m sure the genius who came up with so many desserts would be able to figure out how to make them if given a thorough description.”</p><p>“Would that any chefs, commoner or no, had knowledge of such dishes…”</p><p>That made Lucius raise his eyebrows. “I see. Well, I’ll see what I can do.”</p><p>“I would be ever so grateful.”</p><p>“Think nothing of it,” he said. “It’s the least I could do after what you’ve done for our duchy.” His attention was suddenly drawn away by an ordonnanz landing on his arm.</p><p>“<em>Aub Ahrensbach,</em>” came a deep, familiar voice that sent a chill down Ferdinand’s spine. “<em>Six people have emerged from the Lanzenave estate. They appear injured.</em>”</p><p>Lucius’s eyes widened, and he replied, “Capture them alive by any means necessary!”</p><p>Summoning his highbeast, Ferdinand said, “I’ll go provide support.”</p><p>The aub turned to him and said, “I would be grateful.” He then offered quick but unnecessary directions to the estate.</p><p>“Eckhart, Matthias, Leonore, Justus, with me,” Ferdinand said. “The rest of you, guard Rozemyne.”</p><p>As much as his fiancée wanted to protest, she couldn’t go anywhere while the servants were still unloading her highbeast. Justus quickly grabbed his box of tools from the back seat and joined the rest of them in the air before they flew towards the estate.</p><p>A slightly repelling sensation came over Ferdinand as he drew near, and his stomach began to churn with disgust.</p><p>There, standing on the path between the castle and estate, was <em>him.</em> The bastard who’d been involved in nearly everything that went wrong in Ferdinand’s life. He’d been born at the same palace, but he’d been chosen to receive a schtappe rather than become a feystone. His little pet wolfeniel, the Sovereign Knight Commander, had manipulated the king into sending him to Ahrensbach to clear the way for Georgine to take Ehrenfest and him to take the throne. He’d been with them when the tree brought them to the Garden of Beginnings where Rozemyne was first infused with Mestionora’s mana, which eventually led to her death.</p><p>Gervasio had his schtappe in one hand and a sword in the other, and he was facing down the six Lanzenavians who came stumbling out of the estate. None of them were wielding schtappes, meaning they never made it to the Farthest Hall. Upon seeing Gervasio and the five people from Ehrenfest, they stepped back and got into defensive stances. They all wore silver cloaks. Ferdinand could only assume they’d left them behind in the estate so they could put them on after they teleported back.</p><p>When Ferdinand was overhead, Gervasio looked up and squinted as he turned his body so he could face both possible threats at once. “Yellow capes,” he called in his deep voice. “You are the reinforcements from Ehrenfest, then?”</p><p>“My lord,” Justus breathed.</p><p>“Not now. Keep your guard up,” Ferdinand hissed before he answered, “Yes, we are. I am Knight Commander Ferdinand, archduke candidate of Ehrenfest.” He brought his highbeast down, but he didn’t dismount, choosing instead to be ready to take off at a moment’s notice. He produced his schtappe and transformed it into a shield.</p><p>Gervasio’s eyes widened slightly. It seemed Lucius had somehow found the time to tell his father about him. That, or the glimpse of his eyes that Gervasio could see between the helmet and mask was enough to confirm the circumstances of his birth.</p><p>A smile broke out on the man’s face as he said in a quiet voice, “I’m glad someone else made it out alive. I am Gervasio, most recently of Ahrensbach. I’m sure you know of my original home, such as it was.”</p><p>Ferdinand scowled and turned towards the Lanzenavians, his shield still pointed at Gervasio. “The aub wants us to capture them <em>alive</em>,” he said, letting the man know he wouldn’t tolerate any attempts to silence them.</p><p>“Yes, I’m aware,” he replied, a sickening amount of amusement in his voice. “The fourth one back is Leonzio, the leader.”</p><p>Ferdinand nodded and then gave the signal to attack. Eckhart dropped from his highbeast and delivered a kick to the head of one of the men, sending him flying across the garden.</p><p>“Alive, Eckhart!” Ferdinand barked.</p><p>“He’s still breathing, my lord!” Justus called as he landed near him. “Well, sort of. Hmm… Might have to heal you to keep you from choking on your own blood. What a waste of mana.”</p><p>Just a few moments behind Eckhart, Matthias leapt from his highbeast and charged into the midst of the group. He ducked below a swipe from one of them and punched him in the gut, dropping him to his knees. Dodging the fist of another, he countered with an uppercut that sent the man sprawling.</p><p>Leonore, meanwhile, swooped down and ran forward with a ball in each hand. She blocked the first man’s punch with her forearm and then smashed the ball against his face, breaking it on his forehead before yanking down his mask. He crumpled as she turned to face Leonzio.</p><p>He pulled a couple of magic tools from his pocket to throw at her as he yelled, “Gervasio, will you betray your own people?!” Leonore picked up the man she’d just incapacitated and held him in front of her, letting his silver cloak take the impact. Using the man like a weapon, she kicked him at Leonzio, who managed to sidestep. While he was dodging his comrade, Leonore closed the distance and then kicked him between the legs. It took a couple of seconds for him to drop, but from the look on his face, he’d likely suffered permanent damage.</p><p>Wincing at the sight, Gervasio called back, “You led an attack against those from Lanzenave who chose to settle down here, and you dare claim I’m a traitor? Did I not merely return to the place of my birth?”</p><p>Leonzio, of course, could offer no reply.</p><p>By this point, Ahrensbach knights had arrived, and they’d subdued the last man before helping to tie up the rest.</p><p>“Quick work,” Gervasio said. “So tell me, how has life been for you here in Yurgenschmidt?”</p><p>Ferdinand answered him with a glare.</p><p>That didn’t seem to deter him from asking more questions. “You look pretty young. I was long gone before you were born, so I doubt we’re siblings, but perhaps uncle and nephew?”</p><p>“I am an archduke candidate of Ehrenfest,” Ferdinand said. “I am no relation to you.”</p><p>“I understand,” Gervasio said, lowering his head. “I, too, have often wished to forget that place and cut any and all ties with it. However, it became my motivation to find something better for my people and to prevent that horrid practice from continuing. And now here I am, talking to a nephew I never knew I had.”</p><p>“Ah, I see. Your age seems to have affected your hearing. Let me repeat myself, then. I am an archduke candidate from Ehrenfest. My father was the previous Aub Ehrenfest. My only uncle is his brother.”</p><p>“Well, perhaps in time,” Gervasio said with an infuriating, indulgent smile on his face. “I would be honored to welcome a new family member.”</p><p>“Then I wish you luck in finding a new bride for your son,” Ferdinand spat. He moved his highbeast several steps back and kept his eyes on him as he pulled out an ordonnanz. “Rozemyne, this is Ferdinand. Are you able to come pick up the prisoners?”</p><p>“<em>Yes, give me just a moment. The scholars aren’t finished unloading, but they said it wouldn’t cause any trouble for me to leave for a little bit.</em>”</p><p>Turning his full attention back to Gervasio, he asked, “Where is Raublut?”</p><p>Without so much as pausing, Gervasio pulled out an ordonnanz and tapped it with his schtappe. “Raublut, this is Gervasio. Report on your location.” The bird, however, didn’t fly. He closed his eyes with apparent resignation as he lowered his head for a few moments.</p><p>“It seems he’s gone to the distant heights while fighting against the Lanzenave threat.”</p><p>Ferdinand barked a laugh. “Spare me the theatrics. What sort of fool do you take me for?”</p><p>Gervasio shot him an offended look. “Pardon?”</p><p>“Do you honestly expect me to believe that you think he fell while defending Ahrensbach? The man who was caught trying to trug the royal family, faked his death to escape punishment, and hid in Ahrensbach under your and Georgine’s protection?”</p><p>Narrowing his eyes, Gervasio replied, “Trug, you say?” He looked away and held his chin in thought, likely coming up with his next lie. “He said he was laying the groundwork for me to negotiate with the zent a few years ago. Could that have been what he meant? Did he start working with Lady Georgine because he was hiding from the royal family?”</p><p>Shaking his head, he said, “He sought to help me in my quest to bring those wishing to leave Lanzenave here. If it is as you say, then I can only assume he learned from his grievous error and found a more peaceable solution with Lady Georgine.”</p><p>“The solution where your son took the foundation and unwittingly gave her the key to open the portal connecting the Lanzenave estate and Adalgisa palace? Stop playing the fool. I already know you mean to become zent. Why else would Raublut work against the royal family and lead the Lanzenavian invaders to the Sovereignty to get their schtappes?” The last part was speculation based on Raublut’s absence and the previous weave, but Ferdinand sincerely doubted he was wrong.</p><p>Gervasio didn’t move for several moments as his brows furrowed in confusion. Then, he abruptly turned and walked to the prisoners that the knights and Justus had just finished binding. Kneeling down in front of Leonzio, he grabbed him by the hair and lifted his head. “What happened to give you all these injuries?”</p><p>When he didn’t answer, Gervasio pressed his schtappe against the underside of his chin. “What happened, Leonzio?”</p><p>“Eckhart!” Ferdinand barked. “Ensure he does not kill the prisoner!”</p><p>Leonzio started chuckling. “You may have delayed my plans, but you ruined your own in the process.”</p><p>“Is that so?” Gervasio asked as Eckhart drew close, metal sword in hand. “Care to explain?”</p><p>Still laughing, Leonzio said, “Your lapdog is dead. So, was tipping them off worth it? I can try again, but you can’t get your inside man back.”</p><p>Further attempts to get him to divulge more information led nowhere. In the middle of it, Rozemyne landed next to Ferdinand. Before he could tell her not to look, she gasped and covered her mouth, turning away from the sight.</p><p>“My deepest apologies, Rozemyne,” Ferdinand said with a grimace. “I was not expecting interrogations to begin.”</p><p>“Why aren’t you stopping him?”</p><p>“Because right now, I can hear Leonzio’s answers. I won’t be privy to what they discover later.” After a few more moments, however, Ferdinand saw this wasn’t going anywhere. “The transport is here. Stop wasting time.”</p><p>Gervasio glanced over at them before turning back to Leonzio. “Very well. We’ll just have to search your memories. Do keep in mind this can be done even after your death.”</p><p>“Hey! Wait!” Leonzio said. “You can’t do that to a foreign national!”</p><p>Everyone ignored his ludicrous protests.</p><p>When Gervasio stood and started walking towards them, Rozemyne gasped, but she quickly schooled her features again as Ferdinand stepped in front of her.</p><p>“You’re rather protective of your young fiancée, aren’t you?” Gervasio asked.</p><p>“You have no reason to speak with her,” Ferdinand growled.</p><p>“Do I not?” he asked. “She helped save the duchy I now call home, and now she is transporting our prisoners in a most intriguing highbeast.”</p><p>“Eckhart,” Ferdinand barked, “load them up!” All the knights, including those from Ahrensbach, moved to obey. Once all six prisoners were inside, he told Rozemyne to take them back and suggest to Aub Ahrensbach he destroy the estate, or at least the portal, to prevent any more unwanted guests from arriving. They could always teleport to the center with the border gate without having to step foot in that filthy palace.</p><p>Gervasio pulled out his own highbeast as Rozemyne left with her two guards. “Well, as glad as I was about our meeting, I’m afraid it may be our last if things are as dire as I expect. If that is indeed the case, then allow me to wish you well, Knight Commander Ferdinand of Ehrenfest. May you have all the happiness denied to the others.”</p><p>Ferdinand glared after him as he left, heading to what was likely his estate in the city.</p>

<p>As I stood on the transfer circle at the country gate, I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. This was the last moment of respite I was going to have for a while. While potions could restore my mana and stamina, they couldn’t replace sleep, no matter what Uncle said. I hadn’t gotten a glimpse of Schlaftraum’s realm last night after dittering Aub Dunkelfelger with Uncle Ferdinand, finding out my little sister had been kidnapped, and being forced to stand around, unable to do anything to help her. Then, I’d had to rush back to Ehrenfest at first bell and defend the city from my aunt and her army. It hadn’t been an especially difficult fight, but it’d felt twice as long as it was after a sleepless night. Thankfully, I’d at least been able to take a nap in the afternoon, but only for a couple of bells before Rozemyne’s ordonnanz woke me up, letting me know I had yet another battle to fight.</p><p>I couldn’t really complain, of course, as future knight commander. The Lord of Winter hunt would likely be even more grueling than this, but I couldn’t deny the strain the past two days was putting on my body. Still, if it meant protecting everyone I cared about and getting back at the bastards who hurt my sister and threatened my home, then I was all for it.</p><p>As Rozemyne pulled out her Grutrissheit and used it to activate the transportation circle, I began to consider getting my own copy. I’d gotten all the tablets like she’d suggested, but I stopped short at getting proof of zenthood. She made it look so useful, though, and I was willing to bet there were some amazing battle tactics and offensive and defensive magic circles hidden in its pages. Watching her take us from Ehrenfest to Ahrensbach, I only had one real complaint.</p><p>How come my little sister was having to do all the teleporting? She’d brought the Dunkelfelger knights to Ehrenfest in two groups, and now she was taking all of us to Ahrensbach, also in two groups. Rozemyne had just been kidnapped last night, and she probably hadn’t been able to get any more sleep than I did. Yeah, she was pretty strong, but couldn’t Uncle show a little more consideration for her condition? I could understand him wanting to hide the fact that he’d gotten his Wisdom since every weapon you hid from your opponent was another weapon they couldn’t prepare for, but come on! You’d have to be an idiot not to know he’d already gotten it! There was no way he’d let a tome chock full of magic circles slip through his fingers.</p><p>When we arrived, Aub Ahrensbach was there to greet us.</p><p>I froze.</p><p>The aub looked like my uncle, just younger with brown hair and a square jaw. They had to be related. There was no way this was just coincidence. Since he didn’t resemble Father at all, he must have looked like Uncle’s mother. Just what woman was out there having kids with men with archduke-level mana in two different duchies? It didn’t make any sense!</p><p>Also, how did this woman’s children keep ending up at the temple?</p><p>Did Uncle and Father know about this?</p><p>As I tried to figure out my new unofficial family tree, Aub Ahrensbach thanked us for coming, gave us a brief update of the situation, and told us where to go. No nonsense. Exactly as a commander should act in the midst of battle. Just like Uncle.</p><p>I didn’t see any ordonnanzes or rotts as we flew over the city, which didn’t bode well. That meant either there wasn’t anyone to send or receive them, or so many people had been killed or captured that everyone knew not to use them. Either way, there were a lot of victims. The thought made my stomach churn. Casualties had been almost nonexistent in Ehrenfest, but we’d gotten advance warning from the border and were able to mount a strong defense around the city. Here, the enemy was already inside before the attack began. I had to give them credit for the plan. Had things gone Aunt Georgine’s way, we wouldn’t have brought reinforcements to Ahrensbach, but as Uncle often said when we were discussing tactics over gewinnen, “No plan survives contact with the enemy, and no enemy can plan for Rozemyne.”</p><p>As we reached the south side of the city, I said, “Alright, everyone! Fan out! Sweeping procedures! One in the air, two on the ground! Rotate as necessary!” My guard knights hadn’t practiced with the strike team very much, but they could follow basic orders like these just fine regardless. Alexis stayed by my side, and Lamprecht flew above, scanning our surroundings. They each held a sound-blocking tool so that when Lamprecht saw something, he could let Alexis know without being heard by the enemy. Alexis would then deactivate the tool and relay the information to me.</p><p>We dismounted and drew our metal blades, walking down the streets and alleys as we listened for any movement. Sadly, this part of the city, the one furthest from the castle and likely least protected by the knight’s order, was dead silent. I tried not to think too much about what that meant as I continued to make my way down the street. Instead, I did as Bonifatius said and focused on the task at hand. That meant thinking about the people I could still save, not the ones that were already lost.</p><p>The eeriest part of walking through the deserted streets was hearing the sounds of battle not too far away. It piled more and more nervous tension on me, putting me on edge. Being in the midst of a fight was far more preferable to the anticipation of it.</p><p>Finally, we cleared the dead quarter and Lamprecht called out, “Two in silver armor, on the left.” Alexis and I came out from the side street and saw the pair, talking to each other as they sauntered down the street like they were on an Earthday afternoon stroll. They turned when they heard us and they shouted, “Feystones!” as they raised their swords.</p><p>Enhancing my legs, I rushed the first man. I was on him before he could finish crying out in surprise, plunging my blade through his armpit. He dropped about the same time as Alexis’s opponent, and we both took the sacks of feystones from their bodies. “Good riddance,” I muttered. We looked down the street but didn’t come across anyone else. The survivors were probably huddled in their hidden rooms.</p><p>As we moved further towards the center, Lamprecht spotted a group of five men prowling down one of the streets, looking for victims. Before they noticed us, I pulled out an exploding magic tool and threw it at them. It hit one of them square in the back, sending him flying into two of his buddies as the rest toppled over from the force. Two of them lost their helmets, so Lamprecht sent a spear through the neck of one. Alexis darted in and stabbed the other in the throat. I stomped on the breastplate of a third man, caving it in and crushing his chest. By then, one of the others had managed to get to his feet and was charging at me, sword raised. With a swipe of my hand, I threw a dagger at the gap under his helmet, lodging it in his windpipe. Alexis had taken care of the remaining one, crushing his helmet under his feet.</p><p>With a sigh, I realized we were quickly running out of room for the feystones we were taking from the enemy.</p><p>We moved ever forward, the clashing of metal on metal and screams of the wounded and dying drawing closer. The third group we came across had thirteen men, and three of them were in silver cloth, not armor. I felled those idiots with three daggers in as many breaths while the others charged me and Alexis. I snapped the knee of the first who got near me with a kick and followed that up with a second to another’s side, sending him flying. Lamprecht finished him off with another spear through the back of his exposed neck. For the third, I sidestepped his slow blade and rammed mine just below his breastplate. It would have been a pretty painful death, but Lamprecht would end the man’s suffering.</p><p>The fourth one swung at me as I was freeing my blade, making me have to abandon it to step out of range. As he lunged at me, I dodged his thrust and punched him in the side of the helmet, caving it in. The fifth guy managed to nick my forearm as I retrieved my sword, his blade sliding through my armor like it was made of air. While I knew silver weapons cut through feystone armor, it was disconcerting to see in the midst of battle. It drove home that I might as well have been out here naked for all the protection it gave me from the enemy.</p><p>Alexis had his dagger thrust up under the man’s helmet before I even had time to register the pain. He, too, was sporting a cut on his left cheek, though it was shallow. He and Lamprecht had taken care of the others and sent the incapacitated ones to the distant heights.</p><p>This group exceeded our capacity to carry feystones, so we had no choice but to leave them behind.</p><p>“Lord Wifried?”</p><p>“Yeah, Alexis?”</p><p>He pointed at the estates lining the streets. “I’ve been thinking about this for a while, but have you noticed that only some of the doors have been kicked in, and the ones that haven’t have a purple… I don’t know what that is, a leaf maybe? Whatever it is, it’s painted on their doors.”</p><p>I frowned as I looked up and down the street, finally noticing the same thing. “Well, you know what that means, don’t you?”</p><p>“Traitors?”</p><p>“Traitors.”</p><p>“Round them up?”</p><p>I shook my head. “Nah, I don’t want to drag them across the city while we still have enemies to fight. Besides, not only are they probably mednobles just following whatever their faction is doing, they’re likely holed up in their hidden rooms. Let’s worry about getting archnobles, and those after we finish with the Lanzenavians. Come on.”</p><p>Once my two guard knights switched places, we continued to make our way towards the center of the city. I had expected to run into more and more Lanzenavians, and I was partially correct. We dispatched with two more small groups of them, but then when we reached a main thoroughfare between the med- and archnoble estates, we were met with a couple dozen armor-clad bodies strewn about. Most of them had massive dents in their armor, suggesting the Ahrensbach’s Knight’s Order was either using war hammers of some sort or body enhancement. Either way, it seemed the anti-magic equipment wasn’t enough to completely catch them off guard.</p><p>Two other three-man groups from the strike team reached the street, and I gave them the hand signals for, “We’re okay. Are you?” and “Did you see any battle?” The answer to the first was yes, but it seemed each of them had come across roughly what we did - just a couple of pockets of stragglers that had slipped through the Knight’s Order’s fingers.</p><p>I motioned for them to keep going as Lamprecht ran down the street a fair ways before checking the other side and coming back. “I counted 5 marked doors,” he said.</p><p>“Huh. Not as many as I was expecting. Guess Auntie wasn’t as popular with the mednobles as I thought.”</p><p>Lamprecht shrugged. “More likely, her supporters just live in a different part of the city.”</p><p>“Yeah, that’s probably it,” I sighed. “Let’s move on.” We kept going, and as we got closer to the center, we started seeing more Lanzenavian corpses. “Either these guys are really weak, or they’re turning any knights they kill into feystones,” I said.</p><p>“I’d bet the latter,” Lamprecht said. “Though they haven’t put up much of a fight so far, so who knows?”</p><p>At last, we reached the battle proper. Blue and purple capes rushed about, chasing down men in silver. The Ahrensbach knights were all wearing makeshift masks, confirming my suspicions that any knights they lost had been turned to feystones. They’d evidently learned the hard way about the poison. There had only been a couple of people in the border provinces of my duchy that fell victim to it, and it was terrifying to hear about. I could only imagine the horror of seeing half a dozen comrades suddenly vanish as the tiny clinking of their feystones striking the pavement filled the air.</p><p>The fight itself was completely one-sided. Dunkelfelger was knocking down the Lanzenavians like a ternisbefallen before a herd of zantzes. Ahrensbach wasn’t far behind, though they needed a couple more hits to take their opponents down.</p><p>“Let’s go!” I said, rushing to join the battle. With over two dozen enemies in my immediate area, I didn’t have the time to aim for weak points in their armor. I also couldn’t rely on explosives with my allies being right on top of them. I sheathed my sword and punched the first man I reached, crushing his helmet. My next two punches and three kicks caved in breastplates, as did the stomp I delivered to a man who stumbled over a body and fell flat on his back.</p><p>Of course, going for hand-to-hand combat in a throng of swords came with risks. I received several cuts across my arms, one on my chest, and two across my back. They were all minor, though, so I ignored them and kept going. Eventually, I ran out of enemies to punch, and I looked around. Off to the side were three Lanzenave captives, tied up and waiting to be taken in for interrogation. The number of Dunkelfelger knights had doubled, the strike team was reunited, and the air was empty of clashing metal and pained screams. The three groups of reinforcements had completed their assignments.</p><p>The leader of the Dunkelfelger contingent, Eberhard, and I went to speak with the Ahrensbach knights. A shorter man with a dark green beard stepped forward when he saw us approach. “Good evening. I’m Vice Commander Bastian. Thank you for your assistance.”</p><p>We both introduced ourselves, and Eberhard asked, “Did your knights clear the north?”</p><p>He nodded. “Once Aub Ahrensbach let us know you had arrived and reached your destinations, we moved back to the castle and performed a sweep towards the middle.”</p><p>“There might still be some out there,” I said. “We should try to lure them out. Oh, and there are all those marked houses, too. None of them were breached, so we assumed they were traitors.”</p><p>Bastian asked, “So you noticed?”</p><p>“My guard knight did.”</p><p>“He’s got keen eyes, and your assumptions are correct. They knew this was coming and put those marks on their doors so the Lanzenaves would skip them. I’m going to have the Ahrensbach knights make note of the marked houses and capture anyone they find inside. Lord Wilfried, if you would, try to lure out any of the enemies that might be lurking still. Lord Eberhard, I’d like half of your men to do the same and the other half to assist with the search for traitors.”</p><p>When we both nodded, Bastian immediately got to work pairing off Ahrensbach and Dunkelfelger knights, and I started coordinating with our new team. We decided to split into eight groups of three and spread out to different parts of the city. From there, we would send ordonnanzes to each other and see if that brought any of the enemy out of hiding. Once that stopped producing results, we would send up rotts one at a time.</p><p>I, Lamprecht, and Alexis headed for our spot to the center of the northern district. Several Dunkelfelger and Ahrensbach pairs came with us since it was where the archnobles lived. Any marked houses here were priority as they would have been the ones to know the full extent of what was going on. Many med- and laynobles would have just been following what their faction was doing without knowing all the details.</p><p>As they kicked in doors and broke through windows along our street, an ordonnanz from one of the strike team members landed on Alexis’ arm. As we waited, some of the knights started coming out of the estates with bound traitors. One nearby managed to break free, so I wrapped her in bands of light, cutting her escape short. Since I was an archduke candidate with Rozemyne’s compression method, there was no way she could break my bands.</p><p>The knights marched or carried the traitors over to a plaza near the castle to be taken to holding cells later. All through the maneuver, no Lanzenavian appeared. I wasn’t surprised, given how many knights were present. As the search began taking them elsewhere, I had Alexis send a reply. Maybe the strike team members would have more luck where they were.</p><p>We received two more ordonnanzes, and still, no Lanzenavians. Eventually, it was time for me to send up my rott. As I did, I saw my little sister’s highbeast blot out a significant portion of the sky as she passed overhead. I could guess it was filled with the kidnapped women and children from the boats.</p><p>Turning my attention back to the task at hand, I waited for a response to my rott, but none came.</p><p>“Either we got them all,” I said, “or they’ve given up hunting people.”</p><p>Alexis continued to scan his surroundings as he said, “Yeah, hard to say which, but I doubt there are enough left to pose a significant threat to this duchy. Their Knight’s Order is competent enough to handle any stragglers that come slinking from the shadows.”</p><p>On my order, Lamprecht sent Bastian a message letting him know our situation. His response sent us to the plaza to guard the steadily growing number of traitors. Once we took up our posts next to the Ahrensbach knights, one of the prisoners spat, “Ehrenfest knights in Ahrensbach? You spurn us after all those years of asylum, overtake us in the rankings with dirty tricks, and now you invade our duchy and pull us from our very homes?! When will it be enough for you, huh?! How much more do you have to see us suffer before you’re satisfied?! Our former First Lady was the sister of your aub, and you have the audacity to treat us this way? Despicable!”</p><p>We paid them no heed. Uncle has been very clear in training about not engaging your prisoners unnecessarily. After all, any information they didn’t have could be used against them during interrogations.</p><p>When they got no response from us, they started throwing insults, saying we were nothing but a backwater duchy with delusions of grandeur and that they would be there watching when we fell back to our proper place again. I didn’t think the guy who said the last part understood the position he was in.</p><p>“You try to attribute your trends to that summer flower from the temple, but we all know they come from that motherless man who still reeks of blue robes.”</p><p>It took a concerted effort not to clench my fists. I knew he was just trying to find a way to hurt us. His words were the only weapon he had left to wield, and it was up to me to decide how effective they would be. Taking a deep breath, I turned my focus to watching for anyone else coming to the plaza, and all of the posturing from the prisoners became an annoying buzz in my ears.</p><p>As the knights were dropping off laynobles, Bastian walked over and said, “Most of them are likely in their hidden rooms, but we know who they are now. We’ll go ahead and start taking these ones over to the holding cells if you wouldn’t mind continuing to guard them.”</p><p>“Oh, let me send a message to my sister. She can carry them all at one time.”</p><p>Bastian blinked at me, and I explained how she could change the size of her ride-in highbeast to accommodate as many passengers as she wanted. That didn’t seem to clear his confusion, but he gave me a hesitant nod. “Rozemyne,” I said to the white bird, “this is Wilfried. We have some captives that need to be transported. Are you able to come to the northern plaza to retrieve them?”</p><p>“<em>Yes, they just finished emptying Lessy of everything from the boats. I’m on my way.</em>”</p><p>When Rozemyne and the Ahrensbach knight commander landed, the Ahrensbach knights drew their weapons with cries of, “Grun!”</p><p>I held up my hand and said, “That’s her highbeast. She appreciates strength and chose to model hers after a powerful feybeast.”</p><p>They regarded the pandabus and me dubiously, but they said nothing else as they loaded up the prisoners. When they finished, I and the rest of the strike team joined Rozemyne’s knights to escort her to their knight building where the holding cells were located.</p><p>She landed the bus close to the entrance of the cell block, and the knights in purple started dragging the captives away.</p><p>“Is this all of them?” The knight commander asked with a furrowed brow.</p><p>Bastian shook his head. “Several are probably still in their hidden rooms. We know who they are, though, and they can’t stay in there forever.”</p><p>As the last of the traitors was being taken in, an ordonnanz arrived for the knight commander, telling him that everyone, including those from Dunkelfelger and Ehrenfest, needed to come to the castle. Rozemyne received the same message from Uncle, so we all prepared to fly over. Before I could mount my highbeast, however, Lamprecht and Alexis rushed over.</p><p>“My lord,” Lamprecht said, “forgive me for what I’m about to request, but could you heal us?”</p><p>I raised a brow at him as I looked over the members of the strike team and my guard knights. There were injuries, sure, but nothing worth delaying our trip to the castle over.</p><p>“The knight commander is waiting for us at the castle, is he not?” Alexis asked. When I nodded, he continued, “Please imagine what he will do when he sees us injured from fighting relatively weak opponents.”</p><p>My eyes widened. He would definitely make us run drills and exercises until we were on the brink of death from both mana and physical exhaustion. “Gather around,” I called, waving my team over as I produced Flutrane’s staff. Its appearance startled the Ahrensbach knights, who gaped at seeing the divine instrument.</p><p>They really needed to get into their temple more.</p><p>“If anyone else needs healing,” I said to the group at large, “come on over.”</p><p>The Ahrensbach knights seemed hesitant, but when some of Rozemyne’s guard knights came over, they joined as well.</p><p>After healing everyone, I dismissed my staff and prepared to leave. Matthias approached as I summoned my highbeast and said, “Lord Wilfried, while it is too late for us to escape the knight commander’s wrath, we greatly appreciate your offer to heal us as well.”</p><p>I laid a sympathetic hand on his shoulder, which seemed to startle him. It occurred to me then that I had picked up the habit from my future father-in-law. I would have to be more mindful in the future.</p><p>It was too late to retract now, so I just pushed forward. “May Glucklitat lead you safely through the Lord of Evil’s trials.” Apparently, my sympathy was truly heartfelt because mana drained from me and came out as a blessing for my sister’s guard knights that I’d healed.</p><p>They looked up at the light with somewhat grim expressions.</p><p>Deciding this was the limit to the awkwardness I could handle, I mounted my highbeast and headed for the castle.</p><p>“Lord Wilfried!” a Dunkelfelger knight called when I landed. I recognized him from the welcome ditter, but I couldn’t recall his name. “Tell me, how were the battles you faced?”</p><p>I shrugged. “Nothing worth mentioning, really. Even when they had the two of us surrounded, they weren’t much of a threat despite their weapons. They all went down from a tap on the helmet.”</p><p>He laughed and slapped my shoulder a couple of times. “As one would expect from Lady Hannelore’s fiancé! We faced no challenge, either. Rather disappointing if you ask me. Here we are, all ready for a real ditter, and it’s nothing more than culling pests.”</p><p>I shrugged, unable to bring myself to agree. I’d faced feybeasts before, but this morning was my first taste of real battle, and I couldn’t say I liked it. While I had no problem fighting when necessary, I didn’t want to seek it out. If my opponent was weak, then all the better. I was less likely to lose knights that way.</p><p>As we talked, a servant led us to a meeting hall where long tables laden with food were set up. My stomach growled at the sight, and it wasn’t the only one. The knight I was talking to let out a cheer and rushed over to join some of his fellow Dunkelfelgerians.</p><p>Looking around, I spotted my sister, Uncle, Heisshitze, and the knight commander talking off to the side. I went to join them, and they fell silent at my approach. “What’s going on?” I asked.</p><p>Uncle said, “The aub is performing an entwickeln to destroy the Lanzenave villa.”</p><p>I raised my eyebrows. “Just like that?”</p><p>Rozemyne placed a hand on her cheek. “It’s a single building that isn’t being replaced with anything, so the cost is relatively low. Ferdinand built an entire temple without warning once.” She shook her head at the memory as though exasperated, but there was still the hint of a warm smile on her lips.</p><p>“Ah, that makes sense,” I said. “It shouldn’t take long, then.”</p><p>“I expect the aub will return before the meal is over,” Uncle said. “If you plan to eat, go ahead and have your guard knights poison test your food so you might eat it when it’s still at least partially warm.”</p><p>I gave a signal to Lamprecht, and he immediately got to work. Meanwhile, Hartmut and Justus were doing the checks for Rozemyne’s and Uncle’s plates. It almost made me reconsider my decision to leave my head scholar behind, but he would have been a liability if he were with me or a strain on Rozemyne if he stayed in her highbeast.</p><p>Well, that wouldn’t be true for much longer, thanks to Hartmut’s inability to think of cutting off someone’s head to ensure their memories could be read after confirming their death. I felt sorry for the scholars, having trained under Bonifatius myself, but knowing they could defend themselves if necessary would be a bit of a relief, especially in situations like this. Not that I expected to have to fight off invasions from other duchies or foreign countries again, but one could never be too careful.</p><p>Eventually, our retainers finished the poison checks, so we went to sit at the end of one of the tables. Uncle’s expression hadn’t changed in the slightest, as usual, but I got the impression he was trying to avoid the Dunkelfelgerians.</p><p>His plan, however, failed almost immediately. As soon as he was seated with his plate before him, three knights, including Heisshitze, sat down with us.</p><p>“Lord Ferdinand!” Heisshitze said, his eyes burning with excitement. “Tell us how it went at the docks.”</p><p>“We won.”</p><p>“What? No! Tell us the tale! I want to hear how the Lord of Evil fought against silver ships in real ditter!”</p><p>Uncle sighed and shot a glare at him before he turned to Rozemyne. “You are something of an expert on stories, no? Your telling of events would be more entertaining than mine.”</p><p>She gave him a smile I recognized - the one where she was annoyed by having to do something she found troublesome. I couldn’t have any sympathy for her, however, because I was dying to hear about it, too.</p><p>After they finished their staring contest, she relented and began telling the tale of the battle at the docks. By the time she finished, a crowd had surrounded us as people strained to hear her words.</p><p>When she finished, the Dunkelfelger knights filled the hall with a cacophony of shouts, some praising members of the team, some trying to ask questions, and some just yelling out of enthusiasm. The Ahrensbach knights were not completely immune to the atmosphere, either. Their eyes glowed with excitement as they joined in with questions and praise of their own.</p><p>Uncle answered none of them, seeming to focus completely on his food.</p><p>I looked down at my own plate, the contents long since cold. Still, I took a bite, and a wave of bitter nostalgia crashed into me like an ivory wall. Memories of sharing meals with my grandmother flashed through my mind, each of them filled with happiness at the time. Now, though, each time I saw her smiling face, I remembered the snarl on her lips and the crazed light in her eyes as she spat lie after lie about my uncle and little sister. At the same time, I recalled the warmth Grandmother had shown me when I was young, how she would hug me, pat me on the head, praise me…</p><p>As I took a second bite, I fought down a lump in my throat as I tried to push back the memories. I wasn’t allowed to look on them fondly. I had to either bury them or resent them. No one would ever let me do otherwise. If anyone knew the feelings that came over me when I thought of Grandmother, they would clamor for my execution or imprisonment, saying I was siding with a criminal and thus deserved to be treated like one.</p><p>I once thought of talking to Father about it. He was probably the only one who understood what I was dealing with. I was afraid, though. He’d been the one to condemn her. Maybe he’d locked away his memories and feelings and would be disappointed that I couldn’t do the same. Or maybe he’d think letting me be knight commander was a risk since I still cared about a criminal and had committed the sin of going to see her.</p><p>When I looked up, I met Rozemyne’s gaze. Her large, moon-like eyes seemed to see right through me. Even though neither of us said a word, I got the impression that she knew exactly what was going through my mind and that she wanted to help her big brother in some way.</p><p>I smirked. It was stuff like this that made people call her the Saint of Ehrenfest. Maybe she was. No one else could pick up on my feelings like this, nor did I think they would want to.</p><p>Even if all of that was just in my head, it still made me feel a little better, like I wasn’t completely alone anymore.</p><p>Just then, the Ahrensbach knights straightened up, and I turned around to see the aub walking through the entrance, his mouth pulled into a grim line. “Knight Commander Strahl, Knight Commander Ferdinand, the Lanzenave estate is gone. I will need to start interrogating the prisoners and preparing the relevant ones to be taken to the Sovereignty for further questioning.”</p><p>Uncle stood up and said, “Then allow me to come with you.”</p><p>The other knight commander looked at him askance, but Aub Ahrensbach waved for him to come along like it was a foregone conclusion that he’d be present for the interrogations. I gave my sister a questioning look. It was weird, after all, for another duchy’s knight commander to be present for this sort of thing, but maybe they wanted a third party involved since some of the prisoners were from another country. Then again, with Lady Georgine’s involvement, an outsider could easily say the aub was part of it, too. With Uncle there to verify everything was handled appropriately, people couldn’t say Aub Ahrensbach was trying to hide something.</p><p>After they left, Rozemyne went to talk with one of the servants, and I finished my meal, exchanging stories about all the battles we fought today with the Dunkelfelger and Ahrensbach knights. The latter were uncomfortable when we talked about Lady Georgine’s invasion. I wanted to assure them that we didn’t hold her actions against the people of the duchy, but as an archduke candidate, that would be as good as saying we didn’t need any reparations. I didn’t know what Father was going to ask for, but I knew it would have to be something.</p><p>As the conversation came to a brief lull, Rozemyne came over and asked, “Wilfried, there is something I would like to discuss with you if you have a moment.”</p><p>“Huh? Oh, yeah, sure.” As I got to my feet, she motioned to Matthias and Laurenz, and they came over to join us.</p><p>“They prepared a meeting room for us,” she said. “Whoever you bring with you needs to be someone you absolutely trust.”</p><p>I gulped, realizing she’d only called over her name sworn. I debated for a moment before deciding to bring Lamprecht. He’d been with me most my life, and he knew how to keep his mouth shut when necessary.</p><p>Rozemyne led me to a smaller room off to the side. When we sat down, she ordered her knights to turn around, so after a brief pause, I did the same. Then, she passed me a sound-blocking tool.</p><p>At first, she said nothing, her fingers twisting around each other in her lap. A glimmer caught my eye, and I saw a glimpse of a feystone and mana chains peeking out from under the edge of her glove.</p><p><em>Good gods, Uncle! Just how much damn ice will it take for you to be satisfied?</em> I didn’t even want to think about how many more charms she had hidden on her person. I didn’t know how she could bear to wear her newest charm right against her skin like that. Then again, she’d been wearing a courtship necklace since she was ten. She was probably used to it by now.</p><p>“Before I was baptized,” she said, pulling me out of my thoughts, “there were people who took care of me. Very dear people.”</p><p>I leaned forward. She never really talked about her time in the temple before she was baptized.</p><p>“I’m no longer able to see them. I haven’t been for years. I’m… I’m not supposed to even really talk about them. I have to pretend I barely even know them, despite how close we were when I was young.”</p><p>I frowned in confusion. “Why?”</p><p>She shook her head. “It’s not something I can really talk about.”</p><p>I tried to wrack my brain for a reason she couldn’t talk about some gray robes she could no longer see. I understood that they were probably sold off or worse, but I couldn’t think of any reason why she would be banned from even bringing them up. Maybe they had gotten involved with the wrong noble looking for flower offerings?</p><p>“Anyway,” she said, “sometimes, I’ll see something that reminds me of them, or I’ll eat something that we used to share when I was young, and I get flooded with all these memories and emotions that I have to hide because I have to pretend they didn’t happen, that I don’t really know them, and it… It feels…”</p><p>When she mentioned eating, it hit me why she was telling me this. She really had seen through me. At first, I thought she made the story up, which would explain the holes, but the pain in her eyes was too real. I imagined my own reflected it as the memories of my time with Grandmother came to mind once again.</p><p>She reached out and placed a hand over mine, a silent acknowledgement that I wasn’t alone anymore. Swallowing the lump in my throat, I asked, “Is this okay? She… She was the one who hurt you.”</p><p>“Maybe,” she said, “but she was special to you, wasn’t she?”</p><p>“Gods, Rozemyne, you can’t make me cry here,” I joked, trying to lift the mood so I wouldn’t give in. “This isn’t a hidden room. If Uncle finds us like this, I’m going to be greeting the Supreme Couple.”</p><p>My little sister, however, didn’t stop looking at me with that expression full of an old, soul-deep pain that was indescribable to anyone who hadn’t experienced it.</p><p>“Damn it,” I said, wiping my eyes with my forearm.</p><p>She didn’t say anything as hot tears kept rolling down my cheeks. She just held my hand and sat with me, her face just as wet as mine.</p><p>There was so much I wanted to say, so much I wanted to get off my chest, but my throat kept clenching down on my words. I wanted to say that I loved my grandmother. I wanted to shout that it wasn’t fair. She should have been a better person. She shouldn’t have done what she did. She shouldn’t have been locked in the tower. I shouldn’t have been tricked into going inside. She shouldn’t have said those awful things to me. I shouldn’t have had to go the rest of my life pretending I didn’t love her anymore.</p><p>It was so childish, complaining about how life wasn’t fair. Of course it wasn’t. Rozemyne had been left alone in the temple because her parents were protecting her from a woman in my grandmother’s faction. She had lost some of the people who had taken care of her there, and then she lost her freedom because of my grandmother. I felt so petty wanting to complain about my life when she objectively had it worse. At least I was able to run as a child. She didn’t even have any memories of playing in the snow because the one time she tried, she collapsed.</p><p>Even knowing all that, it didn’t take away the sense of injustice. It just made me feel guilty for still having it.</p><p>In a perfect world, Grandmother would have been a better person, and she would have been doing what every other retired wife did - supporting Mother and supplying the foundation. Rozemyne would be my cousin, having grown up happy and healthy with her parents. Uncle would have had a mother and wouldn’t have suffered like he did under Grandmother.</p><p>This wasn’t a perfect world, though, and despite how much I loved her, Grandmother still did unforgivable things to the people I cared about. It was hard, but I could accept that truth.</p><p>But I couldn’t accept that I still loved her and wanted to see her.</p><p>I turned my hand over and squeezed Rozemyne’s as I finally realized that even though I had to hide these feelings from the world, maybe it was okay to still have them. She did, too, after all, and she was a saint. I might not ever get to share these feelings with anyone but my little sister, but that didn’t mean I was wrong or a bad person for having them.</p><p>Eventually, I calmed down and let go of Rozemyne. “Thanks,” I muttered, not sure what else to say as embarrassment started overwhelming every other emotion swirling in me.</p><p>She smiled and reached forward, healing my eyes. I did the same for her and then handed back the sound-blocking tool. “Alright, Lamprecht,” I said, “let’s go.”</p><p>I went back into the hall where everyone was still eating and talking, but now there were some women and girls among them, talking with the knights from Ahrensbach. I guessed they were their wives, children, and sisters who had been rescued from the boats.</p><p>When Rozemyne emerged from the room, several of the reunited families came over and thanked her, Matthias, and Laurenz. I got the impression this wasn’t the first time they had offered them their gratitude, and I couldn’t blame them. How could you thank someone enough for saving your life?</p><p>“Rozemyne!”</p><p>Silence fell over the room as we spun to see Uncle marching towards us, his cape billowing behind him. Aub Ahrensbach was following, giving orders to knights around him to prepare for departure.</p><p>“What is it?” she asked, meeting him halfway.</p><p>He looked around and then guided her to the room we had just exited, Eckhart, Matthias, and Laurenz trailing behind.</p><p>“Knights of Ahrensbach!” the aub called. As they stood at attention, he said, “The first and second, prepare to depart for the Royal Academy. Sixth, go assist the third in preparing prisoners for transport. Fourth, fifth, seventh, and eighth, protect the city. Ninth and tenth, the castle.”</p><p>“Yes, Aub!”</p><p>As they got moving, I called the Ehrenfest knights over. “It’s safe to assume we’ll be going to the Royal Academy, too,” I said. “Does anyone need healing or potions?”</p><p>There were a couple who needed the latter, but I’d already taken care of the former when Rozemyne was dropping off the captives.</p><p>I walked over to Heisshitze and asked if I could heal any of them, which they gratefully accepted. “So the battle continues!” he yelled, much to the excitement of the rest of his knights.</p><p>Shaking my head, I said, “It’s possible, but the Sovereign Knight’s Order may have already taken care of everything.”</p><p>Heisshitze laughed. “Let’s not forget our own Aub Dunkelfelger! He was going to return to the Academy after he opened the border gate for us.”</p><p>“Oh, then it’s definitely taken care of,” I said.</p><p>The door flew open, and Uncle came storming out. Every Ehrenfest knight stiffened with instinctual fear. His face was normal, and his shoulders were relaxed, so to the uninitiated, he might have looked like he was moving with purpose, like he just needed to get somewhere fast.</p><p>We all knew, though. He was angry.</p><p>I looked at Rozemyne, but she just sighed and crossed her arms, basically shouting her intent not to get involved any further.</p><p>Fine. I’d have to take one for the team. I hoped they’d put my feystone to good use.</p><p>I drew close to Uncle, each step as difficult as moving my hand closer to a flame. “Knight Commander?” I asked.</p><p>He spared me a fleeting glance before muttering, “No one can plan for Rozemyne.”</p>

<p>Ferdinand stood in awkward silence next to the man who had once been his guard knight as they waited for Lucius to finish investigating Leonzio’s memories. It felt odd pretending to not know Strahl after spending a year and a half with him in the previous weave, but perhaps he truly didn’t know him anymore. Who knew how Strahl had changed without suffering under Detlinde’s incompetence and his dismissal? Both had had a significant impact on him, after all.</p><p>After several moments passed, Ferdinand asked, “Knight Commander Strahl, I don’t mean to pry, but I wonder about the safety of your young archduke candidate. Letizia, I believe her name was. It didn’t seem there was an archduke candidate among those we rescued from the boats.”</p><p>Strahl gave a brisk nod. “You are correct that she wasn’t with the captives. As soon as word arrived about the attack, Aub Ahrensbach rushed her to the Northern Building and had her and her entourage hide in her hidden room.”</p><p>That explained why Ferdinand didn’t see Fairseele, either. “The aub saw to it personally rather than leave it to her guard knights?”</p><p>Strahl scratched his cheek. “He cherishes her as his future daughter. He tends to dote on her, saying it must be difficult for her being away from her birth parents and losing her adoptive father and sister.” He paused before adding, “And mother as well, I suppose.”</p><p>Ferdinand held back a scoff as he nodded politely. Lucius’s ridiculous actions were just further proof Lanzenave had no sense of propriety. He wondered if they were even worse than the people of Rozemyne’s old world. Well, they probably didn’t bathe in front of people of the opposite gender like she had done, so perhaps they were marginally better.</p><p>Eventually, Lucius came out, his face pale and his lips pulled into a tight line. He waved a hand, and Strahl set up a sound-blocking tool before stepping out of range along with Justus and Eckhart.</p><p>“Well?” Ferdinand asked.</p><p>Shaking his head, Lucius replied, “Raublut was going to use Prince Sigiswald’s feystone to open the way for Leonzio and his followers to get schtappes as we suspected. He was also apparently expecting his accomplice in the prince’s retinue to have directions for obtaining the Grutrissheit.”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“And what?”</p><p>Sighing, Ferdinand asked, “Do you expect me to believe Raublut committed treason and tried to give Lanzenavians schtappes to gain nothing in return? What was his reason to go through with this inane plan? Or did Leonzio not know?”</p><p>Lucius snorted. “He has his suspicions, but I suppose only the zent will truly know since Raublut did indeed d—climb the towering staircase.”</p><p>If that were the case, then Ferdinand could look it up later in the Book of Mestionora. “Anything else?”</p><p>“It was a one-sided massacre as far as Leonzio’s group was concerned at the Royal Academy,” he answered. “Aub Dunkelfelger and around fifty knights were waiting for them. The idiots that came stumbling out of the Lanzenave estate used a feystone with my mana to activate the teleportation circle again.”</p><p>“Was there another group fighting?” Ferdinand asked, raising a brow at Lucius’s choice of words.</p><p>“Some of the Sovereign Knights Order who were loyal to Raublut. The new knight commander and the third queen led the charge against them with support from Dunkelfelger and Professor Eglantine. Leonzio fled when Raublut fell, but the battle was still raging.”</p><p>Eglantine’s title gave Ferdinand pause for a moment until he remembered Lucius had likely studied under her when he attended the Royal Academy during the off season. He was less surprised by her participation in the battle. She had been the one to leap in front of the royal family with her shield during the ternisbefallen attack in the last weave.</p><p>He had no doubts that Dunkelfelger would win, so the battle didn’t concern him. He was far more interested in the future of Ahrensbach. “You’ll be turning Leonzio over, no?”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>“And does he know about you?”</p><p>“…Yes.”</p><p>Ferdinand held back the urge to smirk. “I can assume that Raublut’s goal was to put Gervasio on the throne.” Lucius grimaced, confirming it. “Once your connection to Lanzenave and Gervasio are revealed, you won’t remain aub. You will be lucky to escape punishment by association.”</p><p>Lucius shook his head. “Lord Gervasio is innocent in all this. He was completely unaware—“</p><p>“Do you think that matters?” Ferdinand asked, cutting him off.</p><p>“Then what will happen to Ahrensbach?!” Lucius snapped. “Letizia is too young to take over, and there is no one else left.”</p><p>Ferdinand sighed. “That is certainly a concern. I can only think of one thing that might let you remain as a relay aub at least until Letizia graduates and is able to dye the foundation.”</p><p>Lucius looked down, his eyes clouding over. “If I turn Gervasio over, too, as a show of loyalty to the zent…”</p><p>“Correct. Neither of you will be permitted to return to Lanzenave. He will be punished either way. All you’re deciding is if you will be punished alongside him.”</p><p>As Lucius ground his teeth, Ferdinand inwardly breathed a sigh of relief. He had been worried that Raublut had moved purely out of revenge without involving Gervasio at all. Even if the Lanzenavian king was ignorant of the knight’s movements, it wouldn’t excuse him if they were done for his benefit. Even if Lucius turned his own father over, history proved he wouldn’t escape punishment. Now, Lucius and Gervasio, the only people standing between him and his promise to reunite Rozemyne’s family, would willingly deliver themselves to the royal family to fall upon Ewigeliebe’s sword. It would be child’s play to convince Aub Dunkelfelger to give him Ahrensbach afterwards. He might even be able to ditter him for the right to make Rozemyne aub instead of himself.</p><p>Eventually, Lucius shook his head and said, “We don’t have time for this. We should bring the prisoners to the Royal Academy and assist with the battle.”</p><p>“Agreed.”</p><p>Lucius had Strahl deactivate the tool before ordering three of his guard knights to retrieve his father.</p><p>When they arrived back at the grand hall, Ferdinand immediately took Rozemyne to a side room, had their retainers turn around, and passed her a sound-blocking tool. “We don’t have long,” he said. “Help me search the Grutrissheit for Raublut’s memories. I need to know exactly what he was planning.”</p><p>She nodded, and they both summoned their wisdom. Hers, thankfully, still looked like a proper book, so she wouldn’t have to waste time searching. As his opened, he began scanning through the last 30 or so years of Raublut’s life to piece together the plan he’d tried to execute this weave.</p><p>“Umm, Ferdinand?”</p><p>His thoughts were interrupted by Rozemyne, whose book was still closed. “You’re looking at Raublut, right?”</p><p>“I am.”</p><p>“Because…I don’t have his entry.”</p><p>He frowned. “What do you mean you don’t have it? Do you have Detlinde’s or Georgine’s?”</p><p>Her book opened twice. “Yes, I have those, but not Raublut’s.”</p><p>“What changed between this morning and now?” he asked.</p><p>As Rozemyne pressed her finger into her cheek in thought, Ferdinand caught a glimmer from underneath her glove. “Wait, Rozemyne, are you wearing the chain sleeve I gave you?”</p><p>“Yes, I put it on before coming here.”</p><p>With a sigh, he said, “That’s it, then. That sleeve was designed to block the gods from pouring mana into you or taking over your body. Evidently, that means Mestionora isn’t able to update your Wisdom while you wear it.” That, or she simply refused to out of spite.</p><p>“Oh, I’ll just remove it then.”</p><p>“No!” Ferdinand cried. “I’ll search the Grutrissheit myself. We’ll be going to the Royal Academy after this where a battle may still be taking place, so prepare for that.”</p><p>When she nodded, he turned back to his book. The first thing he found - Raublut’s motivation - hurt far worse than he’d been expecting. Some of it he had known, of course, but he’d purposely put it out of his mind. Being confronted with it once again, however, had brought all the feelings he’d kept buried since he was a child to the forefront of his mind.</p><p>Ferdinand was born to be a feystone. Just before he was to serve his purpose, the zent ordered Aub Ehrenfest to claim his illegitimate son under the guidance of the Goddess of Time. Lanzenave, however, still needed its feystone, so they made use of a worn-out resource that was nearing the end of its usefulness anyway. They slew the woman who had given birth to him and sent her stone in his place. They had then taken Raublut’s fiancée as her replacement, only for her to be purged after the civil war.</p><p>He closed his eyes as he tried to organize his feelings into tightly sealed boxes to be stored away with all the other useless emotions he’d spent years divorcing himself from.</p><p>It didn’t matter. Nearly thirty years separated him from that wretched palace. He didn’t have that many memories of living there to begin with. There was no existence as a “mother” to him, just a woman who thought of him as Glucklitat’s trial. There was nothing about that time that should hold any meaning for him, nothing that deserved more than a passing thought.</p><p>His heart refused to believe that lie.</p><p>A warm hand on his arm brought him out of his reverie. Rozemyne was staring at him with her piercing, moon-gold gaze, her face full of concern. There were no words of conciliation on her lips, only the comfort of silence. How he longed to enter the safe place her eyes promised him, to curl into her and let her warmth chase the cold ache from his chest.</p><p>This wasn’t the time, however. He pushed down the despair welling up inside him and turned back to the book.</p><p>Raublut had wanted revenge for the lover he had lost twice over. He would do anything to depose the false king and drag down the proud duchy who had taken her from him. To that end, he gathered allies and found a way to contact the one person who could see his vengeance through.</p><p>Gervasio hadn’t wanted to go to Lanzenave, and he reviled the Adalgisa palace. Raublut was convinced the man would agree to take the throne. Discovering he wanted a home for the mana wielders of his new home made it all the easier to lure him back to Yurgenschmidt. All he needed to do was get Georgine to agree to play her part, which was easy enough. She was so focused on the piddly Ehrenfest that she left herself open to manipulation.</p><p>Once Gervasio was in Ahrensbach, Raublut broached the topic of zenthood with him, but he’d shown no interest in taking the throne himself, only negotiating with the current zent to have his people educated in the manner of nobles so that they might live well as full citizens in their new land.</p><p>Incensed, Raublut put together two plans, certain one of them would work. First, he would say he was making inroads with the zent to allow negotiations to occur. He would claim, however, that the zent planned to reinstate Adalgisa. Helping Georgine fulfill her obligations to Leonzio by taking his people to get schtappes would serve as proof of the zent’s intention to ally with Lanzenave. Gervasio would surely take the country’s foundation to prevent that from happening</p><p>If that was not enough to force his hand, however, Raublut would ensure Lucius’s origins were revealed to the zent, who would be in mourning for his son. After the role Lanzenave played in Sigiswald’s death, Trauerqual would readily move against Lucius. Gervasio would have no choice but to take the throne to save his son and his people.</p><p>In the end, this weave’s Raublut didn’t care about his true master, only his revenge. Perhaps that was true in the last weave as well. It didn’t matter. In the end, Ferdinand had what he needed to obtain what he wanted.</p><p>Smirking to himself, Ferdinand said, “Ahrensbach may well be ours before the night is through.”</p><p>“Umm, Ferdinand?”</p><p>He looked up to find a troubled-looking Rozemyne, clutching nervously at her Wisdom. “What?” he asked, an impending sense of dread slithering towards him.</p><p>She stared at the floor for several moments before seemingly gathering her courage to meet his eye. “I don’t want Ahrensbach.”</p><p>His stomach fell. “What do you mean you don’t want it? Is this not what we’ve been working towards for the past several years?”</p><p>Huffing, she said, “First of all, it’s what <em>you’ve</em> been working towards for years. You only recently let me know about the plan to take over. Secondly, things were in a dire state when I became aub in the previous timeline. There wasn’t anyone else. Now, though, their aub seems to be a good person, and he clearly has their respect.”</p><p>“What interactions have you possibly witnessed to determine their levels of respect?”</p><p>“Uh, excuse you? Did you forget I carried all those women and children in Lessy after we saved them? Do you think we all just sat there quietly?”</p><p>Ferdinand scoffed. “You couldn’t have carried on a meaningful conversation in such a short time, and even if they spoke positively of him, it was likely no more than an affectation of their relief at being rescued.”</p><p>“Did you know he’s given the entire duchy an extremely effective compression method?” she asked. “The <em>entire duchy.</em> No contracts. No payment. No strings attached. He just gave it to them. They didn’t tell me what it was, but it sounds like it’s on par with mine, maybe even better.”</p><p>That was all the more reason to take Ahrensbach as far as he was concerned. He’d love to get his hands on that method.</p><p>“I see what you’re thinking,” she said, “and it’s ridiculous. You can just ask Raimund when he comes to Ehrenfest.”</p><p>“Rozemyne,” he said, “what about your family?”</p><p>Her face fell, and her gaze drifted to the floor again. “Yeah, I know, but if the current Aub Ahrensbach is removed, what does that mean for all the Lanzenave families that came here to find a better life? What about the little girl he’s supposed to be adopting soon? He’s all she has left now that Lady Detlinde and Lady Georgine have climbed the towering staircase. I don’t want to reunite with the people I care about if it means tearing apart other families. I… I can’t knowingly bring this pain to others.”</p><p>All of his plans, everything he had worked towards since he returned, unraveled before him, the frayed strings falling from his fingers as they fluttered to the ground. What good would it do to take the duchy if she would resent him for it? He should have seen this coming. It had taken quite a bit of convincing - no, <em>manipulation</em> - to get her to agree to be Aub Ahrensbach in the previous weave, and she’d already taken the foundation at that point.</p><p>How was he going to keep his promise to her now?</p><p>“What would you have me do?” he asked. “At this point, Lucius will be removed once his origins are revealed. The Lanzenavians who became citizens will likely be purged as well. The duchy will be left leaderless.”</p><p>Her lips pulled into a tight line. “He fought to protect Ahrensbach. There must be a way we can convince the zent to let Lord Lucius remain aub and let the peaceful Lanzenavians stay. Ahrensbach was already low on mana, and they’ve lost so many nobles. They can’t afford to lose any more. <em>Yurgenschmidt</em> can’t afford to lose more.”</p><p>“You would ask the impossible,” he sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. Her being the incarnation of Mestionora had given him so much leeway in the past weave. Without that to rely on, his bargaining power was negligible by comparison.</p><p>“Well,” she said with a shrug, “there’s always one surefire method to get one’s desired results. It’s always worked for me in the past.”</p><p>“Rozemyne, no.”</p><p>She shrugged again. “Then I suggest you come up with an alternative before we arrive at the Royal Academy.”</p><p>Ferdinand glared at her as her words backed him into a corner. He very much detested this feeling of helplessness in the face of her unpredictability and obstinacy. Wordlessly, he held out his hand, and she passed him back the sound-blocking tool. Spinning on his heel, he stormed out of the room, his mind racing to find a way to fulfill her ridiculous wish.</p><p>Wilfried approached, his voice tense as he asked, “Knight Commander?”</p><p>Ferdinand glanced at him and sighed. “No one can plan for Rozemyne.” Casting his gaze over the gathered knights, he said, “Prepare to depart for the Royal Academy. Be ready to fight.”</p><p>“Yes, Knight Commander!”</p><p>“Clarissa, you may join Rozemyne’s retinue again.”</p><p>The woman, who had been with the Dunkelfelger knights assigned to the castle, lit up as she replied, “Yes, Knight Commander!”</p><p>Nodding, he turned and walked across the room to where Lucius was talking with Strahl. “Aub Ahrensbach,” Ferdinand said, “we shall be traveling to the Royal Academy as well.”</p><p>“Ah, we’ll need to get you some brooches so you can pass through the Ahrensbach dormitory, then,” he said. Before Ferdinand could protest, the younger man turned to his head attendant and asked him to make the necessary preparations. “We should have plenty,” he said. “Since you’re coming along, am I safe in assuming your fiancée will be joining us as well?”</p><p>Ferdinand narrowed his eyes.</p><p>“I only ask because if she were willing, her highbeast would make transporting the prisoners much easier.” Lowering his voice, he said, “It would keep her out of any fights we might encounter as well.”</p><p>Damn this man for making Ferdinand feel any appreciation towards him! “I shall ask if she would lend her assistance,” he said, working to keep his jaw from clenching with annoyance. “However, the teleportation circle to the dormitory can only transfer three to four people at a time, no? It would be much faster to travel by the country gate.”</p><p>Lucius blinked at him and then nodded. “Ah, yes, you’re right. If you would not mind, then we’ll use the gate. When will you be ready to depart?”</p><p>“At a moment’s notice.”</p><p>“Then I must ask for your patience as we prepare. In the meantime, I’ll need to send word to the royal family about our arrival.”</p><p>“Please feel free to leave that to me as you focus on your preparations,” Ferdinand said. He needed to lay the groundwork as quickly as possible to the extent time would allow to fulfill Rozemyne’s request.</p><p>Lucius hummed to himself for a moment before he said, “Very well, but I will still have my scholar write up something to send. We’ll add your correspondence to it.”</p><p>He would expect nothing less. Taking his leave, he waved Justus over towards the side room and had him produce writing implements. The first thing he did was sketch out a letter with a basic explanation of what had occurred and their purpose in coming to the Royal Academy. After passing it to Justus to give to the Ahrensbach scholar, he wrote a magic letter directly to Aub Dunkelfelger, discussing Raublut’s plan, Lucius’s actions, the current state of Ahrensbach, and the details of their victory. Finally, he wrote a second magic letter to Sylvester letting him know the results of the battle.</p><p>Once it flew off, he asked, “Justus, what were you able to find?”</p><p>“Raimund is alive and well,” he replied.</p><p>“Good. A shame we won’t be able to bring him into my service sooner.”</p><p>With a shrug, Justus said, “Perhaps it’s for the best. It seems his mana capacity has been increasing dramatically the past couple of seasons.”</p><p>“Ah, the aub’s mana compression method,” Ferdinand said, holding his chin in his hand. Rozemyne was right; he would be able to learn Lucius’s method through Raimund, provided the boy would share it. “Justus, what are the chances he’ll be a match for one of Rozemyne’s unattached retainers?”</p><p>The scholar frowned as he considered the question. “Perhaps Philine, but I believe she has her sights set elsewhere. Muriella is less diligent about compression, so he may be able to catch up to her with enough effort. She’s a romantic, however, and he’s… Well, he’s Raimund.”</p><p>“Indeed,” Ferdinand replied, throwing away the idea. The boy could come serve him after graduation regardless. His only concern was the possibility of Raimund finding an Ahrensbach woman and choosing to stay with her instead. Marriage to one of Rozemyne’s retainers would solve that issue, but he could hardly expect the boy to court someone as romance-obsessed as Muriella successfully.</p><p>When he left the room, Ferdinand approached Rozemyne and said, “Aub Ahrensbach would like to request your assistance in transporting the prisoners.”</p><p>“I don’t mind,” she said, “especially for someone who recognizes how cute Lessy is!”</p><p>Ferdinand suddenly wanted to retract the request, but he stifled the dark emotion that had sprung to life in his chest. Instead, he went to discuss plans with Wilfried, Damuel, Eckhart, and Heisshitze as Rozemyne spoke with Lucius.</p><p>Eventually, the knights Lucius had sent off returned, and silence fell over the grand hall as they escorted Gervasio into the room.</p><p>Several pairs of eyes darted between Ferdinand and the Lanzenavian king, and Wilfried murmured, “Gods, where does he fit on the tree?”</p><p>Ferdinand shot him a glare but otherwise didn’t respond.</p><p>Aub Ahrensbach cleared his throat and called Ferdinand over. “Knight Commander Ferdinand, if you would, please accompany Lady Rozemyne to the holding cells to retrieve the prisoners. Knight Commander Strahl and Lord Gervasio will accompany you.”</p><p>Gervasio gave his son a sad but understanding smile before turning to Ferdinand. “Then I shall be in your care, Knight Commander Ferdinand.”</p><p>A chill went down his spine hearing the man say his name, but he ignored the feeling of cold slime coating his skin and called over Eckhart and Rozemyne’s guard knights. Together with Strahl, Gervasio, and several Ahrensbach knights, they flew to the holding cells, put the prisoners to sleep, loaded them into the pandabus, and then flew out to the country gate.</p><p>Before long, all 142 people traveling from Ahrensbach arrived at the center. Upon leaving the teleportation chamber, they met Aub Dunkelfelger, much to the Dunkelfelger knights’ excitement. He sported several minor wounds but seemed none the worse for wear overall, despite the physical and mana exhaustion he was surely suffering.</p><p>It was perhaps because of this that he allowed so much of his surprise to show when he laid eyes on Lucius. His shock only increased when he at last noticed Gervasio, who was surrounded by Ahrensbach knights. “Good gods,” he breathed. Addressing the Lanzenavian king directly, he whispered, “Adalgisa?”</p><p>A shiver went down Ferdinand’s spine. The aub knew of his origins. Raublut recognizing him was to be expected; the man had worked at the palace, after all. How foolish had he been to think no one else would see the connection? He’d assumed the current generation of aubs wouldn’t know because they were too young to have visited the palace to begin with, much less to have seen Seradina. Perhaps her replacement resembled her as well. The princesses of the palace tended to have been born there as well, so it was possible the replacement was a close cousin of hers.</p><p>Somehow, the idea of Aub Dunkelfelger knowing the truth made Ferdinand feel wretched and worthless. He was nothing but a disgusting creature born in a filthy place meant for nothing more than powering the magic tools of a foreign land.</p><p>And Aub Dunkelfelger, someone with whom he shared mutual respect, knew it.</p><p>Ferdinand’s mask had been violently ripped away. He’d spent nearly thirty years cultivating the perfect facade, working tirelessly to meet and exceed the expectations foisted on him by his status, the promise he made with his father, and the desire to stand by Rozemyne’s side. Every step he took was another step away from that dark past. Every layer of mask he put on was another layer of obfuscation of the truth.</p><p>And it was all for naught.</p><p>He felt dirty and exposed, as though Aub Dunkelfelger had found him stipped naked lying in the filth of the old lower city.</p><p>Gervasio, however, experienced no such turmoil. His eyes merely widened momentarily before he gave a curt nod.</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger let out a long sigh as he ran his hand over his white hair, spreading more of the blood from the gash on his forehead through it. “That complicates things. Still, I see you’re not bound like the ones in Rozemyne’s highbeast.”</p><p>“Indeed,” Lucius said as he stepped forward. “He is a key witness you will likely want to speak with after you’ve finished with them.” He waved a flippant hand at the pandabus to indicate the prisoners.</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger nodded. “I see. I see. Well, Aub Ahrensbach! Ferdinand! Brave knights! I’m afraid you’re a bit late if you wanted a piece of the glory to be had here at the Academy, but I hear you earned no small amount of it in the land of darkness! Come, come! My knights can assist with cleanup before returning home. Lady Rozemyne, the Sovereign Knight Commander will lead you to the interrogation chambers. I believe you’re already familiar with him.”</p><p>The man behind him bowed to Rozemyne, and she graced him with a noble smile. “It is good to see you well, Lord Loyalitat.”</p><p>“As it is you, Lady Rozemyne, Saint of Ehrenfest. Come, this way.”</p><p>“Oh, wait just a moment!” she said before turning back to Aub Dunkelfelger. “After I drop these men off, might I be permitted to heal all the injured?”</p><p>“Hey, hold it right there!” Wilfried barked. “You’ve been spending tons of mana since yesterday. If any healing is getting done, then I’ll be the one to do it! Don’t forget that you’re not the only one who can summon Flutrane’s staff.”</p><p>“Didn’t you spend a ton of mana during the fight, though?”</p><p>Wilfried snorted. “Please, that was nothing compared to training under Uncle. Even Leonore’s training was tougher than that.”</p><p>“Oh, my, is that so, Lord Wilfried?” Leonore asked as she placed a hand on her cheek and smiled at him. The color drained from his face as he turned to face her. “I shall endeavor to meet your lofty expectations the next time I take the lead.”</p><p>“Uh, there’s no need–”</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger’s loud laughter cut the boy off. “Wilfried, my son,” he said, slamming his hand down on his shoulder, “sometimes, a man must know when to graciously accept defeat. Come now. There are plenty to be healed! Let us gather in the Auditorium for healing, and then we shall move to the Small Hall. Rozemyne, we’ll see you there momentarily.”</p><p>“Before that,” he said, “have you sent anyone to clear the Adalgisa palace?”</p><p>The aub sighed. “We can’t find it.”</p><p>“Justus.”</p><p>His attendant produced a piece of magic paper and a self-inking pen. Ferdinand quickly sketched out a magic circle to summon the help of Anhaltung. “Here, have your knights use this when you draw near to it.” He then explained the general location of the palace.</p><p>“Ha! You can always count on the Lord of Evil in these matters!” Aub Dunkelfelger said. “I imagine I could have found the solution had I the time to look for it. Regardless, your assistance is appreciated. Heissheitze! Your group looks uninjured.”</p><p>“Indeed, Aub!” he replied. “Lord Wilfried healed us.”</p><p>“As expected of my future son-in-law!” the aub laughed. “Here. Take half of the knights and go clear the Adalgisa palace. There may yet be enemies lurking within its walls. I trust you heard the location?”</p><p>“Yes, Aub!” he said, taking the magic circle from him. He then selected around forty knights to accompany him before taking off.</p><p>“Well, then, Rozemyne,” Aub Dunkelfelger said. “You may transport the prisoners. Come, Ferdinand. We have much to discuss.”</p><p>Ferdinand fought the urge to grimace as he motioned for the strike team to go with his fiancée. She and her ridiculous highbeast trundled off with Loyalitat and several Dunkelfelger knights joining her. Since none of the Dunkelfelger knights that came from Ahrensbach needed healing, they immediately set to work. The dead were beheaded, their heads placed in leather sacks for later memory reading, then the mana organ was pierced and the feystone collected. Any undamaged equipment got set aside while everything else was put into piles for disposal. They would eventually waschen everything once they were through.</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger sent off several ordonnanzes, and a handful of people awaited them in the auditorium when they arrived. Magdalena and Eglantine were among them. When the former saw Ferdinand, she stiffened. He fought the urge to scoff at her. She was already married with a child, and he had a fiancée. It was well past time for her to move on. He had long ago.</p><p>At least she had the sense not to open her mouth. That was until she saw Gervasio and Lucius. Her mouth dropped open slightly, but Aub Dunkelfelger gave her a hand signal, which seemed to mean, “Leave it alone.” She slapped her jaw shut and went back to wrapping her wounds. It seemed she’d fared worse than her brother. Eglantine wasn’t in pristine condition, either, and the pointed looks she gave Ferdinand and Aub Dunkelfelger suggested she knew about the Grutrissheit and was not pleased with having lost the race for it.</p><p>“Eglantine!”</p><p>Anastasius cried out as he entered the auditorium before rushing to her side. “What happened?” he asked. “There weren’t supposed to be any enemies where you were.”</p><p>“There weren’t,” she said, “which was why I was available to support Queen Magdalena when the traitors of the Sovereign Knight’s Order attacked her. The former knight commander had managed to slip by everyone else somehow to go gather his allies.”</p><p>“He put up a tough fight,” Magdalena said. A bold smirk crossed her face as she added, “But nothing a woman from Dunkelfelger couldn’t handle. Princess Eglantine’s support was appreciated, of course. We were able to take down Raublut together. It’s a shame we couldn’t take him alive.”</p><p>Anastasius gaped at Eglantine. “You fought Raublut?”</p><p>She nodded. “Is it not my duty as a member of the royal family to protect the peace so many died to obtain? He threatened to disturb it, so I had to do my duty. I’m grateful we were able to stop him before he’d wrought anymore havoc.”</p><p>The prince grimaced but nodded. “You did well, Eglantine.”</p><p>She graced him with a genuine smile. “I thank you ever so much, Anastasius.”</p><p>As they talked, more knights piled into the auditorium, most with mild to moderate injuries. King Trauerqual and Princess Adolphine soon joined them, bringing the last of the injured with them. Everyone knelt, but he was quick to have them stand again.</p><p>Adolphine had no injuries to speak of, but the king had several. It seemed the traitors had truly earned their place among the Sovereign Knight’s Order.</p><p>Magdalena rushed to her husband’s side. “Are you alright?”</p><p>He waved her off. “They’re only superficial. Had they not had those silver weapons, I wouldn’t have had even these. I only have myself to blame for constantly relying on a shield that couldn’t block their swords.”</p><p>“It is more difficult than people think to overcome years of training,” Magdalena said with a comforting smile.</p><p>“Everyone!” Aub Dunkelfelger’s voice boomed from the stage. “Please gather here in the center so that my future son-in-law can heal you.”</p><p>“All of us?” Magdalena asked.</p><p>Anastasius sighed and shook his head. “You have to leave all notion of common sense behind when dealing with the archduke candidates of Ehrenfest.” His gaze met Ferdinand’s, and he added, “<em>All</em> the archduke candidates.”</p><p>Ferdinand narrowed his eyes at him but otherwise didn’t react to the jab.</p><p>Once the injured were grouped together, Wilfried took the stage and summoned Flutrane’s staff. Several in the crowd gasped, including Magdalena. They had surely heard the stories of the three children summoning divine instruments, but this was the first time many of them had seen it done.</p><p>Wilfried held the staff aloft and began the prayer, channeling his magic into it. The green feystone at the top glowed brighter and brighter with each word he spoke, illuminating Aub Dunkelfelger’s proud expression as he stood to the side. Mana burst from the top of the staff in a green blessing that rained down on those gathered in the center of the room, and everyone looked down at their healed wounds, several in awe.</p><p>“He really healed all of us at the same time.”</p><p>“Do you feel like some of your energy has come back, too?”</p><p>“Good gods, are all of those kids saints?”</p><p>“I heard they were trained by their knight commander since they were baptized.”</p><p>That last comment caused several pairs of eyes to lock on Ferdinand, but he pointedly ignored them.</p><p>“Now then!” Aub Dunkelfelger said, stepping forward again as Wilfried dismissed his schtappe. “Those of you from Dunkelfelger, go to the dormitory and stand by.” He descended the stage and waved Lucius and Ferdinand over as he approached Trauerqual. After passing out sound-blocking tools, he addressed the king. “King Trauerqual, this is the acting Aub Ahrensbach. With the help of Ehrenfest, he put down the Lanzenavians in his duchy and brought their leader along with a few others to have their memories read.”</p><p>“I see,” the king said, his gaze darting back and forth between Ferdinand and Lucius, noting their similarities. “What of the gate?”</p><p>“I closed the duchy gate,” Lucius replied, “but the country gate is still open.” He gave Ferdinand a troubled look.</p><p>Sighing, he said, “It’s no secret that Rozemyne has her Wisdom anymore. She did not close the country gate as the duchy gate was closed, and she had not sought the zent’s permission.”</p><p>Trauerqual also sighed as he nodded. “The book remains lost for years, and now suddenly two people have it. That aside, there is much that we’ll need to discuss. While you defended Ahrensbach and closed the gate, it was your mana that allowed Raublut and the Lanzenavians to enter the Academy, putting Yurgenschmidt at risk.”</p><p>Lucius paled but nodded. “Yes, I… I am aware.”</p><p>“Aub Dunkelfelger, shall we observe the memories of the ones the acting Aub Ahrensbach brought?”</p><p>The aub nodded. “Yes, and we’ll need to talk with this key witness at the same time, I imagine.”</p><p>“Key witness?”</p><p>Lucius motioned to his knights, and they brought Gervasio over. Trauerqual froze as he blinked rapidly for a brief moment before he regained control of himself. “Adalgisa?”</p><p>“Indeed,” Aub Dunkelfelger answered.</p><p>Trauerqual sighed and held his forehead. “So he’s the king.”</p><p>Ferdinand crossed his arms as Lucius nodded.</p><p>“And he’s not bound because…?”</p><p>“Lanzenave has factions as well,” Ferdinand said. “The perpetrators, being of a different faction, acted separately. The answers to most questions can likely be gleaned from viewing their leader’s memories.”</p><p>“Well said!” Aub Dunkelfelger laughed. “Ever the seeker of efficiency! Come, King Trauerqual. Let us go view their memories. We shall bring the Lanzenave king with us as well. Ferdinand, Aub Ahrensbach, I would like both of you to be present.”</p><p>The look in his eye suggested he wanted to ensure Lucius couldn’t escape. Ferdinand was likely being asked to join them since he looked so much like Gervasio and Lucius, and he was a trusted third party. At least, that was his hope. There was just as great a chance that he was being treated as a suspect as well.</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger and King Trauerqual had Anastasius, Eglantine, Adolphine, and Magdalena head to the Small Hall. Then, the king sent his attendant to retrieve the memory tool, and the group of them went to the holding cells. Rozemyne was still there, speaking with Loyalitat. When they saw the king, everyone present dropped to a knee, but once again, Trauerqual almost immediately bade them stand.</p><p>“We will begin the questioning as soon as my attendant returns,” he said. “Lady Rozemyne, I must ask you to join the others in the Small Hall.”</p><p>She bowed in acknowledgment and left with the strike team, her knights, and her scholars. Ferdinand caught the look in Hartmut’s eye as he studied Gervasio once again on his way out. It seemed he had started piecing it together. The man was often too smart for his own good. Ferdinand would need to convince Rozemyne to take his name so they could ensure control of the fanatic, especially now that he likely held both their secrets.</p><p>Soon enough, the attendant returned, and Lucius identified Leonzio for Aub Dunkelfelger and King Trauerqual. The two of them disappeared into a room with the criminal, leaving Ferdinand, Lucius, Gervasio, and the gathered guard knights in the lobby. Justus stood at the edge of the room, his shining eyes itching with the need to learn about his master’s connection to the Lanzenavians, but that bit of curiosity would remain unsated. Ferdinand had no intention of willingly revealing his past to anyone but Rozemyne.</p><p>Eventually, the king came out of the room, his intense gaze focused on Lucius. “The three of you,” he said, indicating Ferdinand, Lucius, and Gervasio, “come. Everyone else, stay here.”</p><p>“But Your Highness–”</p><p>King Trauerqual waved his guard knight to silence.</p><p>They entered the room and found Leonzio laid out across a bench, bound and unconscious. On a table lay a leather bag that looked to be holding someone’s head, likely Raublut’s.</p><p>Rubbing his forehead, King Trauerqual said, “So you’re the king of Lanzenave, you’re his son, and you’re from Adalgisa, meaning you have a significant amount of royal blood.”</p><p>“I’m an archduke candidate of Ehrenfest,” Ferdinand said.</p><p>“You also hold Grutrissheit. Am I wrong?”</p><p>Ferdinand remained silent.</p><p>King Trauerqual continued to rub his forehead. “We can’t let this stand.”</p><p>Stepping forward, Aub Dunkelfelger said, “We’re in quite the conundrum here. A prince was sent to the distant heights as part of a plot where your mana was used to open a teleportation gate between Ahrensbach and Adalgisa.” He paused and pointed to Gervasio. “Raublut was going to use this opportunity to dethrone the current zent and have you take the country’s foundation. You can see how that is problematic.”</p><p>Lucius and Gervasio remained silent.</p><p>“I’m not concerned about Ferdinand,” Aub Dunkelfelger said. “If he had designs on the throne, he would have taken it long ago. What does concern me is his obvious connection to you two, and far too many people have witnessed it. We cannot quietly execute an acting aub. Anything we do will be noticed, and people are going to draw lines to Ferdinand one way or another.</p><p>“As if that weren’t enough, getting rid of you would put Ahrensbach in a tight spot. There is no one there able to replace you, and there aren’t many archduke candidates I would trust to take over. It would be bad if one of my family members took over, and I don’t trust most of the other duchies as far as I can throw them. I would give it to Ferdinand except he has made it clear that he doesn’t want it.”</p><p>Lucius raised a hand. “My apologies, but why are <em>you</em> the one talking about giving duchies away?”</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger snorted. “Ah, a courageous one, aren’t you? I have my Wisdom, and I will be dyeing the country foundation as soon as Dunkelfelger’s has been transferred.”</p><p>Lucius blinked. “So you’re the next zent.”</p><p>“Indeed, I am! And you have brought me quite a mess to sort out on my first day with the Grutrissheit. Quite a mess indeed. Honestly, I would have you both put in an Ivory Tower in someone’s duchy, but…” He gave Ferdinand a meaningful look and then shrugged. “This is not my preferred method to settle things, but we cannot move forward as it stands. We will need to view both of your memories.”</p><p>Lucius and Gervasio both gave resigned nods.</p><p>Raising his brow, Aub Dunkelfelger looked at Ferdinand and said, “You’ve been awfully quiet. I know from the letter you sent that you have an opinion on this.”</p><p>“Are you ordering me to give it?”</p><p>He frowned but nodded.</p><p>Sighing, Ferdinand tapped his temple and said, “Very well.” Everything in him wanted to swallow the words he was going to say next, but they were the wish of his all-goddess. Gritting his teeth, he said, “Acknowledge Lord Lucius as Aub Ahrensbach. Allow the Lanzenavians who have obtained citizenship to stay there. He already has their loyalty, and he’s earned that of the native Ahrensbach nobles.”</p><p>King Trauerqual glared at him. “And what of my son? Would you suggest his death go unpunished?”</p><p>“Prince Sigiswald’s death happened independently of Lord Lucius. It was his head guard knight who slew him, no? I assume he had a reason for doing so that had nothing to do with the Lanzenavians or Ahrensbach.”</p><p>The king frowned but didn’t deny it.</p><p>“He likely just finally had the excuse thanks to Raublut, the former Sovereign Knight Commander that you allowed to get away, who rallied a portion of your knights to his cause and led the Lanzenavians here. While it is true he took advantage of your ignorance to fake his death, you could say the same of Lady Georgine and Lord Lucius.”</p><p>“He gave his mana away to be used in such a manner,” King Trauerqual countered. “Any aub who did something so foolish would not be deserving of the seat.”</p><p>Ferdinand shrugged. “Is that not also a failing of your adoptive daughter? She was the one who taught the archduke candidate course, was she not? She should have also been aware of his supposed temple upbringing, meaning she should have expected him to lack a noble’s common sense. Why, then, did she not stress the importance of being careful with one’s mana?”</p><p>Gritting his teeth, the king looked away, anger clouding his expression.</p><p>“I am not suggesting your son’s death go unavenged,” Ferdinand said, “but should you not visit punishment upon those responsible, namely his guard knights? You’ve already slain Raublut who helped orchestrate it, and Lady Georgine, who planned it, was sent to the distant heights during her invasion of Ehrenfest. It seems to me your vengeance has already been mostly carried out.”</p><p>“This insolence…!”</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger shook his head. “No, no. I ordered him to give his opinion. The blame for his harshness should fall on me. That said, even if I read their memories and find them innocent, how can we be certain the Lanzenavians in Ahrensbach aren’t merely waiting for an opportunity?”</p><p>“The Shield of Schutzaria,” Ferdinand said. “King Trauerqual, did you not see for yourself how it can separate those with ill intent?”</p><p>He gave a reluctant nod.</p><p>Rubbing his chin, Aub Dunkelfelger said, “Rozemyne would probably have the mana to test every noble in Ahrensbach. I’d better find a way to solve this that won’t reflect badly on her fiancé, then. You may have been baptized as an archduke candidate of Ehrenfest, Ferdinand, but there is no denying your connection to these two. I’ll have to be careful. Regardless, we won’t be getting anywhere without reading some memories. Let’s do Lord Lucius first.”</p><p>Lucius let out a shaky breath and nodded, stepping forward to accept the magic tool. “Whatever decision you make,” he said as he was handed the tuning potion, “please, protect little Letizia. If anyone is truly innocent in all of this, it is her.”</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger nodded. “So long as she is to be adopted by the new Aub Ahrensbach, I think we can make that happen.”</p><p>Lucius let out a relieved sigh before draining his cup and lying down on the bench. The aub bent down and connected their minds.</p><p>Gervasio tensed as he watched his son’s memories get swept. Ferdinand wanted to scoff at him. The man was getting off lightly this weave. Even if he ended up executed, it was better than what had happened to him before. Such was the benefit of not siding with Raublut. Being in the same room as Gervasio still sickened him, however, regardless of the actions he did or didn’t take this time.</p><p>When the aub finally finished with Lucius, he had a complicated look on his face. Once Lucius came to, he swapped places with his father. As Aub Dunkelfelger leaned down, Lucius gave a violent shudder. “What a horrible experience,” he said.</p><p>“I wouldn’t know,” Ferdinand replied, though he’d come close. So very, very close. Had he not failed Rozemyne, he would have shown her his memories of her family and Lutz, exposing the dark feelings of loneliness and envy he kept locked away. He would have given her a choice afterwards - to become a commoner again and marry Lutz or whomever she wanted, to remain a noble and find someone else to marry, or to take him as her consort. How he dearly, dearly wanted her to choose the third option, but part of him was certain she’d choose the first. She had forgotten Lutz completely, proving he was an extremely important existence to her.</p><p>Now, Ferdinand knew she would choose him. She’d already done so multiple times, turning down overtures even from a prince as she professed her intention to make him her Dark God. This time, she wanted him as he wanted her, though he often couldn’t fathom why. It didn’t matter, though, so long as she was with him. He would never allow himself to be parted from her again.</p><p>Eventually, Aub Dunkelfelger stood and sighed heavily. “What a conundrum.”</p><p>“What is it?” King Trauerqual asked as Gervasio slowly began to blink as he woke.</p><p>Running a hand over his hair, the aub explained, “Neither one of them made any moves against Yurgenschmidt. In fact, both wanted to live here as law-abiding citizens while providing a place for their fellow nobles of Lanzenave to live peacefully. Therein lies my conundrum. They came here seeking asylum and, well, he may be a former god, but Ewaermen was clear about his purpose in creating Yurgenschmidt. It’s meant as a refuge for those with mana. He was the one who directed me to become Zent. I think forcing out the Lanzenavians seeking refuge would be going against the gods and the very foundation of Yurgenschmidt.”</p><p>Hope lit in Lucius’s eyes. “So you’ll allow them to stay?”</p><p>“I don’t see where I have much choice,” Aub Dunkelfelger sighed. It was a weak excuse in Ferdinand’s mind, but perhaps the aub revered the gods more than he did. “I’m certain, too, that if you get removed, those refugees won’t remain peaceful for long. It would likely cause them to panic, thinking they were going to be next, and we can’t afford to have a second rebellion in Ahrensbach. You’ve already lost too many nobles as it stands, and you’ve got several more to execute by the looks of it.”</p><p>Lucius looked away, his expression dark. “As much as I don’t want to, traitors have to be dealt with.”</p><p>“That they do,” the aub agreed. “King Gervasio here is innocent, too. If we keep Lord Lucius in place, albeit with a loyalty contract, I see no justification for executing or imprisoning him. This Leonzio fellow, on the other hand, deserves to get strung up in the jungle and left for the feybeasts to devour.”</p><p>King Trauerqual’s eyes darkened. “Perhaps I’ll do that very thing.”</p><p>Nodding to himself, Aub Dunkelfelger said, “Right, so Lord Lucius stays Aub Ahrensbach so that we don’t spurn the will of the gods and invite further chaos. Now that that is out of the way, let’s go have this meeting in the Small Hall to figure out the rest.”</p><p>With that, the five of them exited the interrogation chamber.</p>

<p>“Everyone is present. Let us begin,” King Trauerqual said. Sitting around the table were the first queen, Magdalena, Anastasius, Eglantine, Adolphine, Aub Dunkelfelger, Sieglinde, Sylvester, Florencia, Lucius, Gervasio, Rozemyne, and Ferdinand. “First and foremost,” Trauerqual said, “the Grutrissheit has been found.”</p><p>The news only surprised the two queens. Adolphine raised her brows slightly, but she had been aware Eglantine was searching for the book, so she likely assumed it would have been located sooner or later. Sylvester and Florencia both looked resigned, and Eglantine seemed full of self-recrimination. Ferdinand could dredge up no sympathy for the woman. She’d had years to complete the task but failed to do so. Whatever excuse she gave would not be good enough to make him overlook her incompetence.</p><p>“Hence,” Trauerqual continued, “I will cede control of this meeting to Aub Dunkelfelger, the holder of Grutrissheit and future Zent.”</p><p>“What?!” Magdalena cried, her face incredulous. “Werdekraf, what’s the meaning of this?! Do you truly mean to usurp my husband’s position?! Should you not deliver the Grutrissheit to him instead?!”</p><p>“Magdalena,” Trauerqual said, the censure heavy in his tone.</p><p>“What will become of our family?”</p><p>“Whatever he deems fit,” he snapped. “Do not show any further disrespect to our Zent.”</p><p>Her eyes burned as she looked at her brother but soon enough, her expression flattened.</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger got to his feet and stood at the head of the table. Sieglinde’s face was impassive, so Ferdinand couldn’t determine her feelings on the matter, but she had accepted the terms of the ditter, so she at least approved on some level, though he imagined she didn’t relish becoming the new first queen.</p><p>“We have much to discuss,” the aub said. “So much, in fact, that I don’t know where to even begin.” He looked to his wife who gave him a small nod. “Right, let’s start with recent events. Aub Ehrenfest, Lord Ferdinand, Lady Rozemyne, Aub Ahrensbach, and Lord Gervasio, I will ask you to supplement my account of events with any important details I’ve missed.”</p><p>When they all nodded, he said, “This started with Lady Georgine of Ahrensbach wanting to take Ehrenfest’s foundation.” With everyone’s help, he gave a brief summary of events, though he had to gloss over quite a few details. He chose not to mention anything about Adalgisa palace, Lucius’s true origins, or Ferdinand’s part in Aub Dunkelfelger obtaining his Wisdom. When he got to Sigiswald’s death, the first queen had to stifle a sob, but everyone pretended they didn’t notice. All of the royal family’s faces darkened except for Adolphine’s. She maintained her composure throughout the explanation.</p><p>“And so within the next few days, I will close Ahrensbach’s country gate,” Aub Dunkelfelger said. “Now, let’s talk about reparations and punishment. First and foremost, for the murder of Prince Sigiswald, his guard knights and Leonzio of Lanzenave will be executed. Those involved in the attack on the Royal Academy shall be executed as well. As far as those who attacked Ehrenfest or Ahrensbach, I will leave their punishment up to their respective aubs.”</p><p>Sylvester and Lucius both nodded.</p><p>“Now, Aub Ahrensbach,” he said, meeting Lucius’s eye, “there is no denying the role your duchy played in this mess. Ordinarily, the Ahrensbach archducal family would be executed, and a new family would be installed. However, I acknowledge that this was a plot executed by the former first wife and a foreign country and that you did your part to quell the fighting. You are also the only one left who can fulfill the role of Aub Ahrensbach, and there are few I would trust to take over. Therefore, you shall remain as aub, but you will cede a portion of your lands to Ehrenfest in compensation, and you will forfeit the lands from old Werkestock.”</p><p>Sylvester’s eyes widened, but he remained silent. Lucius, on the other hand, closed his with resignation and lowered his head. “Yes, Zent.”</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger blinked but then nodded. “Well, I’ll have to get used to the title sooner or later.” Just like that, the aub was done with the Lanzenave invasion. Ferdinand could appreciate his efficiency.</p><p>“Now,” Aub Dunkelfelger said, “let us discuss the royal family. As you might know from Dunkelfelger’s glorious history, there was once a Zent from my home duchy. He codified many of our ditter laws, though I’ve only known of them being used in matches with my duchy. I can’t imagine why other duchies haven’t taken advantage of them. What a wonderful way to settle disputes! Why, the whole business ten years ago could have been settled over a game of ditter, but–”</p><p>Sieglinde cleared her throat.</p><p>“Right. The point is that we had a Zent from Dunkelfelger because there was no royal family at the time.”</p><p>Everyone except Ferdinand and Rozemyne’s eyes widened, even Adolphine’s.</p><p>“What do you mean there was no royal family?” Magdalena asked.</p><p>“Exactly what I said,” he replied. “Allow me to tell you about the history of the royal family and how the actions of their ancestors have brought this country to the brink of ruin. Let us begin with the first Zent. He was High Bishop, not unlike the Saint of Ehrenfest.” He then gave a brief history of Yurgenschmidt, explaining how zents were chosen in the past, how the royal family came to be, and each action that was taken to strengthen the royal family’s stranglehold on the throne and how it negatively affected the country.</p><p>“The country's foundation hasn’t been dyed in hundreds of years!” the aub said. “What the royal family has been dyeing is the foundation to the Sovereignty duchy. Only the smallest portion of mana you’ve been supplying has been going to the country.”</p><p>The royal family’s faces paled. “So all this time…?” Anastasius asked.</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger nodded. “Indeed. You understand, then, why we need to dismantle the royal family and set up a new system to select zents. We shall return to the old ways, as decreed by the gods.”</p><p>“What will happen to us, then?” Magdalena asked. “Will you execute us? Throw us in the White Tower?”</p><p>Eglantine looked ready to pass out at the question.</p><p>He shook his head and replied, “No, no. For one thing, that would destabilize the country. We can’t have that. I’m not interested in fighting any more wars. We’re too strapped for mana as it is! Why, how long has it been since the Academy has seen treasure-stealing ditter because of the lack of nobles? Speed ditter has its place, of course - ditter is ditter, but the lack of treasure-stealing ditter is detrimental to the education of our students! Is it not, Lord Ferdinand?”</p><p>Ferdinand sighed inwardly. Of course he would pull him into this part of the conversation. “It is as you say. Scholars no longer create tools for ditter, so they do not know how to coordinate and strategize with knights, nor do they face the challenge of creating new or more effective tools to obtain victory. Newly graduated knights have no concept of coordination as speed ditter prioritizes efficiency over teamwork. They have to be retrained from the ground up in order to learn how to work with a team. They are weaker and far less able to concoct effective strategies.”</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger nodded. “Well said! Dunkelfelger and Ehrenfest keep coming first and second in the tournament because we hone our skills against each other in treasure-stealing ditter!”</p><p>That was completely untrue, but Ferdinand saw no point in contradicting the man.</p><p>“In order to preserve order so that we might be able to return to the glorious days of treasure-stealing ditter, I will have King Trauerqual serve me as a minister. You will officially be stepping aside for someone who holds Grutrissheit, and we will support each other’s positions. The country needs more suppliers, regardless. I believe that will lead to the least amount of disruption.”</p><p>That seemed to appease Magdalena somewhat. While she obviously wasn’t happy about losing her position, she seemed far more concerned with the fate of her family than the negligible power she held as third queen.</p><p>Running a hand over his hair, Aub Dunkelfelger said, “I will be redrawing the borders. I need a map of Yurgenschmidt.”</p><p>Since no scholars were present, there was no one to retrieve one. With a sigh, Ferdinand said, “Shall I create one for you?”</p><p>At the aub’s nod, he borrowed paper and a pen from Rozemyne and quickly sketched out the map.”</p><p>“Excellent! To be done so quickly and accurately!” the aub laughed. “As one would expect!” He placed the newly-drawn map in the center of the table and then sighed. “Before I state how the borders will change, I want to address the issue of Klassenberg.”</p><p>“Klassenberg?” Eglantine asked, perking up.</p><p>“It is because of Klassenberg we’re suffering from a mana and noble-shortage so severe we can’t even play treasure-stealing ditter at the Academy!” he declared. “Was it not Klassenberg who insisted on a sweeping purge? I’m sure there are numerous things we lost as a result besides!”</p><p>“The Underground Archive comes to mind,” Rozemyne said, her noble facade doing nothing to hide the dark emotions in her eyes.</p><p>Adolphine nodded her agreement. “All librarians must swear an oath of loyalty to Mestionora. Because the librarians from Werkestock could not swear loyalty to the Zent as a result, they were summarily executed, leaving a single mednoble in charge of the library. This meant that no one could access the Underground Archive until I at last came as the third archnoble librarian.”</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger narrowed his eyes. “What’s down there?”</p><p>“It’s where I learned how to make Verfuhremeer’s staff that I used in ditter,” Rozemyne said, placing a hand on her cheek.</p><p>“Ah, see!” the aub cried. “What an important resource needlessly denied to us for so long! We stand on the brink of ruin partially because of Klassenberg taking advantage of the civil war to eliminate their enemies. Therefore, not only will they drop in the rankings, but they will lose the lands they are currently managing. I will also have them return what used to be Eisenreich to Ehrenfest.”</p><p>This caused everyone, including Ferdinand, to stare at the man in shock.</p><p>Sylvester’s jaw dropped for just a moment before he mastered his expression again. “So you would make Ehrenfest a greater duchy?”</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>Ferdinand fought the urge to groan as he rubbed his temples. Ehrenfest would be taking in likely-unwilling nobles from both Klassenberg and Ahrensbach. The latter would be easy enough to control; he merely needed to remind them that they could have been part of a rebellious duchy, but instead, they were being treated as victors. Klassenberg nobles were a proud bunch, though, and they would see no justification for being taken from the first-ranked duchy and dropped into the sixth.</p><p>They would need to speak with Lucius and Aub Klassenberg about allowing those who wished to stay in their home duchies to move. What a headache this was all going to be.</p><p>“How do you plan to handle the backlash?” Eglantine asked. “Klassenberg will not accept this quietly.”</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger’s eyes hardened. “I will discuss it with Aub Klassenberg and ensure he understands the position he’s in.”</p><p>Which would do nothing, of course, to forestall any attempts to assassinate Aub Dunkelfelger. They wouldn’t make any open moves against someone with the support of the Sword of the Zent, but they’d done their fair share of poisonings in the past. After all, someone managed to assassinate the third prince’s entire family that way despite all the checks the food must have gone through.</p><p>Well, Ferdinand supposed if it came down to it, Aub Dunkelfelger could always put someone else in charge of Klasseberg. Aside from Ferdinand himself, the aub’s future son-in-law and daughter were viable options. After all, they would have completed the archduke candidate course within a couple of years. As much as Wilfried playing at being Aub Klasseberg terrified Ferdinand, it would be an effective way to ensure the duchy supported the Zent.</p><p>“I will turn the former Zausengas and Trostwerk into a single duchy along with the nearby land that used to be part of the Sovereignty.” Aub Dunkelfelger crossed his arms and sighed. “Prince Anastasius, I would like to ask you to be aub of the new duchy, but I’d like to see you at least engaged first. As of right now, you have no prospects, and that doesn’t bode well for a greater duchy that will need both suppliers and an heir to take over.”</p><p>Anastasius blinked at him in astonishment before he glanced over at Eglantine. He seemed to catch himself, however, and he quickly looked away. “I understand. How long do I have?”</p><p>“Until the Archduke Conference.”</p><p>“Very well. I shall endeavor to meet your expectations.”</p><p>“Good. If you get desperate, you can always play a bride taking ditter.”</p><p>Sieglinde cleared her throat again, and Aub Dunkelfelger returned his focus to the meeting at large. “Dunkelfelger will absorb the part of old Werkestock that it’s currently managing. Now, let’s talk about Drewanchel.” He gave Adolphine a meaningful look as she sat up straighter. The aub pointed to the map and said, “I’ll give Drewanchel all the land next to the duchy that used to be part of the Sovereignty. That should appease them.”</p><p>Adolphine nodded. “Yes, considering their only reward from their part in the civil war was having me join the royal family, they will need something material. They also won’t be losing all the influence they’ve gained through me. After all, I will still be a librarian at the Royal Academy.”</p><p>“Lucky…” Rozemyne muttered under her breath.</p><p>Ferdinand shot her a look, but she ignored him.</p><p>“And that leaves the part of old Werkestock that Ahrensbach was managing and the rest of the Sovereignty,” Aub Dunkelfelger said. “As a reward for your contributions, I will have you become aub of this new duchy, Lord Ferdinand.”</p><p>Everyone’s eyes widened, including Ferdinand’s. Was he actually getting a second chance to fulfill his promise to Rozemyne?</p><p>But that would mean spending the next two years separated from her.</p><p>He looked at his fiancée to gauge her reaction. Her noble mask was firmly in place, but he could read the tension in the way she clasped her hands in her lap. Her expression seemed to say, <em>I don’t want to be apart from you.</em></p><p>Turning back to the aub, he asked, “May I have just a moment?”</p><p>At his nod, Ferdinand passed Rozemye a sound-blocking tool and lifted his cape so no one could read their lips. It was highly inappropriate, but short of leaving the room, it was the only viable option he had.</p><p>Rozemyne, having received Elvira’s education, knew what it meant to be covered by a man’s cape, and she blushed furiously. However, she didn’t let it steal her focus entirely. “Ferdinand,” she said, “we’d be separated until our starbind!”</p><p>“Not necessarily,” he said. “Recall that fiancés travel to their new duchies ahead of time.”</p><p>“Yes, a <em>season</em> ahead. At best, I could move next summer since I’ll be at the Academy and wouldn’t be able to do any of the necessary preparations before the Archduke Conference.”</p><p>Ferdinand grimaced. “True.” Having lived a year and a half in Ahrensbach had made him temporarily forget that fact.</p><p>“That’s not even our only concern,” she said. “Ehrenfest is expanding a lot, and losing both of us and all our retainers on top of gaining new territory will definitely cause turmoil. It’s going to be unstable enough as it is without the duchy losing us.”</p><p>“We may never get another chance to build Alexandria,” Ferdinand said.</p><p>Rozemyne puffed out her cheeks a little. “I know, and taking part of Werkestock is probably better than Ahrensbach, anyway. True, there won’t be any seafood, but they were the duchy that supplied the most librarians. I’m certain they’ll be receptive to making a library city!”</p><p>He resisted the urge to flick her forehead. “Regardless, I doubt Aub Dunkelfelger will allow us to turn him down. He needs allies, and having us ruling over a greater duchy will help expand his power base and influence.”</p><p>“I understand his reasoning,” Rozemyne said. “I just wish the timing were better.”</p><p>“Hmm… That may be the one thing we can change,” Ferdinand muttered.</p><p>Rozemyne’s eyes gleamed like a predator that just spotted its prey taking a nap. “Let’s negotiate.”</p><p>After seeing her in action and hearing about the result of her negotiations with the royal family, Ferdinand was more than willing to let his little gremlin loose.</p><p>He dropped his cape and found the room staring at him with various levels of incredulity, though Sylvester’s expression had a hint of resignation and Magdalena’s a touch of disbelief.</p><p>What else did they expect him to do? How long would it take attendants to set up a meeting room somewhere in the Academy? This was the most efficient option. It was obvious they were having a discussion, not engaging in inappropriate behaviors.</p><p>“Aub Dunkelfelger,” he said, deciding to ignore the fools around him, “I would like to request a private meeting to discuss this new duchy.”</p><p>The aub laughed. “As expected of the Lord of Evil! We can always trust you to take ditter stakes seriously! Very well. We shall talk. It would be best to settle this before we move on.”</p><p>“I will have my attendant prepare a room,” Trauerqual said.</p><p>“Mine will assist,” Ferdinand replied. He would never allow a room to be prepared completely by a stranger.</p><p>Eventually, Ferdinand, Rozemyne, Lady Sieglinde, and Aub Dunkelfelger gathered around a small tea table in a side room.</p><p>“You’ll become Aub of the new duchy,” Aub Dunkelfelger led. “What is there to discuss?”</p><p>Rozemyne asked, “And this is a reward for our contributions?”</p><p>“Indeed! Obtaining your own foundation! Just like with real ditter!”</p><p>Rozemyne placed a hand on her cheek and sighed. “You would ask us to rule over an abandoned territory whose people attacked the royal family and used darkness-imbued weapons on Ehrenfest’s lands and call it a reward?”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“How do you think they will react to two archduke candidates from Ehrenfest who stood opposed to the leader of their faction suddenly taking over? This is far more akin to being handed a mess to clean up than a reward, wouldn’t you agree?”</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>Rozemyne shook her head. “I understand your reasoning. We will, of course, support you as Zent and get the unruly elements under control. However, if you truly wish for this to be a reward, perhaps you would consider easing the burden a bit?”</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger laughed. “I see! I see! Very well, then! I shall listen to your requests.”</p><p>With a smile, Rozemyne said, “First, you understand how essential we are to Ehrenfest, the duchy your daughter is moving to, no? You have just given us quite a bit of new land to manage, and losing the two of us and our retinues will greatly hinder Aub Ehrenfest’s ability to work through the early stages of assimilation. As such, I would like to request that we stay in Ehrenfest for one year to assist with this transition. This will also give us time to prepare to move.”</p><p>The aub snorted. “You keep saying ‘us,’ but are you not an underaged archduke candidate? You will be in Ehrenfest for at least the next two years. I see no reason to leave a territory abandoned for a full year when you will remain behind and be able to offer all the assistance needed.”</p><p>“I will not go without Rozemyne,” Ferdinand declared.</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger looked at him for a moment and sighed. “Even Ewigeliebe must tolerate being separated from Geduldh most of the year. The time you will spend apart is short.”</p><p>“So you would have me supply the foundation of a greater duchy alone?”</p><p>“Are you saying you couldn’t?” the aub shot back.</p><p>Ferdinand narrowed his eyes. The aub was uncharacteristically unbending. He put up less of a fight when they discussed his becoming Zent. As Ferdinand tried to determine the man’s motives, he noticed the fire in his stern eyes and fought back a groan.</p><p>This fool was angling for a ditter! He would do his best to deny any request so that they would be forced to set them as stakes.</p><p>It seemed Rozemyne had come to the same conclusion as she placed a hand on her cheek again. “My, Aub Dunkelfelger. It seems there is a misconception here we must address. I am well aware of the fact that we could make all of our demands stakes for ditter. However, please recall that you are talking to the Lord of Evil. Do you think he would hold back when deciding our stakes? Make no mistake - we would absolutely win.” Ferdinand shot her a glare. Was she <em>trying</em> to force the ditter to happen? “You would have no choice, then, but to bend to our demands,” she continued, unperturbed. “Keep in mind that, once again, you are speaking with the Lord of Evil who is capable of hiding all manner of meaning behind seemingly innocuous words. What you think you might be agreeing to in a ditter contract would likely only scratch the surface of the actual stake. However, you can maintain more control if you negotiate with us in good faith.”</p><p>“But-“</p><p>“Werdekraf.”</p><p>The aub froze as his wife called his name.</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne is correct,” she said. “This is the man who made you Zent overnight through one of the fastest games of treasure-stealing ditter ever played, and he had no time to prepare for the stakes or the game itself beforehand. I have no doubt that he will craft truly unthinkable demands whose consequences can only be guessed at if you push to solve this through ditter.</p><p>“That aside, as you stated before, this is meant as a reward. Forcing them to ditter over the details will only put more of a burden on them, and Ehrenfest may well not offer its support in preparations to someone leaving their duchy.”</p><p>The last part was completely untrue; Sylvester would absolutely offer his support, but there was no need to point that out.</p><p>“We will reap the most benefit with the least pain by negotiating,” Sieglinde concluded.</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger slumped in his chair with a defeated sigh. “I see. So even as Zent, there are those who will deny me a ditter.” Soon enough, he gathered himself and said, “I understand your unwillingness to supply a foundation alone. However, there is little alternative.”</p><p>Ferdinand sighed. “To think you would retaliate in such a way for your loss last night. This is a most horrific punishment.”</p><p>“Retaliate? Punishment?!” he yelled.</p><p>“What else could you call forcing someone to supply an entire duchy’s foundation by himself for two years? Even Aub Ahrensbach has a second supplier, young though she may be. It is far more than I would have.”</p><p>The aub blinked several times before he burst out into laughter again. “I see! Very well, then! I believe you have just done me a favor, Ferdinand! As expected of the Lord of Evil!”</p><p>Ferdinand raised a brow at him.</p><p>“If supplying the foundation alone is punishment, then I shall dole it out! My new minister, the aub of the other new duchy I’m creating, and the people of Ahrensbach will all desire to see Lanzenave suffer some form of retribution for their failed invasion, and Leonzio’s execution isn’t enough to sate them. It’s over too quickly compared to the suffering those who lost the civil war have endured for the past several years. Therefore, you, Ferdinand, shall dye the foundation of your new duchy, and the king of Lanzenave shall alone supply it until Rozemyne at last joins you.”</p><p>Ferdinand nearly leapt from his chair. “You would have me live under the same roof as that man? How is that any less of a punishment for me?” he demanded.</p><p>Raising his brows in surprise, Aub Dunkelfelger sat back in his chair and studied him. After several long moments, he muttered, “I see.”</p><p>“Aub Dunkelfelger,” Rozemyne said, “might we compromise on this? Perhaps Ferdinand could return to Ehrenfest after he dyes the foundation.”</p><p>He shook his head. “I can’t leave the duchy leaderless for two years. Lord Gervasio would become the de facto aub, making your transition to power even more problematic than you claim it already will be.”</p><p>“Then how about this?” she asked. “Allow Ferdinand to stay in Ehrenfest for one year, and then we can both go to the new duchy. Lord Gervasio can then be returned to Ahrensbach.”</p><p>He held his chin and hummed. “No, that’s too long. I can give you two seasons, and even that is pushing it.”</p><p>“Two?” Rozemyne asked, pushing her finger into her cheek as she thought. Ferdinand’s stomach was sinking further the longer this conversation continued. Perhaps he should just challenge him to ditter. To think Rozemyne would let the negotiations veer so far out of control. “You would be depriving Ehrenfest of the most brilliant knight commander in its history right before the Lord of Winter hunt, but very well. I shall accompany him, then. There will inevitably be chaos amongst the students at the Royal Academy their first year as members of a new duchy. Having an archduke candidate present will stop most problems before they start, and I’ll be able to handle any others that arise.”</p><p>“Ah, I didn’t think of that,” the aub said as he crossed his arms. “Yes, I see. It would indeed be advantageous to have you present during the academic term. Still, to send an archduke candidate so far ahead of their starbind…”</p><p>“Oh?” Rozemyne asked. “But won’t I be an archduke candidate of the new duchy in this case?”</p><p>“Ha! I see! Very well, then!” the aub agreed. “The king of Lanzenave shall supply the foundation alone for two seasons before the new aub returns in winter.”</p><p>Aub. Ferdinand wanted to scoff. He never once wanted to be Aub. In fact, he’d spent both weaves avoiding taking on that role, and now it was being forcibly thrust upon him as a “reward.” True, he would have ended up doing the vast majority of the work associated with the position in the previous weave, especially while Rozemyne was at the Academy, but that was quite different from actually having the title. Still, it would allow him to remain with Rozemyne, and he knew he could prepare his move in the given timeframe. He’d had roughly the same amount of time in the previous weave, after all.</p><p>“That isn’t very long for a punishment given the severity of the crime,” Sieglinde said. “Lord Gervasio should remain in the new duchy as a supplier until Lady Rozemyne comes of age. Even that is too little.”</p><p>“No,” Ferdinand said, leaving no room for misinterpretation. “I do not want to be in the same duchy as that man.”</p><p>Rozemyne shifted her legs slightly to draw closer to him before reaching out the pinky of the hand on her knee towards him. It brought to mind the time when he had done similar for her during a meeting in Sylvester’s office, and he gratefully linked his finger with hers, taking comfort in the tiny bit of warmth it provided.</p><p>“Can you not simply put him in the White Tower with schtappe-sealing cuffs?” Sieglinde asked.</p><p>Ferdinand would have preferred to destroy the man’s schtappe rather than seal it. “I do not want him in my duchy,” he repeated.</p><p>“Shall we send him to the temple in Ahrensbach, then?” she asked.</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger shook his head. “No, we cannot use the temple as punishment or a place of debauchery anymore. All temples must be cleansed and their reputations restored.”</p><p>Sieglinde, who had seen the effects of a reformed temple with her own eyes, nodded.</p><p>“We can return him to Ahrensbach but have him send feystones to supply the foundation.”</p><p>Imagining taking feystones from the man who had told him, “Those who were born as feystones should become feystones,” sent a horrible chill down his spine and made his throat convulse. Somehow, it seemed an even worse alternative to having to see Gervasio’s face every day. The aub knew of his past. Could he not understand Ferdinand’s wish to avoid constant reminders of it?</p><p>“I will gladly accept the feystones and use them when I supply the foundation,” Rozemyne said. Ferdinand shot her pleading glance, but her look said, <em>It will be okay. Let me take care of everything. You won’t even have to see them.</em> How ironic that she would feel the need to protect him from seeing feystones in this weave. “With this arrangement, he can continue to give his mana for many more years. Shall we say until after I’ve weaned my last child?”</p><p>Sieglinde nodded, a small smile on her lips. “That sounds reasonable. It will be a great boon to you to have that support while you are providing for your child.”</p><p>“Very well!” Aub Dunkelfelger said. “Now that negotiations have concluded–”</p><p>“‘Concluded?’” Rozemyne asked. “We’re just getting started. All we decided was the timing of our move.”</p><p>“There’s more?!” he cried.</p><p>“Well, yes,” she said, placing a hand on her cheek. “Most matters can be settled between duchies, but there are other matters that will require your approval as Zent.”</p><p>Ferdinand narrowed his eyes at her, trying to determine what else she was attempting to gain. He understood the concept of profiting as much as she could, but most of the terms the previous Rozemyne extracted from Sigiswald weren’t relevant here.</p><p>“First,” she said, “Ehrenfest already has a low population, and it's losing several of its nobles in less than a year. As such, please make it so people have to marry into Ehrenfest for the next five years. I would ask you to do the same for our duchy as great change such as this is unsettling and may drive many outstanding nobles to seek opportunities to leave.”</p><p>The aub shrugged. “Easy enough. Now–”</p><p>“Also,” she said, cutting him off, “as already stated, the librarians from Werkestock were unjustly executed for not being able to break their oaths to Mestionora. This crime against humanity has cost a generation of archdukes and archduke candidates to lose access to the Underground Archive along with countless books that were never returned after being borrowed. Who knows how many important documents have been lost because a single mednoble could not supply the magic tools necessary to preserve them?</p><p>“As most of the librarians at the time came from Werkestock, it is evident that they value literature as the crystallizations of knowledge passed down through the ages. In recognition of this passion and the severe loss the country suffered as a result of the unjust purge, I want to establish our new duchy as a national repository for printed communication.”</p><p>“What?” all three of the adults in the room asked.</p><p>Rozemyne nodded, her eyes practically glowing. “Look at everything that was lost because of changes to the personnel at the Royal Academy! To circumvent this in the future, a copy of all printed materials must be sent to our new duchy to be properly preserved. Materials will be freely available to the public so long as they sign an agreement to return them lest they face grave consequences.”</p><p>Ferdinand could well imagine what those grave consequences would entail. Rubbing his temples, he said, “Rozemyne, there are certain ‘crystallizations of knowledge’ that are not meant for the public eye. There is a reason only archdukes and archduke candidates can enter the Underground Archive.”</p><p>“Fine,” she said. “We shall create our own Underground Archive for such things, but the vast majority of materials should be readily available to any seeking them. There’s no reason for most of the items kept in the Underground Archive at the Royal Academy to be hidden away. Things like effective compression methods should be shared, especially now in this mana drought. Let’s not forget the instructions for building the stage that allows Ehrenfest nobles to summon spring. The people of Klassenberg could greatly benefit from that, too. There are so many things that have no reason to be withheld from the public.”</p><p>He should have known letting her have free reign would result in something like this. Even with a noble education, a gremlin was a gremlin. He couldn’t hope to control this rampage.</p><p>Sieglinde raised a brow as she placed a hand on her cheek. “So you would control the vast majority of the information in Yurgenschmidt?”</p><p>Shaking her head, Rozemyne said, “The entire point is to <em>not</em> control it. Is the country not on the brink of destruction because the royal family hid away certain writings and corrupted public perception of religious rituals and the temple? Think about it. The content that can be read in the High Bishop’s bible is limited by the High Bishop’s mana and attributes. By reducing the importance of the temple and ensuring only low-manaed nobles are placed there, no one would be able to read the entire bible. There’s a magic circle at the beginning that talks about Zent selection, but I’m the only High Bishop in hundreds of years who’s been able to see it. By having a public institution not controlled by the Center, we can ensure the mistakes of the royal family are not repeated.</p><p>“Of course, I’m not saying our duchy must be the only repository. Another copy of printed materials can be sent to the Royal Academy library or another centralized library that can be constructed on the grounds. However, I believe allowing our duchy to be a repository will go a long way in making the people more amenable to your rule.”</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger slowly nodded. “I see. I see. Two repositories designated by magic contract between the Zent and Aub would ensure neither would try to repeat the mistakes of the past. We would need all other aubs to sign a contract as well to agree to send copies of their books to both the Royal Academy and your duchy. In exchange, however…”</p><p>Ferdinand’s stomach dropped.</p><p>“I want a personal agreement for us to ditter every year after the Archduke Conference! We can start in three years with the first one celebrating your starbind! I will allow the other archduke candidates of Ehrenfest to participate as well, of course. I’ll never turn down the opportunity to face my future son-in-law on the ditter field!”</p><p>Ferdinand sighed heavily and pinched the bridge of his nose.</p><p>“For how long?”</p><p>“Rozemyne!” Ferdinand hissed. “Do not entertain this nonsense!”</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger laughed and said, “Ah, trying to up the stakes, are you, Ferdinand? How about this? I will ensure you get shipments of rare materials from Dunkelfelger delivered to you during the conference. Call it a participation prize. We will ditter for as long as we are both physically and financially able.”</p><p>Ferdinand grit his teeth as he tapped the side of his head.</p><p>“What about feybeasts and feyplants?” Rozemyne asked. “Could you provide those as well?”</p><p>“Of course! That won’t be an issue!”</p><p>He glanced at Sieglinde, hoping she would put an end to this foolishness, but she sat placidly. From her perspective, a ditter a year was likely not even worth mentioning.</p><p>He had to admit, however, having access to rare materials and new feybeasts and feyplants to study did sound appealing. If only Dunkelfelger bordered the ocean, then he might be able to obtain feyfish as well. There was some concern that the new plants wouldn’t thrive, but he’d managed to get the flammerzung fruits to germinate, so he wasn’t too worried about it. Plus, he had already been willing to live in a library city so long as he had research facilities attached. At least this time, he was getting mostly-free specimens he otherwise wouldn’t be able to obtain. Ditter was an annoyance, but he’d already been promised the spoils whether he won or lost. At no point did Aub Dunkelfelger say he had to take the game seriously.</p><p>“Continue delivering a book a year to Rozemyne and introduce her to any promising writers found in the Center or Dunkelfelger.”</p><p>Even with the effort she put into maintaining her facade, the look in her eyes still nearly killed him. He would have to avoid being alone with her for a while until she calmed down.</p><p>“Very well!” the aub said. “Consider the matter concluded! We shall draw up the contracts at a later date. For now, I believe we’ve kept everyone else waiting long enough.”</p><p>They returned to the Small Hall where it appeared everyone had been waiting in tense silence. Once everyone was seated again, the aub announced the results of their negotiations, including the personal agreement to ditter since he’d decided to let Wilfried and Charlotte participate, though he left the stakes out of the conversation. Sylvester gave Ferdinand a betrayed look as though saying, <em>First you abandon me, and then you drag my children into this insane bargain?</em> Ferdinand merely shrugged in response. If he wanted to blame anyone, it should have been Rozemyne who led the discussion.</p><p>Gervasio looked somewhat pale but resigned. He’d left Lanzenave hoping to escape his life as a glorified source of mana only to be thrust into the role for a duchy he would receive no benefit from for the foreseeable future. Even Ferdinand couldn’t guess when Rozemyne would determine she was finished having children, as terrifying as the thought was. Lucius looked just as grave, likely having depended on his father to help supply Ahrensbach for the past season.</p><p>“Now then! On to other matters!” Aub Dunkelfelger said. “First, let’s discuss how we will publicize that the royal family nearly brought this country to ruin.”</p>

<p>“What are you saying, Werdekraf?!” Magdalena exclaimed. “Will that not make us targets of the entire country’s ire? If you wish for our executions, simply have done with it.”</p><p>“Magdalena!” Trauerqual snapped.</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger raised a hand. “I mean to do no such thing, but I cannot permit the mistakes of the past to be repeated in the future due to ignorance. The rest of the country needs to understand why we are suddenly shifting to a new method for selecting the Zent.” He leaned back in his chair and crossed his arms. “I wish to present this information in a way that will have as little negative effect on the current royal family as possible. It will not do to have so much negative sentiment against my new minister and an aub of a greater duchy who will, I’m sure, be offering me his support.”</p><p>Anastasius nodded.</p><p>“The easiest way would be to paint the current royal family as victims, no?” Rozemyne asked, drawing all eyes to her. “It’s no secret Zent Trauerqual was not raised for the position he holds and that he doesn’t have the true Grutrissheit. The actions that put the country in its current predicament were carried out by his ancestors. Not only did he have no way of knowing the truth, but he willingly stepped aside the moment it was revealed. Portray him, then, as a caretaker waiting for one with true Wisdom, one who wishes to return to the old ways and right the wrongs of his ancestors. His support will be vital as you transition into rule, too, will it not?”</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger nodded. “It’s not a bad plan. How would you disseminate the information?”</p><p>“Picture books!”</p><p>Ferdinand furrowed his brows at her, but that just made her puff out her sizable chest as she began to tout the virtues of her invention. “Ehrenfest’s students perform so well on their written exams in part because of the picture books we produce. Dunkelfelger has purchased some as well, no? I’m sure you’ve seen the effectiveness of them firsthand. The Sovereignty, Dunkelfelger, Drewanchel, Klassenberg, and Ehrenfest all have printing industries established, and our new duchy will within the next two years. We can have all of them work to produce picture books to send to every duchy for children to learn about the true history of Yurgenschmidt. The information can be tested at the Royal Academy as part of history classes, perhaps third year? I would discuss the exact timing with the instructors. In the meantime, we can write a book for adults with more details. The first copies would be distributed to aubs and subsequent copies could be made available for purchase, but the picture books would be given free of charge. Naturally, as it is in the best interest of the country for this information to be spread far and wide from a trusted source, the Zent would mostly fund the endeavor.”</p><p>Ferdinand held back the urge to sigh and pinch the bridge of his nose. “And just how much would this endeavor cost?”</p><p>She pressed her finger into her cheek as she tilted her head in thought. “It’s hard to say without specifying how many volumes the picturebooks would be, but I’d think we could get all the most important information done in five. Counting the artist’s commission, the cost of materials and labor… I think we could do it for as low as six large silvers per picture book since this wouldn’t be done for profit. The aub’s copies would probably be about one small gold.”</p><p>Everyone gaped at her.</p><p>“And you’re suggesting giving a copy to each noble?” Anastasius asked.</p><p>Rozemyne shook her head. “Of course not. One per household should be the goal. Replacement copies would be sold at two small golds, so most people should take very good care of them.”</p><p>Good gods, this was worse than when she demanded Sigiswald give her an entire library! She would bankrupt the country long before they had a chance to save it.</p><p>“We could start with, say, ten copies to lesser duchies up to twenty-five copies for greater duchies. The greater duchies would be responsible for offsetting the cost of the picture books more than the lesser ones.”</p><p>“That would be nine large golds just for the greater duchies!” Ferdinand protested.</p><p>She shrugged. “That’s not that much considering the value of the picture books, is it? You can ask the greater duchies to pay half the cost, can’t you? That would only cost the Zent four large golds and five small golds. The books can be kept in their winter playrooms. If we make fifteen copies for middle duchies, that’s only eight large golds and one small gold. They can pay a quarter of the cost. Sending ten each to the lesser duchies would only be four large golds and two small golds, and they can pay a tenth. That totals…” Rozemyne began drawing numbers in the air as she muttered to herself. “Fourteen large golds, three small golds, five large silvers, and five small silvers for the first volume of the picture books. Even with the aubs’ books, that’s less than the cost of translating that one volume of Dunkelfelger history into modern language. Really, I can’t emphasize how great of a deal this is.”</p><p>“A-and there will be four more volumes?” Trauerqual asked, his face pale.</p><p>Rozemyne shrugged. “That’s only a guess. We won’t know until the text is written and the art created. The actual cost of production may vary somewhat as well as I’m not certain how the printing industry is faring in other duchies. Since the Sovereignty is being split between Drewanchel, Prince Anastasius, and our duchy, the industry may end up being split as well. This may not be much of a problem for Drewanchel, which already has printing, and our new duchy, which will have the person who started it, but I’m not sure how it will affect the parts that end up with Prince Anastasius. Did Klassenberg spread the industry to former Zausengas? What about the Sovereignty to former Trostwerk? The answers to these questions will greatly affect his duchy’s ability to print and thus will affect the cost.”</p><p>Crossing his arms again, Aub Dunkelfelger looked at Trauerqual and said, “We’ll discuss the country’s finances later, but that is a ridiculously affordable price for those picture books.”</p><p>The king nodded. “I cannot argue with that. I believe it is a cost the country can bear.”</p><p>“Excellent!” the aub yelled. “When can the aub’s books be ready?”</p><p>“By the Archduke Conference next year, I would imagine,” Rozemyne said.</p><p>He nodded again and said, “Yes, as one would expect. To have so many books ready so quickly. Printing truly is a marvel! Seeing so many of my people holding copies of the first volume of <em>A Ditter Story</em> with my son’s illustrations recreated so faithfully! It was enough to bring a tear to my eye!”</p><p>“First volume…?” Rozemyne asked.</p><p>“Of course! Surely your writer was more than inspired enough to write several more after the wondrous ditters we’ve shared!”</p><p>She gave the aub a noble smile, but Ferdinand could practically hear her shouting apologies to Roderick.</p><p>“Now then, let’s discuss other important details,” he said. “First, we need to talk about the temple. In most places, it is a filthy place that is a dishonor to the gods. A delegation from Ehrenfest helped to start the clean up at Dunkelfelger’s temple, and many of us, myself included, have learned how to summon Leidenschaft’s spear by praying and donating our mana to it in the temple. The joint research between Dunkelfelger and Ehrenfest proved the importance of prayer and religious rituals, as the followup research with Ehrenfest and Klassenberg confirmed the year after. We must have the temples throughout the country cleaned out and their original purpose restored.</p><p>“To that end, I will follow in the footsteps of the first Zent and become High Bishop of the Central Temple, which will be relocated here along with the royal residence. All of the religious ceremonies that have taken place here, including the prayer at graduation performed by the Ehrenfest archduke candidates, should have proven to everyone the need to perform the temple’s rituals here on Academy grounds. Within the next fifteen years, all High Bishops throughout the country will be archduke candidates as well, especially as they hold the key to each duchy’s foundation.”</p><p>“What?!” half the room exploded. It did not pass some of their notice that those from Ehrenfest didn’t react to the news.</p><p>“Indeed!” Aub Dunkelfelger said. “In fact, the current High Bishop of the Central Temple has the key to the country’s foundation, which is no small part of why I will assume the role. I will share this true path with all the archdukes at the Archduke Conference.”</p><p>“I would wait until the end,” Sylvester said, speaking up for the first time. “Otherwise, everyone will be itching to run home to secure the path.”</p><p>The aub laughed. “Indeed! You speak from experience, no doubt. I wonder just what else Ehrenfest is hiding.”</p><p>Contrary to Ferdinand’s expectations, Sylvester didn’t shrink back. Instead, he gave a shrug. “I can assure you most of the secrets are leaving next winter. Perhaps you can extract them as ditter stakes,” he said, sending his little brother a smug smile.</p><p>“Oh! What a brilliant idea!”</p><p>Damn him! Now Ferdinand would have to win every ditter he played against the new Zent. He’d have to think of proper stakes to offset his frustration.</p><p>“Very well, then. We shall reveal the path and the requirement to have either the archduke or an archduke candidate as High Bishop within the next fifteen years on the last day of the conference, right after the Dedication Ritual. Now, I can’t guarantee I’ll have the country foundation by then, but if I am no longer Aub Dunkelfelger at the time of the Archduke Conference, I would at least like to be the High Bishop and lead the ritual. We have to set a proper example, after all.”</p><p>Ferdinand expected those from Ehrenfest to take no issue with his statement, but he was surprised to see Lucius and Gervasio emphatically agreeing. Lucius had barely known anything about the gods of Yurgenschmidt before he arrived, and he’d have faced some level of social rejection for his “temple upbringing,” as Ferdinand himself could attest. How the man had developed a positive attitude towards the temple was beyond him.</p><p>While Eglantine was readily accepting of Aub Dunkelfelger’s declaration, and Adolphine studied him as though he were a new research specimen, the rest of the royal family showed various levels of shock. It was one thing to recognize the importance of religious rituals and participate in them; it was another entirely to become a part of the temple. Despite the aub’s best efforts, Ferdinand didn’t see the underlying stigma disappearing anytime soon.</p><p>Perhaps if they made the mandatory class for boys after developing mana sensing take place at the Royal Academy rather than the temple, that would curb the negative views for younger generations. For that matter, they could offer a similar class for girls rather than relying on their mothers to educate them. He imagined more than one woman entered her marital bed chamber completely clueless because her noble mother was too embarrassed to discuss winter with her daughter. The Rozemyne of the previous weave would have likely been among them having had her ladies’ education completely overlooked.</p><p>He wasn’t sure if he was glad that had changed this weave or not given Rozemyne’s utterly shameless behavior. Well, at least she wouldn’t announce to the future Zent that he and she would “merely need to summon winter” this time.</p><p>“Now, let’s discuss getting the Grutrissheit.” Everyone perked up at this, including Ferdinand. “In the past, all archdukes obtained their Wisdom and used it to help fill the gates, which in turn helped fill the country’s foundation. In order to obtain it, however, you must have all seven attributes <em>before</em> you obtain your schtappe. I believe I can count on one hand how many current aubs will be able to get the book, and nearly all of them are in this room.” He looked at Anastasius. “In fact, if you marry someone with the qualifications, I would suggest letting her become aub.”</p><p>Anastasius’s face flushed, and Eglantine looked away to hide her own blush. Everyone in the room knew there were only three female archduke candidates with the qualifications to gain their wisdom, and one was engaged while another was slated to become archduchess.</p><p>The young man quickly got his reaction under control, but not before guilt flashed across his face. Likely, he was cursing himself for thinking of courting just a day after his brother climbed the towering staircase. With a sigh, Ferdinand wondered if he’d be able to pull himself together enough to even try to find a suitable wife before the next conference. Ferdinand doubted he would be able to do it were Sylvester the one who’d been assassinated. Granted, nothing he had done in either weave could be counted as proper courting despite having been engaged three - technically four - times, so he was perhaps a poor example.</p><p>Still, Anastasius was a royal, raised to put duty above himself. He’d likely find a way to pull through. Ferdinand mildly hoped it wasn’t with Eglantine, however. Klassenberg was already going to be problematic being taken down to a middle duchy. Having a related aub in a greater duchy on their border, regardless of the canceled adoption, would not lead to a good outcome.</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger’s loud voice drew Ferdinand back to the conversation. “We now know that prayer and mana dedication can raise one's attributes, so it’s a good thing we’ve already moved schtappe acquisition to fourth year after the Divine Protection ritual. I would prefer to see it even later, but we already had that argument not too long ago, and I see no reason to have it again. I will, however, reveal the need for archduke candidates to obtain a seven-colored schtappe and give them the option to postpone schtappe acquisition up to their final year if they wish to obtain all seven elements first. This will likely mean that they will have to study in the offseason to catch up on any training they’ve missed, but what’s a season or two of extra study compared to obtaining the base qualification to get the Grutrissheit? We’ll let them repeat the Divine Protection ritual twice a year until they get their schtappes as well - once at the beginning and once at the end of the term.</p><p>“I will also reveal the path to the Grutrissheit at the conference along with a map of the known locations of the shrines. While the knowledge of the smaller shrines was lost, it is included within the pages of the Grutrissheit. Some have been destroyed, so we will make rebuilding them a priority going forward.”</p><p>“Will you allow archdukes the chance to try to obtain their Wisdom?” Eglantine asked.</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger shook his head. “I will offer no special chances to current archdukes. If they wish to pursue it during their time here at the conference or the Interduchy Tournament, they are free to do so. However, as I stated before, I can count on one hand how many current archdukes are even capable of obtaining the Grutrissheit, so it would be pointless to create opportunities beyond what is already available to them at this point. For the younger generations with seven-colored schtappes, we will allow them to come to the Academy whenever they have the time to offer prayers at the shrines and seek their Wisdom. They merely need let us know their intent to come so that we might prepare for their arrival.”</p><p>In other words, they would need to send advance warning so the Zent could have proper defenses in place should the archduke candidate have less than noble intentions.</p><p>The aub cleared his throat and said, “Let us discuss selection of the Zent.”</p><p>Once again, everyone perked up. Ferdinand was especially interested in how Aub Dunkelfelger would approach this. He’d only had one day and a sleepless night to even consider zenthood, and he already proposed sweeping yet sensible changes to the very structure of Yurgenschmidt. The man truly was the aub of a top-ranking duchy. On the surface, he seemed a fool whose head was filled with nothing but ditter, yet he had to have incredible intelligence and quick decision-making skills to handle the demands of his duchy, especially with the problems he likely endured while managing half of old Werkestock.</p><p>“We will do it as they did in the beginning.” Aub Dunkelfelger went on to explain the old process. When the Zent was ready to retire, zent candidates would dance the dedication whirl. The magic circle for zent selection would be activated, and the gods would invite the next chosen zent to the Garden of Beginnings. They would then hold the coronation afterwards. The old zent would remain at the Academy to assist with the handover process over the next few years, but once it was complete, they would either retire to their home duchy or live out the remainder of their days in the Academy.</p><p>“As you can see,” he said, “it will be imperative that the zent retire while he or she is still young enough to complete the handover process. I am still in my prime–” Sieglinde raised an eyebrow at this, but he ignored it. “-so I have about twenty years before I should have to retire, though I may well be inclined to do so beforehand. Still, I imagine there will be those loath to give up power until the bitter end, so we’ll put a forced retirement age of fifty, though a Zent could step down before that.”</p><p>He then stated how the selection process would work in detail. The Zent would announce their intent to step down either at the Interduchy Tournament or at the beginning of the Archduke Conference. All zent candidates - those who had completed the archduke candidate course, had obtained the Book of Mestionora, and did not hold a foundation - would dance the dedication whirl on the last day of the conference. Once the new Zent returned from the Garden of Beginnings, they would hold a coronation ceremony where the previous Zent would place the God of Darkness’s cape around the new Zent’s shoulders and the Goddess of Light’s crown on their head. Being High Bishop, these would be created using a schtappe transformation.</p><p>The reigning Zent would need to return to the Garden of Beginnings once every year before the Archduke Conference to update their Grutrissheits.</p><p>When Ferdinand raised a brow at this, the aub shrugged. “Apparently, my Wisdom updating on its own is a special privilege granted by Mestionora given the imminent danger to the country’s foundation. Anyone else who gains their Wisdom will not receive this blessing.”</p><p>Ferdinand had assumed only incomplete books did not update automatically, but it seemed Mestionora was granting him, Rozemyne, and Aub Dunkelfelger a boon in order to save her precious Ewaermen and keep the weave from being unraveled again. He and Rozemyne were of special interest to the goddess for obvious reasons, but it seemed she extended the blessing to Aub Dunkelfelger since he would become Zent and thus fill the depleted foundation. He pondered whether or not he should have Rozemyne remove the mana chain since the petty goddess was making an effort to be useful for a change. Had those foolish gods learned their lesson, though, from their mistake that led to the unraveling of the weave? He couldn’t be sure. These were the same fools who’d nearly killed Rozemyne by overloading her with divine mana. They seemed to understand little of actions and consequences as far as mere mortals were concerned.</p><p>It was interesting, though, that Aub Dunkelfelger would make it a yearly requirement to have one’s Grutrissheit updated.</p><p>“Now, should the unfortunate happen,” he continued, “and the Zent is rejected before receiving any updates to the Grutrissheit, a new Zent will be selected at the end of the conference as per usual. They may have to rely on their Wisdom and more experienced ministers to help with the transition depending on why the previous Zent was rejected.”</p><p>So he was using the updates as an excuse to force the Zent to undergo the golden shumil’s test every year to ensure they had not become unworthy of the role. The man truly was clever.</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger looked to Adolphine and said, “It will be up to the librarians, who have sworn an oath to Mestionora, to determine if a Zent has been rejected. We can discuss the details of how that would be accomplished later.”</p><p>Adolphine looked intrigued as she smirked slightly.</p><p>“Now, onto minor details.” He went on to list several items - that the Zent and those who served them would all wear white capes, the children of the Zent would be considered archduke candidates of the Zent’s home duchy, the Royal Academy librarians would bring over all the books from the palace library during the offseason this year, and Academy professors would continue to wear black capes to signify their neutrality.</p><p>“On that note,” he said, “Dunkelfelger as the Sword of the Zent shall remain neutral.” His gaze flicked to Magdalena. “Regardless of family ties. Ehrenfest accepted the role of Shield of the Zent today when they moved with the Sword and Ahrensbach to defend Yurgenschmidt from the Lanzenavian invasion. They shall also remain neutral.”</p><p>Sylvester nodded, looking somewhat relieved. Even with the rise in rank and recognition the duchy had received, many still held their neutrality during the civil war against them. This would help remove that stigma.</p><p>“Ferdinand, your new duchy will be the repository for printed materials. As the Wisdom of the Zent, you, too, shall remain neutral. Your duchy will also be responsible for ensuring the path to Wisdom is never lost or obfuscated again.”</p><p>He wasn’t expecting to feel as relieved as he did. He’d never enjoyed playing politics, and being forced into neutrality eliminated many of his future headaches. Thinking about those that would remain made him want to sigh and grasp his temples. Good gods, he did not want to be Aub Alexandria. He would rather suffer the infinite migraines the previous Rozemyne would have given him as Aub than hold the position himself. She so effortlessly gained allies and raised the best retainers. He, on the other hand, had to make a spectacle of himself playing harspiel in order to call others to his side.</p><p>Well, thanks to Aub Dunkelfelger’s pronouncement, it seemed allies wouldn’t be as much of a concern for him. He could largely focus those efforts inward.</p><p>“Now then, are there any questions?”</p><p>“I-I have one,” the first queen said, raising her hand. “What will happen if Anastasius doesn’t become Aub?”</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger sighed. “Then I’ll have to appoint someone else.” He held his chin as he hummed for a moment. “As much as it would upset some, I’d have to go with my future son-in-law.”</p><p>Sylvester blanched, and Ferdinand slammed his fist on the table. “Prince Anastasius, I don’t care who it is, but you’d better have a partner by the Archduke Conference!”</p><p>Everyone balked at him, and the aub asked, “What do you have against Wilfried to protest so strongly? He’s come first in class for the knight course twice in a row despite taking two courses, and he’s an excellent tactician and ditter player!”</p><p>“Well, he’s a bit…” Rozemyne said, placing a troubled hand on her cheek.</p><p>Florencia sighed. “He’s very trusting.”</p><p>“Too trusting for an aub,” Sylvester agreed.</p><p>Aub Dunkelfelger laughed. “Fear not! He’d have my Hannelore to support him!”</p><p>“Isn’t she a bit… meek?” Rozemyne asked.</p><p>He barked another laugh as Sieglinde smiled. “She is not nearly so meek as she pretends,” she said. “She is still a true Dunkelfelger woman.”</p><p>“My stance remains the same,” Ferdinand said. “It doesn’t matter who; find someone - <em>anyone</em>!”</p><p>Anastasius could only nod vigorously under the weight of his pointed gaze.</p><p>Chuckling to himself, Aub Dunkelfelger asked once again for questions. When Trauerqual asked about the timeline for all of this, he answered, “The two new duchies must have their aubs by winter, but you will need to dye the foundation before that unless you want your people to starve from a poor harvest. I will redraw the borderlines once I’ve dyed the foundation. I will move to the Academy no later than this summer. You, too, should be prepared to move by then, King Trauerqual. I will be counting on your and your wives’ support while we work to fill the foundation and rebuild the broken shrines. Professor Adolphine, you will be excused from this duty as your mana is needed for the library. I will be counting on you to let me know if and when we need to construct a Central library should the one at the Academy be unable to accommodate the materials you’re acquiring.”</p><p>She bowed to him with a satisfied smile. “I will do as you have ordered.”</p><p>“Right, then,” Aub Dunkelfelger said, “that wraps up the most pertinent topics. More details will be decided in the coming days. Aub Ahrensbach, Lord Gervasio, return to the Academy in one week’s time to sign loyalty contracts. Ferdinand, Rozemyne, we will discuss the contracts for printed materials and yearly ditter at the Archduke Conference.”</p><p>Ferdinand raised a brow. “Are you ordering Rozemyne, an underaged archduke candidate, to attend?”</p><p>He nodded. “How else will we sign the contracts if she isn’t present?”</p><p>Were some threads destined to be woven in certain ways? It was happening a year later than the previous weave, but once again, Rozemyne was being ordered to attend an Archduke Conference despite her age. It was highly unusual, but he couldn’t argue with the Zent. He wondered if they exchanged engagement stones in time whether or not she would be permitted to attend the next one with him as well. Likely not under normal circumstances, but he might make it a part of his ditter spoils this year.</p><p>“It has been a long two days for everyone here,” Aub Dunkelfelger said. “I daresay most of us haven’t visited Schlaftraum in quite some time. Let us depart for our homes. We all have much to do.”</p><p>As they left the Small Hall, Rozemyne approached Aub Ahrensbach, much to Ferdinand’s chagrin. “Pardon, but might I speak with you for just a moment?” she asked.</p><p>He gave her a polite if strained smile. “Certainly, Lady Rozemyne. What can I do for you?”</p><p>“Our duchies will border each other, will they not? I would like to discuss a public works project with you at the Archduke Conference that will benefit both of us.”</p><p>He raised his eyebrows in surprise. “What sort of project?”</p><p>“Building a safe, fast trade route between our duchies. It will allow us to send printed and paper goods to you quicker, and it may even be swift enough that you could send fish to us.”</p><p>Ah, that was her aim. Since Ehrenfest would be bordering the sea to the south as well, this sort of partnership was completely unnecessary, but perhaps she was worried that the long transition period would delay her access to seafood. Ferdinand couldn’t understand her obsession with fish. While the dishes she made with her recipes were appetizing, they didn’t warrant the effort she was about to put into obtaining access to the main ingredient.</p><p>Aub Ahrensbach thought for a moment and nodded. “That may be just the thing we both need to revitalize the regions of Ahrensbach and old Werkestock that have received less mana in recent years.”</p><p>“Yes, about that…” Rozemyne glanced to the left and right before passing him a sound-blocking tool. When Ferdinand cleared his throat, he received one as well, though he could almost see the pout she was hiding behind her polite smile.</p><p>“Aub Ahrensbach,” she said, “the punishment for Lord Gervasio was to supply the foundation by himself until we move in winter.”</p><p>“And to provide feystones thereafter until you have weaned your last child,” he said, his voice flat.</p><p>She nodded. “Yes. However, the quantity and size of the feystones and the frequency at which they are to be sent were not specified, were they?”</p><p>Lucius narrowed his eyes at her for a moment before they widened with recognition. Ferdinand closed his as he fought the urge to pinch the cheeks right off her face. “So you devised a plan to make it look like he was receiving a harsh punishment.”</p><p>“All while keeping his burden light enough that he could help supply Ahrensbach’s foundation and hopefully live a peaceful life.”</p><p>The smile he gave her was highly inappropriate, and it took all of Ferdinand’s self control not to cover his fiancée with his cape. “Control yourself,” he hissed.</p><p>“Ah, right,” Lucius said, trying and failing to wipe the smile off his face. “It is very difficult getting used to hiding one’s emotions.”</p><p>Rozemyne looked at him sympathetically and said, “Your hidden room will be your safe haven.”</p><p>“Yes, I’ve had to use it quite often,” he sighed. “It feels like there's been no end of tragedy since I came here between the previous aub dy–climbing the towering staircase, my fiancée following not long ago, discovering Lady Georgine’s treachery, and the attack from Lanzenave…”</p><p>The man didn’t know how lucky he was that Detlinde had been assassinated. What a travesty of a first or even second wife she would have been! He didn’t understand how someone born from a woman as sharp as Georgine could be so dull.</p><p>“I am sorry for your many losses,” Rozemyne said. “I am certain you will face far less strife in the years ahead.”</p><p>“I thank you ever so much, Lady Rozemyne.” Lucius turned to Ferdinand and said, “I thank you, too, Lord Ferdinand.”</p><p>He scoffed. “There is no reason to thank me.”</p><p>“Did you not come to my duchy’s aid, take down the Lanzenave ships, and give me much-needed advice despite my origins?”</p><p>Yes, all out of self interest. He’d thought he’d be taking over the duchy with Rozemyne at the time.</p><p>“You even helped ensure my father’s punishment was lighter than it appeared.”</p><p>“I did not,” he retorted. “That was entirely Rozemyne’s doing.”</p><p>Lucius laughed. “My, Lord Ferdinand, you do go to such lengths to hide your emotions, don’t you? Well, know that I would be happy to call you cousin, if only in private.”</p><p>“You will do no such thing!” he snapped. “Rozemyne, take back the tool. We’re done here.”</p><p>Still laughing, Lucius handed the sound-blocking tool back to her and said his farewells. Gervasio, standing off to the side, offered his goodbyes as well before they departed for the Ahrensbach dorms with their knights in tow.</p><p>As he and Rozemyne were still holding their tools, only he could hear her when she said, “They’re your family, aren’t they?”</p><p>“No,” he said. “I am an archduke candidate of Ehrenfest, soon to be Aub Alexandria.”</p><p>“But they’re blood-related on your mother’s side.”</p><p>“No, Rozemyne!” He spun on her and spat, “I have no blood relations from my mother because I have no mother. Lest you forget, I was baptized a motherless bastard. Only those who are related to my father are related to me, and you are my true family. Do not bring up this nonsense again.”</p><p>She opened her mouth to reply but wisely shut it. However, she didn’t nod, meaning he had a long conversation in the hidden room to look forward to. His stomach churned at the thought. He thought if anyone could understand that he didn’t want to talk about that distant past, she would after what he’d confessed to her about it.</p><p>“Ferdinand.”</p><p>“What?” he asked, forcing his tone to become neutral despite the emotions swirling inside of him, making him nauseous.</p><p>“Can you promise me something?”</p><p>His eyes narrowed. “It depends on what it is.”</p><p>She looked away for a moment before seeming to gather her courage and turning back to him. “I want you to promise me that after you take my name, you won’t order me not to talk about things.”</p><p>“What…?”</p><p>“I know some things are painful to talk about,” she said, “but that doesn’t mean you should avoid them, either. Talking about them can help you process those dark emotions so that you can heal and move on. I… I won’t force you to talk about anything, but I don’t want you to order me to silence. Please ask me to postpone the discussion instead.”</p><p>He stared at her for several long moments, aghast that she would need to ask such a thing and that he might have given her reason to.</p><p>Gods, would he ever be worthy of her, or would he continue to fall short like this?</p><p>“I promise,” he said at last.</p><p>As she gave him a relieved smile, Sylvester called out to them. “Hey, Ferdinand, Rozemyne, let’s go. I don’t know about you, but that nap this afternoon was nowhere near enough. I may sleep for a week.”</p><p>Ferdinand passed back the sound-blocking tool before turning around to find his brother and sister-in-law approaching. “You hardly did anything, Sylvester. How could you possibly be exhausted?”</p><p>“Hey! I was stressed the whole time. That takes a toll, too, you know!” He shook his head and said, “Why am I even talking to you about this? You live and breathe stress. I think if you ever actually relaxed, you’d go greet the Supreme Couple.”</p><p>“Perhaps you simply lack enough stress. You are rather free spirited for an upper-ranked aub.”</p><p>“Not like I used to be when I was younger. Man, sometimes I miss those days.”</p><p>“I assure you,” Florencia said, “you are the only one.”</p><p>“Well, regardless, I have obligations, and one of those is worrying about my little brother and daughter. We’ll see if I can even reach Schlaftraum’s realm after finding out you’re taking over an abandoned duchy. Pretty sure the giebes Bonifatius fought this morning were from there. Man, you have no idea how glad I am that Rozemyne is going with you, even if it means losing her too soon. She’s going to be instrumental in winning those nobles over to your side.”</p><p>With a sigh, Ferdinand nodded. “I’m well aware.”</p><p>Sylvester heaved a heavy sigh of his own as he looked back at Rozemyne, who was following at a distance as she talked with her brother with sound-blocking tools. She was likely giving him an update on what was discussed. “I wish this all could have waited a couple more years. I’m just… I’m not ready to let her go, you know? Shouldn’t I get a couple more years to be her father?”</p><p>“The adoption isn’t being canceled,” Ferdinand said. Normally, it would have to be in order for her to leave Ehrenfest, but that would demote her back to archnoble status, defeating the purpose of her going to Alexandria before the next term started. Ferdinand couldn’t adopt her to let her regain her status, either, since they were going to be starbound. Since Aub Dunkelfelger would be making a new duchy, he had reasoned he could appoint the archduke and therefore any archduke candidates. It probably crossed the line, but since zents wouldn’t likely create new duchies too often, it didn’t seem too dangerous of a precedent to set.</p><p>“It’s not the same,” Sylvester insisted. “She’ll be far away. I won’t get to see her except at the Archduke Conference and maybe if we have time to arrange visits to each other every so often. Melchior’s going to take this hard. He’s practically a little Hartmut with how much he looks up to her as his big sister.”</p><p>“He’s not the only one who will be struggling with it,” Florencia sighed, holding a hand to her cheek. “I will miss our tea parties. She’s such a delight, so long as you can avoid talking about books.”</p><p>Ferdinand was genuinely surprised at that. He knew Rozemyne would sometimes have tea with Florencia, Charlotte, and Elvira, but he hadn’t realized they’d developed that much of a bond. He’d always dismissed her in his mind as secondary to Elvira, but it seemed she was truly acting as her adoptive mother.</p><p>He began to doubt whether bringing Rozemyne along before their starbind was in her best interest. She would be losing the support network that had been carefully built this weave. While her true family would be in Alexandria, she would likely only see them once a season. Wasn’t it a terrible idea to take a young girl from her mothers so soon?</p><p>If only the Linkbergs would come along as Rozemyne’s retainers. Karstedt would have to resign as Sylvester’s head guard knight, though, which would never happen, and since Wilfried was still underaged, Lamprecht would likely be the knight commander in his father’s stead. The man simply didn’t have the qualities necessary to succeed at the role, but there wasn’t really anyone who ranked above him. Perhaps Bonifatius would come out of retirement until Wilfried graduated.</p><p>Ferdinand shook his head. There was no point in thinking about impossibilities. He had far more important items to devote his faculties to.</p><p>Like avoiding being alone with Rozemyne until he could protect himself with the Shield of Schutzaria.</p>

<p>The moment they returned to Ehrenfest, Ferdinand went to his estate and collapsed in bed, not even letting Janrik change his clothes. When he woke the next day, however, he found himself in his sleep shirt and pants, so it seemed at least one of his attendants changed him regardless. After breakfast, he received a summons to return to the castle that afternoon where Sylvester announced to the rest of the archducal family and Linkbergs the decisions made by the soon-to-be Zent Werdekraf.</p><p>Bonifatius, Elvira, and Karstedt were devastated to be losing Rozemyne. “How dare you take my granddaughter from me!” the former knight commander yelled. “She’s too young to follow a marriage partner outside of the duchy! Shouldn’t she be here at least until she comes of age?!”</p><p>“Father,” Karstedt said, “while I agree with you, this is the Zent’s decision.”</p><p>“So you’re leaving this winter?” Lamprecht asked. He grimaced at Rozemyne’s nod and said, “My son won’t even know your face.”</p><p>“There’s still so much for Florenica and I to teach you,” Elvira lamented. “We will, of course, make the most of the time we have left, but…” She sighed and stroked Rozemyne’s hair. “It will be difficult letting my daughter go.”</p><p>Rozemyne lowered her head and nodded, her hands clenching with unspent emotion.</p><p>“Still, to think you’ll be First Wife of a duchy,” Cornelius said. “I never thought you’d be leaving Ehrenfest… I guess Lamprecht will be the heir to Linkberg now.”</p><p>“Huh? Me?”</p><p>“Of course,” Eckhart said. “Naturally, I must follow Lord Ferdinand since he holds my name, and Cornelius will follow his lady. That means you and your son will inherit our house. In fact, once I move out, you can have my estate until that time comes. Someone will need to maintain it, after all, and you can’t stay in a side building forever.”</p><p>That seemed to be the moment the reality of the situation hit Lamprecht. His eyes widened, and his jaw dropped slightly as he stared at the members of his family before his eyes landed on Rozemyne. “I…”</p><p>“It’s okay, Brother Lamprecht,” she said, giving him a sad smile. “We can talk more at the training grounds. We always communicate better with practice swords than with words, right?”</p><p>He gave an uncertain nod.</p><p>“I shall meet you there as well!” Bonifatius yelled. “Of course, I must put in extra time with your scholars before they leave to ensure they are capable of serving you well!”</p><p>“Poor souls,” Eckhart laughed.</p><p>“Sister…”</p><p>Rozemyne turned to Charlotte, who looked ready to cry. “I was counting on your support when I became Aub Ehrenfest.”</p><p>“I know,” Rozemyne said, “but this just means you’ll have another greater duchy as an ally. You’ll only grow stronger from now on, and I look forward to seeing how much my little sister will make Ehrenfest prosper.”</p><p>Melchior looked between his two sisters for a moment before he clenched his fist and said, “Sister, I don’t want you to go…”</p><p>“I know,” she said, giving him another sad smile, “but I won’t be leaving until winter, and we’ll be in the Academy together your first year. Since I’ll be the aub’s wife, I’ll be able to see you at the Interduchy Tournaments after that, too.”</p><p>“I… I know,” he said, looking down.</p><p>“Uncle…”</p><p>Silence fell over the room as everyone turned to Wilfried.</p><p>“What is it?” Ferdinand asked.</p><p>Tensing, Wilfried gulped and said, “I… I still have a lot left to learn from you.”</p><p>He scoffed and replied, “You’re shaping up to be a fine knight, Wilfried. While there is always more to learn, I feel comfortable knowing I can leave the protection of Ehrenfest in your capable hands. Still, I will teach you what I am able before I leave this winter.”</p><p>Wilfried nodded. “Alright. You’d better protect my little sister, too. I’m counting on you.”</p><p>“Who do you think I am?” Ferdinand asked.</p><p>“No, the question is who do you think <em>I</em> am?” Rozemyne snapped. “I can protect myself, you know!”</p><p>“Indeed, she can!” Bonifatius bellowed.</p><p>“Yeah, says the girl who was kidnapped two days ago.”</p><p>“Hey, if it came down to it, I could have gotten out,” Rozemyne said.</p><p>“Oh? And how would you have pulled that off with a sealed schtappe?”</p><p>She puffed out her chest and said, “He already had one foot on the towering staircase. It would’ve only taken one more hit to push him up the stairs, and then I could have gotten the feystone from him and let myself out.”</p><p>Wilfried rolled his eyes, but Sylvester intervened before the argument could continue. “There’s no point fighting over what-if’s,” he said. “We need to focus on what to do next. Rozemyne, I’m sure you’ll want to talk to your retainers to figure out which ones will be going with you. Ordinarily, scholars stay in their home duchies, but we’ll make an exception in this case. You and Ferdinand know far more than all of your scholars put together about the inner workings of Ehrenfest, so it’s not like they pose a security risk. Just make sure news doesn’t go beyond your retainers and your downtown associates. I don’t need Leisegang breathing down my neck until I’m ready to announce your departure.”</p><p>With that, Sylvester cleared the room of everyone but the archducal family. Once the Linkbergs had left, he reminded everyone of the location of the true path to the foundation and said, “Rozemyne’s going to have to pass off the role of High Bishop, so–”</p><p>“Father,” Charlotte interrupted him, “I should be the one to take it.”</p><p>“Huh? Not Melchior?”</p><p>“Yeah!” the boy chimed. “I’m supposed to be High Bishop!”</p><p>Charlotte nodded. “And so you shall be, but not yet. As future archduchess, I should be the one to protect the foundation until I come of age. Once I do, I’ll pass the key to Melchior.”</p><p>“Sounds reasonable,” Sylvester agreed. “Very well. Rozemyne, you’ll be handing your High Bishop duties over to Charlotte. Elvira is already part of the printing industry, so you can focus on handing the rest of the local business over to her. We’ll need to find a replacement for High Priest who will be doing most of the actual work in the temple sooner rather than later.”</p><p>“Wait, that should be Marcellus, right?” Melchior asked. “We already planned for my scholar to become High Priest when I became High Bishop, so shouldn’t he be the one replacing Hartmut?”</p><p>Rozemyne nodded. “I believe Hartmut has already been training him in anticipation of your taking the role from me,” she said. “We’ll merely need to move up the timeline”</p><p>With a clap of his hands, Wilfried said, “Well, there you go. Problem solved. What’re we going to do about Knight Commander and the Strike Squad?”</p><p>“Is it not obvious?” Ferdinand asked. “Karstedt will resume his duties as Knight Commander, and you can take Cornelius’s spot as head of the Strike Squad.”</p><p>“What? Me?!” he balked.</p><p>“You led them during the Lanzenavian evasion, no? What better method to prove your suitability for the role than filling it during actual battle?”</p><p>“What about the Lord of Winter hunt? I won’t be there for the next two.”</p><p>Ferdinand shrugged. “They’ll manage with the vice captain, and she can take your place once you become Knight Commander. It’s not as though you’ll inherit the role the moment you come of age. You’ll need at least a couple Lord of Winter hunts under your belt before you can fully take command.”</p><p>Furrowing his brows, Wilfried asked, “Didn’t you become Knight Commander when you graduated from the Academy?”</p><p>Sylvester waved his hand and said, “He’s an exception, and I agree that you should wait a couple of years after you graduate. Now then, if there’s no other business–”</p><p>“Actually, Sylvester,” Rozemyne said, “I need to talk to you about taking guardianship of Emilia, Ludolf, and Rainer. They were just baptized as your wards this winter, and I’m taking them on to be my retainers.”</p><p>He leaned back in his chair as he thought for a moment. “Ah, right, those three. Yeah, sure, we can draw up the contracts later. You know this means I won’t be giving them financial support anymore, right?”</p><p>“Yes, I’m well aware. Don’t worry.”</p><p>“As long as you know. Well, then, let’s go ahead and wrap things up. Winter socializing is still going on, and I’ve got to go make some appearances to help calm everyone down after the attack yesterday morning. Granted, most of the giebes from the border already left once word of the invasion came, but their absence is only making things more chaotic. Ferdinand, Rozemyne, I don’t want you anywhere near the socializing scene for the next two days. I’m officially ordering you to rest.”</p><p>That was fine by Ferdinand. He needed some time to organize his thoughts, anyway. Three lifetimes had passed in the past two days, and he’d been burying a lot of thoughts and feelings that were going to explode if he didn’t take some time to unpack them.</p><p>Rozemyne obviously realized that was the case because as they were leaving, she announced that she was going to go to the temple so she could go to her hidden room where no one would disturb her for a while. Ferdinand took the queue and headed to his estate. He turned down tea and told his retainers to go rest while he went to his hidden room. They didn’t have to be told twice after everything they endured the past two days. Of course, Justus’s idea of resting was to go to the Grand Hall to hunt for new information. Janrik decided to go home for a couple of bells to be with his wife and newborn, and Eckhart and Lasfam stated they would be on standby in the mansion.</p><p>When Ferdinand entered his hidden room, he looked around at the piles of papers, books, boards, and materials, wondering why he hadn’t started organizing and packing already. He’d been planning on taking over Ahrensbach, so he should have gotten to work on this already. At least everything from the temple was still packed away in boxes for the most part, so that was part of the work done.</p><p>It wasn’t long before Rozemyne appeared, wearing a weary expression now that she no longer had her noble mask in place. However, despite his expectations, she didn’t say a word. Instead, she took a seat on his bench and looked around the room as though cataloging his belongings. At first, Ferdinand allowed her to sit in contemplation as he began organizing his ingredients and notes to make packing them away easier.</p><p>Images of the last time he’d prepared to say goodbye to this hidden room flooded him along with the echoes of the heart wrenching pain that had wracked his body. He’d planned to give everything to Rozemyne, certain that he would ascend to the distant heights long before she finished turning his mansion into a proper library. Knowing he might not ever see her again so soon after she claimed him as family had nearly killed him.</p><p>He cleared his head of the dark memories and instead decided it would be more productive to break the silence. “Ask whatever it is that’s on your mind,” he said.</p><p>Rozemyne fidgeted for a moment before she finally took a deep breath and asked, “Was Lord Gervasio also from Adalgisa?”</p><p>Sighing heavily, Ferdinand sat down and pinched the bridge of his nose. While he was expecting the topic to come up, that didn’t make it any easier to talk about. He decided the best way to deal with this was to get it over with as quickly as possible. “Yes,” he said, “he was the one chosen to become king, meaning all the other boys were fated to become feystones. He was born around twenty years before I was.”</p><p>She nodded slowly. “So he was related to the woman who gave birth to you?”</p><p>For some reason, it both gladdened and saddened him that she didn’t refer to her as his mother. “Yes, he was likely her brother.”</p><p>“Can you tell me why you don’t want to accept him?”</p><p>He shook his head as he closed his eyes. “There are many reasons. For one, he tried to take over Yurgenschmidt in the previous weave.”</p><p>“What about this weave?” she asked.</p><p>She didn’t say it in an accusatory way. Instead, she seemed to understand it wasn’t <em>just</em> the previous weave Ferdinand held against him.</p><p>Shaking his head again, he ran a hand through his hair and sighed, trying to exhale the pain in his chest. “Whenever I see his face, I remember that place. I remember the sickly sweet smell, the woman who looked at me as Glucklitat’s trial, the other boys who had numbers for names who vanished one after the other, the fear of knowing I’d be following soon because I wasn’t good enough. There was no family there. There was only the command to endure. The women had to endure unwanted visits from men as they lost the children they bore. The girls had to endure until they were taken in by the collateral royal family. The boys had to endure until they were taken away to never be seen again.</p><p>“I had no mother and no siblings. I had a broken woman who’d lost too much and rivals competing with me for the right to live, though it was a competition we’d long since lost because Gervasio had been chosen twenty years before I was born.</p><p>“That is why I won’t accept him as family. Every time I look at him, all I can see is that horrible palace where I was a number.”</p><p>Rozemyne sat in silence for a long while, letting his heated blood cool as he took steadying breaths. Eventually, she said, “I understand.”</p><p>Ferdinand blinked at her. “What?”</p><p>“Well, I don’t fully understand because I haven’t experienced anything similar,” she said, “but if someone told me to play nice with Detlinde because she was my cousin, I would have reacted about the same way. I just… I’m sorry. I was thinking about this like I would Letizia. She didn’t do anything in this weave, and she was tricked into poisoning you last weave, making her innocent. I would absolutely accept her as family. I thought that since you and Lord Gervasio both experienced what it was like in the palace and you both agreed it was a terrible place that should have been shut down, then you’d view him more like a Letizia and less like a Detlinde.”</p><p>Despite Rozemyne seeing Letizia poison him on a regular basis, she still saw her in a favorable light. This was why people called her a saint. With a sigh, Ferdinand leaned back in his chair and stared at the ceiling. It was true that Gervasio hated the palace likely as much as he did, and it was true that he hadn’t done anything against him in this weave. The only true difference was that the Lanzenavians were given a safe haven. Because of that, Raublut’s early manipulations didn’t work.</p><p>Still, it was Lanzenave who perpetuated the practice of sending flowers, and it was Lanzenave who lived off the sacrifices of children. And what had Gervasio done to stop it before Raublut dangled the Book of Mestionora before him, even knowing his sister was suffering from it? Absolutely nothing. Instead, he eventually decided to run away, and he was going to let his political rivals murder and kidnap their way through Ahrensbach without offering so much as a word of protest. He was a selfish, brutal man who only cared about his own agenda. All it took was one denial from Ferdinand before he was ready to turn him into a feystone. He only acted politely now because he already had what he wanted. Why would he want to be related to a man like that?</p><p>He had to admit, however, that he had some respect for Lucius. He at least lived up to the ideals his father professed to follow. He fought against his own people to protect those born in Yurgenschmidt and transplanted from Lanzenave alike. At no point did he demonstrate the hypocritical righteousness of Gervasio. If it weren’t for his naivety and inability to mesh with Yurgenschmidt culture, he would have been a fine aub. With a few more years experience, he might be able to overcome those weaknesses. Ferdinand wouldn’t mind claiming some sort of relationship with the man, but that would mean accepting Gervasio, which he couldn’t do.</p><p>He knew that some people processed negative emotions associated with terrible events by connecting with others who also experienced them. However, Ferdinand felt no need to process his time in Adalgisa. He only wanted to forget.</p><p>“Perhaps Lucius might be a Letizia one day,” he finally admitted, “but not if it means accepting Gervasio as a Detlinde.”</p><p>“I don’t see how that would be a problem,” Rozemyne said. “We’ll see Aub Ahrensbach at Archduke Conferences, but we’d only run into Lord Gervasio at Interduchy Tournaments, and it wouldn’t be impossible to avoid him or keep our exchanges brief. It wouldn’t be that different from talking to Letizia while ignoring Detlinde.”</p><p>Ferdinand sighed. “Perhaps. I’m done discussing this.”</p><p>“Ah, then does that mean we can move on to this?” Rozemyne held out a white box, causing Ferdinand to freeze.</p><p>“You’re certain about this, then?” he asked.</p><p>“Of course,” she said. “I already told you that I think it’s the most effective way to help me figure out which timeline I’m in. I’m tired of waking up screaming and having to ask my attendants questions I should already know the answers to.”</p><p>“You know what it truly means to give your name? That it’s not just a remedy for an ailment?”</p><p>She nodded. “I know. My main motivation may be to help with the nightmares and confusion upon waking, but…” Rozemyne looked away and squirmed, her cheeks coloring. “I understand it can be quite the romantic gesture as well.”</p><p>Ferdinand nodded as he went to a cabinet and rifled through one of the drawers. “That it can.” Pulling out the white box he’d kept locked inside, he walked over to Rozemyne and knelt before her, holding out his namestone to her. Her eyes widened upon seeing it, and he couldn’t help but smirk. “Rozemyne, I know you value equality in relationships, that you despise the master-servant dynamic that name swearing can lead to. Therefore, before you swear your name to me, please take mine.”</p><p>“Ferdinand,” she gasped, “are…are you sure?”</p><p>He nodded. “Rozemyne, I’ve lived through two weaves for you. You will one day be my all-goddess. I swear my name to you that I may always be with you, no matter how far apart we might be, that my life may be bound to yours, that my future would forever be intertwined with yours. Will you accept my name?”</p><p>She covered her mouth as tears welled in her eyes, and she gave a silent nod. After taking the white box in her small hands, she held it to her breast and poured her mana into it. Ferdinand didn’t know what to expect from the experience. The first time she’d taken his name, he’d only been half conscious, so he hadn’t registered much outside of the order to live. The second time, she’d been full of divine mana, which caused him a significant amount of pain. This time, however, he only experienced a mild discomfort. Was it because she was dyed in his colors, and their mana capacities were well-matched?</p><p>Wiping her eyes, Rozemyne held out her white box and said, “Ferdinand, I swear my name to you, my God of Darkness, in the hopes that we will live a long, happy life together before we ascend the towering staircase side by side. By swearing my name, I pray that the gods will bind our threads forever and let us be reborn together and find each other again in the next life.”</p><p>Despite what he knew of Rozemyne’s past, Ferdinand hadn’t given much thought to a “next life.” Upon ascending the towering staircase, one would spend the rest of eternity with the gods unless they were barred from the greatest heights. Had she just told him she would eschew eternity in Mestionora’s library in the hopes of reincarnating with him? He knew she placed her family above books, but this was something else entirely. How she could care so deeply for someone such as him was unfathomable. Why would he be allowed to be with such a wonderful woman? She might have been a gremlin, but could anyone care for someone as deeply as she did?</p><p>He took the box from her and held it between his hands. “Brace yourself,” he said. When she nodded, he quickly dyed it, noticing she gave a slight wince.</p><p>“Oh, that wasn’t nearly as bad as I was expecting,” she said once she saw her stone had been completely dyed. She looked up for a moment and then sighed with relief. “I can feel your mana around me. I was worried since I was dyed in your colors that I wouldn’t be able to really tell, but I’m glad that wasn’t the case. Now then, I want a hug!”</p><p>Chuckling, Ferdinand stood and pulled her into his arms. With her warm cheek pressed to his chest and her sweet rinsham surrounding him, a peace he was wholly unfamiliar with settled over him. What he wouldn’t give to never have to let go.</p><p>When she looked up at him, her face adorably flush and her eyes burning with Brenwarmme’s fire, the peace vanished, leaving him equal parts hot and cold. He closed his eyes against the enticing image and reminded himself that she wasn’t as old as she looked. After several deep breaths, he stepped back, letting his arms fall away from her. “Have you scheduled a meeting with the Gutenbergs yet?” he asked, desperately reaching for an innocuous topic to discuss.</p><p>Rozemyne sighed but nodded. “Yes, I’ll see them in three days. We’ll have to see who’s coming to Alexandria. I’m not going to ask them to move over winter, of course. I’m thinking probably after Spring Prayer, but we’ll see what Benno says. I’m going to talk with my temple attendants tomorrow to see who wants to come. We can either transfer them over to the temple there and have me be High Bishop again, or I can purchase them outright like I did Rosina.”</p><p>“Would purchasing them not be easier?” Ferdinand asked.</p><p>“Maybe,” she shrugged, “but I want them to make that decision. Maybe they want to remain as gray robes rather than commoner servants. Sylvester may not let me take Finn, though, since he’s more or less in charge of the Rozemyne Workshop. Maybe he can train a successor, though, if he would prefer to come. Regardless, I plan to establish another workshop in the orphanage in Alexandria like I did in Dunkelfelger. I also need to meet with Sylvester to make a new contract so that the books sent here per the legal deposit agreement can be forwarded to us. I think that would be easier than redoing contracts with four - well, I guess three duchies, especially since Klassenberg is going to be looking for ways to lash out.”</p><p>Ferdinand nodded. “It would be most advantageous if Klassenberg dropped below Ehrenfest in the rankings this year. That would make the few nobles joining this duchy more amenable to the change.”</p><p>“True, they’ll definitely see it as trading up if the alternative is being below the seventh, or whatever place Ehrenfest will take this year. Sylvester could send craftspeople from the northern provinces to construct the stages for summoning spring this summer, too, to try to win them over more. Oh, I’ll have to look more closely at the ritual for cooling the summer heat before we move to Alexandria. I bet it gets super warm in parts of old Werkestock. OH!” Rozemyne suddenly clapped her hands. “The feyplant I promised to tell you about! I don’t know if they have them down there or not, so let’s plan to go to the forest outside the lower city on the next sunny day. We don’t have long if you want to see them.”</p><p>Ferdinand’s heart nearly skipped a beat in his excitement. “I see. We can fly out–”</p><p>“No!” she said. “Commoners depend on these plants to live through the winter, and they’re one of the few things to look forward to all season. They use them for food and animal fodder. If we show up in highbeasts with our retinues in tow, not only might it catch the eye of a nosy noble who might start trying to harvest all the fruits for themselves, but it’ll scare off the commoners who are getting food for their families and livestock. No, you should talk to Justus about a disguise. We can sneak into the forest like Sylvester does when he goes hunting. I’ll send a letter to the Gilberta company. Let’s see… We only have until fourth bell to see the plants, so we’ll want to leave right at daybreak.”</p><p>He nodded. “It will be sunny tomorrow.”</p><p>She shook her head. “Neither of us will have proper clothes in time. Let’s plan on the day after tomorrow. I’m sure Justus and Tuuli can find something for us in the secondhand shops by then.”</p><p>“Secondhand…?”</p><p>“Oh, don’t worry. You can just waschen the clothes. They’re typically clean, anyway. The clothes I wore downtown when I was an apprentice shrine maiden were from a secondhand shop that Benno took me to. They won’t be like the fancy robes you’re used to, of course, but maybe it’s not too dissimilar to what’s worn under feystone armor? It’ll be a tunic, pants, and–”</p><p>“I’m aware of what commoners wear,” Ferdinand sighed. “We’ll need to cut this visit short if we’re to have time to prepare.”</p><p>“Right! Okay, then I’ll see you later, Ferdinand!” she said, her dazzling smile warming the room. He felt an answering one tug at his lips, causing her to giggle with delight before she vanished.</p><p>Gods, she could make him act so shamelessly.</p><p>Fixing his expression, he stepped out of the hidden room and sent an ordonnanz to Justus. When he explained to his attendant what he needed, the man’s eyes lit with an unnerving excitement.</p><p>What had he just gotten himself into?</p>

<p>“High Bishop, you can open your eyes now.”</p><p>At Nicola’s prompting, I looked into the mirror and grinned. My hair, tied up in a simple bun like my real mother often wore, was a grayish-blue thanks to the powder Justus had provided me. It would rub off on my clothes if I left my hair down, so I had no choice but to disguise myself as an adult woman. I was close enough physically to coming of age that I looked the part.</p><p>The changed hair, combined with the light contouring cosmetics, made me appear different enough that I doubted anyone would really recognize me at first glance. They wouldn’t be expecting to see the archduke’s daughter in commoner clothes. Tuuli had done an amazing job selecting an outfit for my forest date today. It consisted of a plain white tie-up blouse, dark blue vest, purple skirt, and a coat in the same shade as the vest. The wooden clogs would take a little getting used to again, but I stealthily put on some feystone shoes that I shaped like low-cut socks to minimize any uncomfortable rubbing.</p><p>“Thank you, Nicola,” I said, getting to my feet. “Now, remember, you’re not to breathe a word of this to anyone.”</p><p>She nodded emphatically, and I headed for the door.</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne,” Fran said, holding out a nervous hand as though he was debating whether or not to stop me, “do be careful.”</p><p>“Of course,” I said. “Fear not. I shall be well guarded. Now, would you check to make sure the hallway is clear.”</p><p>“...Yes, Lady Rozemyne.” With a reluctant sigh, Fran opened the door and peered into the hall. “It is indeed empty.”</p><p>“Wonderful. Now, remember, you’re to tell anyone who asks after me that I’m in my hidden room.” At his nod, I slipped into the hall, closed the door, and activated the amulet of Verbergen I had hidden under my shirt. Then, I slipped off my wooden clogs and tiptoed down the hall in my feystone socks, wary of making any loud noises that the amulet might not muffle. Eventually, I made it to the lower city exit. All I had to do from there was go to a particular alleyway, draw half a heart on the ground, and wait.</p><p>Not too long after, an invisible hand traced the other half of the heart. With a rather unnoble smile, I deactivated my amulet. Ferdinand was a beat behind, and the moment I saw him, I froze.</p><p>I’d seen him in armor, blue priest robes, and noble robes. None of them prepared me for the vision that was Ferdinand in form-fitting commoner’s clothes. His tunic draped deliciously over his strong chest and tucked into pants that outlined his toned thighs. His leather knee-high boots hugged his shapely calves. The brown coat he wore was open, suggesting he had skin-tight feystone armor underneath his clothing.</p><p>Feelings I had been fighting since sometime after my mana sensing developed flooded me, and I felt my face go hot as my treacherous eyes trailed down to where his pants hugged a very particular part. Naturally, they were nowhere near tight enough to give me a hint of anything, but my hormone-addled brain didn’t care.</p><p><em>NICE, JUSTUS!</em> I mentally cheered. I was going to give that man whatever he wanted as a reward.</p><p>This must have been what it was like for men trying to catch a glimpse of ankle once upon a time.</p><p>With deliberate effort, I dragged my eyes back to his face and gasped. Justus had somehow colored Ferdinand’s hair a dark blue similar to my natural color, and it was pulled back into a ponytail. I immediately thought that this was probably what our son would look like, my face heating up even more at the implication.</p><p>Thankfully, I didn’t have to worry about my cheeks being pinched for my unladylike expressions because Ferdinand was having the most massive processing error I’d ever seen. Staring at his face as I waited for it to pass just kept making me think of our future kids and all that would entail, looking down put me face-to-face with his amazing chest, and even further down…</p><p>I settled on thinking about our kids.</p><p>Eventually, he blinked a few times and said, “Your hair.”</p><p>I almost reached up to touch it but caught myself. “Yeah, I didn’t have a choice. The powder would get all over everything otherwise.”</p><p>He gave an absent-minded nod.</p><p>“Anyway,” I said, dragging my mind out of the gutter, “we can’t call each other by our actual names. Let’s see… You can call me Rose. And you can be… Dino!”</p><p>Sighing, he tapped his temple and said, “Aren’t those a bit too close to our actual names? Should we not pick something entirely unrelated?”</p><p>“It’ll be fine if you can fix the way you talk,” I protested. “You’re too noble. Be a little cruder.”</p><p>“Cruder…?”</p><p>“Yeah, like instead of saying, ‘Should we not pick something entirely unrelated?’ say ‘We gotta use completely different names.’”</p><p>He frowned as though tasting something disgusting as he muttered, “‘Gotta…’”</p><p>A snort of laughter escaped me, and I covered my nose and mouth in an effort to silence any more. The tips of his ears turned the most adorable shade of pink as he heaved a sigh and said, “This is utterly ridiculous.”</p><p>“‘This is dumb.’”</p><p>“It’s exceedingly ‘dumb.’ And do something about that shameless expression.”</p><p>I waggled a finger at him, not bothering to fight the wide grin on my face. “Nope! You have to be more open with your emotions as a commoner. You’ll make people uncomfortable otherwise.”</p><p>The slight twitch around his eyes said, <em>So be it. I’m uncomfortable enough as it is. Perhaps my mask will convince others to keep to themselves,</em></p><p>“Oh, Dino,” I sighed, “did you not listen to a word dear old Stu said about how to act like a commoner? With a memory as perfect as yours, I’m surprised you’re struggling so much. Well, we can’t keep wasting time here. The parue trees will disappear at fourth bell.” I reached out and took his hand to lead him towards the city gate, but he nearly yanked me back into him as he tried to pull free.</p><p>“Roze– Rose!” he hissed. “How could you so brazenly–”</p><p>“Oh, don’t be silly,” I said. “You escort me all the time. How is this any different?”</p><p>“It’s completely different!”</p><p>“Dino, this is how commoner couples walk together,” I insisted, delighting in his adorable blush. “Or will you have me walk through the town without a proper escort?”</p><p>He closed his eyes and ground his teeth, and I waited patiently for him to admit defeat. Finally, he reluctantly took my outstretched hand, and I led him towards the South Gate. As we neared, I felt tears sting my eyes.</p><p>
<em>Dad! Ah, and little Kamil!</em>
</p><p>There waiting just before the gate were my dad, little brother, and Lutz, all of them carrying empty bags on their belts and firewood on their backs. We needed someone to help pick the parues since I wasn’t sure what would happen if someone with mana touched the tree. They said you had to use the heat of your hands to get the parues to fall, but for all I knew, the tree branches were actually reacting to the minute traces of mana in commoners.</p><p>Ferdinand stiffened as we approached, and he tried to pull his hand back, but I held on fast. We’d been engaged for four years, and my downtown associates all knew it. There was no reason to be embarrassed by a little hand holding.</p><p>When Dad caught sight of me, his nose turned red as he valiantly fought back his tears. It made me a little misty eyed as well. However, years of training under my two mothers taught me how to hold back.</p><p>“Hi!” I said, giving a little wave. “I’m Rose, and this is Dino. Thanks for taking us out today!”</p><p>Lutz smiled at me as he said, “‘S no problem. Anything for a friend of Master Benno. Oh, I almost forgot. I’m Lutz, this is Gunther, and this guy here is his son, Kamil.”</p><p>“Good to meet you, Rose! And you, too, Dino,” Dad said. “Say hello, Kamil.”</p><p>“Hi! I’m Kamil.”</p><p>I couldn’t help but grin as I squeezed Ferdinand’s hand to keep myself from wrapping my little brother in a tight squeeze. “How old are you, Kamil?”</p><p>“Seven!”</p><p>“Oh, so you already have apprentice work?”</p><p>He nodded. “I’m a lehange at the Plantin Company! We make paper and books.”</p><p>“And do you like books?”</p><p>“Yeah, I love them!”</p><p>
<em>Ah! He’s too precious! If I could just pat his head, I’m sure my soul would be healed forever. Cuteness really is justice!</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand gave me a light tug, and I realized I'd been bouncing on the balls of my feet with my desire to hug the stuffing out of this little cutie. “That’s wonderful,” I said. “What kind of—“</p><p>“Rose, aren’t we on a deadline?” Ferdinand said, cutting me off and making me turn to pout at him a little. The way his fingers twitched let me know he was itching to pinch my cheeks.</p><p>Kamil tilted his head at Ferdinand in the most adorable way. “You talk kind of funny.”</p><p>Before I could step in, Lutz swooped in to save the day. “Well yeah. He’s a merchant friend of Master’s, and he deals with nobility all the time. Remember, you gotta talk like a noble if you wanna do business with them. Anyway, Dino’s right. We need to get a move on if we want to get our hands on any parues.”</p><p>I could practically feel Ferdinand buzzing with excitement as we passed through the gate and headed for a patch of fey trees that hadn’t been claimed yet. Since it was the end of the season, there were few growing in the area. “Alright,” Dad said, slipping the basket off his back. “The first thing we have to do is make a fire.” He waved Ferdinand over as he began setting up the wood and kindling he brought. “Let me show you how it’s done.”</p><p>Kamil stared at the two of them for a moment before he asked Lutz, “Oh, so is he like Avery?”</p><p>“Avery?” I asked.</p><p>He nodded. “He’s the grandson of the merchant guild master. He’s studied noble etiquette, and he’s also pretty useless with—!”</p><p>As Lutz frantically slapped a hand over his mouth, Ferdinand threw an annoyed look at him, and I burst into laughter. “Well,” I said as I got myself under control, “Dino may not know how to start a fire like this, but I promise he’s far from useless. He’s an excellent hunter, for instance, and he’s really strong.”</p><p>“Eh?!” Kamil asked. He ran over, interrupting him as Dad was showing him how to light the kindling with flint. I wasn’t sure if Ferdinand actually knew how to do it already or not, but he was enjoying himself so much that it didn’t matter either way.</p><p>His eyes lit with excitement, Kamil said, “Mr. Dino! Mr. Dino! What all have you hunted?”</p><p>“Ah, a moment.” The sparks were just catching, so he leaned down as Dad instructed and blew on them until they made a small fire. Dad started slowly feeding it while Ferdinand answered, “I’ve hunted many feybeasts, great and small.”</p><p>“Really?! Like what? What was the biggest?”</p><p>That brought him up short since the answer was probably the Lord of Winter. I imagined he also correctly guessed a goltze was too big for a commoner to take down. He tapped at his temple for a moment as he considered his answer before saying, “I cannot say it was the largest, but I’ve hunted a fetze before.”</p><p>“What’s a fetze?” Kamil asked.</p><p>Laughing nervously, Lutz said, “You know zantzes? The bigger version of them is a fetze.”</p><p>“How big was it?”</p><p>Ferdinand glanced around until he found a branch that was about half again as high up as he was tall. “The same height as that branch.”</p><p>“WHAT?! No way!!” Kamil cried. “You can’t be serious! Wouldn’t that need a knight to take down?”</p><p>“If you know where to fire your arrow, you can shoot it in the feystone and fell it with one shot.”</p><p>“Eh, isn’t that kind of a waste?”</p><p>Ferdinand looked at him the same way he used to look at me when I was an apprentice shrine maiden and said something “out of standard.” I jumped in to save him from his processing error. “Dino likes to hunt for sport sometimes, and the only way for a commoner to take down a feybeast of that size is to go for the feystone. He’s really good at getting nearly everything he can from smaller feybeasts, though.” Nothing I said was technically a lie.</p><p>“Oh, I get it,” Kamil said. “You just wanted to see if you could do it. What did you do with a feystone that big, though? I don’t think the shop would buy something like that.”</p><p>“He works directly with nobles, remember?” I answered. “One of them was interested in it.”</p><p>“Alright, enough about all that,” Dad said. “Kamil, up the tree you go!” He gave my little brother a boost, and Kamil scrambled up the trunk until he came to the first branch with a fruit. “He’s gonna hold onto the branch until it gets warm enough. When it does, the parue will fall, and you’ll need to be ready to catch it.”</p><p>Ferdinand nodded and stood below Kamil, easily catching the fruit as it fell.</p><p>“Nice catch!” Kamil said as he slid down the tree and ran over to the fire to warm his darling little hands.</p><p>Ferdinand glanced at him and nodded before turning his attention back to the fruit. “Fascinating,” he murmured. I could tell he was pushing a little mana into it, and it made me wonder if it would affect the taste. Would it be even sweeter with his mana in it? If so, it’d probably taste worse to everyone else.</p><p>Lutz went up the tree next, sending down a second fruit faster than Kamil had. The two of them rotated out since Dad was getting kind of old to be climbing trees. It was a shame Tuuli and Mom were working. It would have been fun to have them along as well.</p><p>Well, I would get my chance to see them again soon. I just needed to hold out until then.</p><p>“So Rose,” Dad said as the boys gathered parues, “how have you been?”</p><p>“I’ve been well, Gunther,” I replied. It occurred to me that I’d been calling him by his name nearly as long as I had called him Dad. For some reason, the realization made me sad. “I got, uh, recognized for being the best, um, apprentice in my…workshop for the past four years.”</p><p>“Of course you did!” Dad laughed, and my chest welled with joy at the praise. He didn’t say anything else, though, since we were supposed to be meeting for the first time. I decided I would demand a hug, head pats, and effusive praise when I was able to see him as Myne again.</p><p>He nodded to himself as if satisfied with something then grew serious. “Are you happy, Rose?”</p><p>“Yes, though I would be happier if I were able to see my family more.”</p><p>The wrinkles at the corners of his eyes became more pronounced as he gave me a warm yet heart-breaking smile. “I’m sure they feel the same. What about…” His gaze trailed over to Ferdinand, who’d just caught the last parue from the tree. They began to move to the next one as Dad finished his question. “Dino. Does he make you happy? Is he treating you right?”</p><p>I looked over at him, his beautiful profile standing out starkly against the snowy backdrop with his darker hair as he gazed up at the fruit Lutz was trying to drop. His eyes were lit with excitement, and though he seemed wary while talking with Kamil, I could tell he was enjoying himself. I hoped he was beginning to feel like a part of my family.</p><p>His joy since giving me his name until this very moment contrasted so sharply with the anxiety and pain he’d suffered when I was kidnapped and his anger, sorrow, and determination when fighting Lanzenave or confronting Gervasio that it made those terrible events feel like they’d happened in a different lifetime rather than just last week.</p><p>I thought about the time I’d spent with Ferdinand from when I first met him. His kindness was often hard to understand, but looking back, it was so clear and frankly astonishing how much he’d shown me even from our first meeting when he read the bible to me. I knew he’d gone out on a limb to secure me the reasonably comfortable life I’d had at the temple as a commoner blue shrine maiden, even going so far as to buck social norms to give me bedding. At the time, I hadn’t understood how big of a deal that was, but knowing now just how much he tried to adhere to social conventions, it was almost mind boggling to think he’d go so far for me.</p><p>I knew it pained him having to separate me from my family, and while I wish it didn’t have to happen, I was grateful he and Sylvester afforded me the opportunity to protect those most precious to me, even if I couldn’t be with them anymore. Even now, all these years later, he was working hard to reunite us.</p><p>I wasn’t sure which timeline many of my other memories of him belonged to, but they were all still him. He’d saved me when I was poisoned, watched over me and those close to me while I slept in my jureve, ensured I was fully prepared for the Academy, worked to give me as much time as possible with my new noble families, tried his best to grant my selfish wishes, and toppled the country’s regime to save me when I was kidnapped. Even more, he’d lived this life not once but twice, devoting his second chance to making sure I got to live a long, happy life with the people I loved, embracing selfishness for perhaps the first time to include himself among them.</p><p>He wasn’t perfect by any means. He was manipulative, secretive, distrustful, paranoid, possessive, and suffered unduly under a mountain of trauma. But he was making an effort to change.</p><p>This was the man who protected me, guided me, and accepted me, past lives and all. He was the one I’d given my name to and the one who held my heart.</p><p>And as I’d realized while I was making my name stone, he was the man I loved more than any other.</p><p>“Yes,” I said, letting my heart show in my expression. “He makes me happy, and he treats me well.”</p><p>At that moment, Ferdinand turned to us, another freshly-picked parue in his hands, and he froze as his eyes met mine. A moment later, they filled with something similar to the feelings swelling in my breast, and they warmed until the heat threatened to melt all the snow in Yurgenschmidt. While I couldn’t fight the blush this brought to my cheeks, I was suddenly grateful for his nigh-unreadable mask. I didn’t want anyone else seeing what was so clearly visible to me.</p><p>Especially Dad. He’d definitely have killed him if he knew what had passed between us in that brief eternity.</p><p> </p><p>As fourth bell approached, the parue trees began to stretch skyward, prompting Kamil to give up on the last fruit he was trying to pick and scramble down the elongating trunk. Ferdinand watched with silent fascination, his darting eyes committing every second of this strange phenomenon to memory. He had a sharp intake of breath when the remaining fruits blasted off in random directions, quickly burrowing under the snow. When the trees at last vanished into the pale blue sky, he stared up at the empty space in awe for several moments.</p><p>“And these only appear on sunny days in winter?” he asked.</p><p>“Yep,” Lutz said. “Most people just drink the juice and use the leftover flesh for chicken feed. When I was a kid, we’d get so much of the dried out fruit in exchange for eggs that I was actually jealous of the chickens for getting so much food. An old friend of mine showed me how to turn the leftovers into parue cakes, though, and they’re now a favorite of both our families.”</p><p>I nodded, a warm feeling of nostalgia washing over me. “I hear they’re served in the temple orphanage as well.”</p><p>Ferdinand raised an accusatory brow at me as he said, “Is that so? How fascinating.”</p><p>I just shrugged at him. We didn’t get very many parues to begin with, and they were a special treat for all the good boys and girls in our orphanage. And my retainers, not that I could ever admit that now. Besides, he got all kinds of special treats, including double consommé! He didn’t have any room to complain.</p><p>“We can see about making some later,” I said in a minor effort to appease him. He seemed to perk up a bit at that.</p><p>We divided the spoils among us and then went back through the South Gate, my heart sinking all the while. I wasn’t ready to say goodbye.</p><p>Ferdinand picked up on my mood instantly, and when we neared the place we would part ways, he held out a hand to Dad, who shook it firmly. “Thank you for today, Gunther,” he said. “I look forward to when Rose and I can come visit you and your family in the future.”</p><p>I nearly gasped, but Dad’s jaw dropped as Lutz’s eyes widened. After several long moments, tears suddenly started streaming down Dad’s face, and he yanked Ferdinand forward, catching him off guard and making him nearly stumble into him. Dad gathered him in one of his signature bear hugs as he wept, thanking him over and over.</p><p>Ferdinand looked to me for help, but I could only stand there and cry silently. I wanted more than anything to throw myself into that embrace, too, but I wasn’t sure if that would count as treating each other like family. I knew that was Dad’s intent when he hugged Ferdinand.</p><p>He turned to Lutz, but he just shook his head and shrugged.</p><p>“Dad, why are you crying? What’s wrong?” Kamil asked.</p><p>That seemed to bring Dad back, and he let go of Ferdinand, clapping him on the shoulder instead. “Nothing’s wrong, Kamil,” he said.</p><p>“Yeah, you know how Gunther can just get emotional sometimes.”</p><p>“Then why is Miss Rose crying, too?”</p><p>“Ah, sorry,” I said, dabbing at my eyes with my coat sleeve. I didn’t want to risk pulling out my much-too-nice handkerchief while I was in disguise. “When I see someone cry, I sometimes do, too.”</p><p>My little brother didn’t look convinced, but he dropped it when I reached down and ruffled his hair. “It was nice meeting you, Kamil.”</p><p>He ducked under my hand and gave me a slightly resentful look as he held his head. “Yeah. Nice to meet you, too, Miss Rose.” His face lit up, though, when he addressed Ferdinand. “It was nice meeting you, too, Mr. Dino! Can you tell me more about hunting feybeasts next time?”</p><p>He seemed a bit startled by the seething jealousy I was sending his way. “I don’t know that I have many more stories to tell…”</p><p>“I bet you’ll hunt a ton more before we see you next! You can tell me about those.”</p><p>“Ah, perhaps.”</p><p>“Alright, that’s enough, Kamil,” Lutz said, also ruffling his hair and getting a similar reaction. “We’ll see you later, then.”</p><p>“Yes!” I said, my smile returning. “Until then, everyone!”</p><p>As we parted, I took Ferdinand’s hand and hummed to myself. “It seems Gunther thinks of you as part of the family now,” I said.</p><p>Ferdinand’s ears colored as he sighed. “That was a most uncomfortable experience.”</p><p>“You say that, but your grin says otherwise.”</p><p>He scoffed, immediately wiping the smile from his face.</p><p>“It’s not fair, though!” I pouted. “Why does Kamil like you so much more than me?!”</p><p>Ferdinand shook his head. “Do not ask me. The commoner mind is truly unfathomable. I don’t believe anyone has ever liked me upon first meeting me, save for Sylvester, and that was more the idea of what I represented rather than myself as a person.”</p><p>“Hmm? I liked you! In fact, I liked you a lot! You read the bible to me and taught me how to read new words.”</p><p>He furrowed his brows at me. “Was that not merely your enjoyment of reading rather than anything to do with me?”</p><p>I tilted my head at him, a bit confused. “Do you not recall how you placed me in your lap or how happy you were the whole time? I was honestly a little surprised when I saw you next because I wasn’t expecting you to be so much of a [sour puss].”</p><p>Narrowing his eyes, he said, “I may not know what that phrase is, but I can surmise its connotation.”</p><p>I quickly covered my cheek with my free hand.</p><p>Sure enough, right before we activated our amulets again, he pinched them thoroughly, even having the audacity to complain that it wasn’t as pleasurable as it used to be.</p><p>“Well, excuse me for having all my baby fat travel to my chest instead!”</p><p>That earned me yet more cheek pinching and a lecture, though I noticed his eyes kept drifting down the whole time.</p><p>It made me a little worried that maybe he’d start pinching something else after our starbind. The shiver that sent down my spine was equal parts fear and anticipation.</p><p> </p><p>The next day was my meeting with the Gutenbergs, the Gilberta Company, Frieda, Mom, and Tuuli, but before they came in the afternoon, I met with my gray robes, chefs, and Hartmut that morning.</p><p>“So this winter, Ferdinand and I will be leaving for a new duchy. I don’t know what their temple is like, but I do plan on becoming High Bishop. However, I’ll be at the Royal Academy for the majority of the winter, so I won’t be there to help with reforms.”</p><p>“Oh, rest assured, Lady Rozemyne,” Hartmut said. “I certainly will be.”</p><p>“Maybe not,” I said. At his devastated look, I quickly added, “I want you to marry Clarissa this summer since I only had permission to bring her to Ehrenfest. The new Zent will be High Bishop, and he’s already married, so he may do away with the rule saying priests can’t marry. If that’s the case, then I wouldn’t mind if you wanted to stay in the temple. If not, then you couldn’t be High Priest.”</p><p>He blinked at me for just a moment before he gave me his typical smile. “I understand, my lady. I shall tie my stars this summer as you wish.”</p><p>Nodding, I turned back to my gray robes. “That said, I do plan to enact the same reforms I did here upon my return from the Academy, including establishing a workshop in the orphanage. If you want to come with me but don’t wish to go to an unfamiliar temple, I am willing to purchase you like I did Rosina. Wilma, I would be especially interested in purchasing you as my personal artist.”</p><p>“Oh, my, Lady Rozemyne!” she gasped. “I… I…”</p><p>“You need not make the decision now, but if you choose not to come with me, I have no doubt that my mother, Lady Elvira, will purchase you instead.”</p><p>Wilma began to tremble, but she nodded. “Then, Lady Rozemyne, I would like for you to purchase me.”</p><p>I gave her a thankful smile as Hartmut made a note to arrange the paperwork later.</p><p>“I know some of you served Ferdinand before you came into my service. I have spoken with him, and he has agreed to extend the same offer. If you wish to go back into his service, he will gladly purchase you. This may work out better for the men since noble women do not typically have male attendants. Oh, but don’t worry. Since we’ll be binding our stars soon, you’ll serve in the same household either way.”</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne,” Fran asked, “how long will we have to make our decision?”</p><p>“I would like you to decide by the summer starbinding ceremony. We’ll need time to select and train replacements, after all, should you choose to come with me.”</p><p>They all nodded, their expressions serious as they considered their futures.</p><p>Turning to my chefs, I said, “I apologize, but I must have you come with me regardless. Your knowledge is simply too valuable. You may, of course, bring your family with you as well.”</p><p>They paled at first, but then Ella looked relieved. “So I can bring my mother, too.”</p><p>“But of course!”</p><p>“Thank you, Lady Rozemyne!”</p><p>I dismissed everyone to allow them time to process the news and then spoke with Hartmut to prepare for the next meeting.</p><p> </p><p>No one was surprised by the news Ferdinand and I were leaving Ehrenfest since I’d already told them to prepare for such an eventuality. They were surprised, however, that he was going to be Aub, and that we would be moving at the beginning of winter.</p><p>“Of course, I don’t expect any of you to move before the snow melts,” I said.</p><p>“Thank you for your consideration, Lady Rozemyne,” Benno said as he crossed his arms and bowed. “The Plantin Company will be ready to move the moment the roads are traversable. However, I must humbly beg your understanding that we will have to go inspect their lower city ahead of time to find a suitable space.”</p><p>“Of course,” I said. “I merely ask that you be ready by the end of fall. Half of the duchy has been sorely neglected since the civil war, and we desperately need to establish our main industries to help stabilize the economy there.”</p><p>The business people nodded, their expressions grim.</p><p>“Now, since you’ve had advance warning, I assume you already know which of you is coming and which is staying?”</p><p>Naturally, Benno, Mark, and Lutz were moving, as were Tuuli, Mom, Dad, and Kamil. Otto, Corinna, and their children also planned to come establish a branch of the Gilberta Company in Alexandria. Ingo would be staying behind since he owned his own workshop, but his apprentice Dimo would come in his stead. Johann didn’t have any other patrons, so he would come, of course, but I had to order Zack to accompany me to get him out of his contract. Thankfully, even though Josef was meant to be the successor to the ink workshop, another worker, Horace, could take his place. This was fortunate since nothing could stop Heidi, Josef’s wife, from charging across the border.</p><p>Frieda, however, was unsure what to do. “I’m the proprietress of the Italian restaurant, and I’m under contract with a noble. As much as I would like to go try my hand at establishing a new business in another duchy, I’m afraid that simply won’t be possible.”</p><p>I shook my head. “I happen to know the laynoble who holds your contract. He works with our printing industry. I can ask to buy out your contract if you wish, or I can talk with him about coming with us as a retainer. His brother is already one of my guard knights, after all.” Her eyes flicked to Damuel and then back to me. “Whether you decide to come or not, I would like to purchase one or two chefs to help establish the new restaurant. My fiancé is rather fond of Liese, and I know you work well with her.”</p><p>It was a bit dirty to threaten to take her head chef, but come on! How could I leave Frieda behind when she could do so much to help turn around old Werkestock’s financial situation? Besides, if anyone could figure out supply chain issues for food in a neglected duchy, it was definitely her.</p><p>She seemed to understand what I was getting at, and she got that gleam in her eye whenever she smelled an insane amount of profit to be had. “Lady Rozemyne, might I have three days to consider how I would like to handle my contract?”</p><p>“I’ll give you two weeks,” I said, knowing it may take some time for her to meet with Henrik.</p><p>
<em>Yes! Mob boss restaurateur GET!</em>
</p><p>“Thank you all for coming today. I thank you ever so much to those who have chosen to stay with me, and I look forward to hearing from you in the near future, Frieda. Effa, Corinna, and Tuuli, please stay behind.”</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne?”</p><p>“Yes, Lutz?” I asked, surprised he spoke out of turn after being dismissed. More surprisingly, Hartmut, who was acting in his capacity as my scholar, didn’t take issue.</p><p>“Can I speak with you?”</p><p>“Yes, of course,” I said, taking note of Benno’s slight exasperation. “Fran, please show Lutz downstairs. I will speak with him after I finish with my other exclusives.”</p><p>With the room mostly cleared, I eyed Hartmut, Damuel, Angelica, Matthias, and Laurenz. They were all I had with me of my noble retainers at the moment. “What is discussed from this point forward does not leave this room. Understand?”</p><p>“Yes, Lady Rozemyne!”</p><p>Turning back to my now-nervous guests, I said, “Effa, I need a cape like my guard knights are wearing dyed the same color as my hair. How soon could you have this prepared?”</p><p>She looked at Damuel’s cape, the closest one to her, and thought for a moment. “Cloth of that quality will take time to weave. I could have the finished product ready by the end of Spring.”</p><p>My heart fell a little at that. I knew it would take time, but that didn’t give me long at all to embroider all the crazy magic circles and the obfuscating patterns before we moved to Alexandria.</p><p>“Corrina, Tuuli, I hear you’ve been looking into metal-laced fabric. How is that coming along?”</p><p>“We weren’t able to find the exact same metal,” Corrina said, “but we were able to achieve a similar effect.”</p><p>“Could you provide me a sample?”</p><p>“Yes, I can have one sent once we return.”</p><p>I imagined the cloth wouldn’t be impenetrable to mana, but it might be resistant if the metal had low mana to begin with. If that were the case, then I planned to put a hidden liner of it in Ferdinand’s new cloak. As much as he valued practicality, I didn’t think he’d appreciate me using the silver cloth from Lanzenave.</p><p>“I’ll also need to order high quality thread the same color as my eyes as well as some in light blue.”</p><p>Tuuli grinned. “Would that be in the same shade as your fiancé’s hair?”</p><p>I nodded. “Yes, I want to present him with a new cape in the color of the new duchy before we leave this winter.”</p><p>“Oh, it’s for him?” Mom asked. “Then I will certainly put my all into it.”</p><p>I smiled at her, so glad they were accepting of him. Part of me has been worried that my family would be put off by his closed expression, awkward manner, or age. However, none of that seemed to bother them. Of course, they had been in contact upon occasion, so they knew how he cared for me.</p><p>Hartmut passed over the order form, and I dismissed them, sad to see my mom go. It was the first time in years that I’d seen her, but I could do nothing more than I already had with the contract tying my hands and my retainers present.</p><p>Once they left, I had Gil bring Lutz. “What can I do for you?”</p><p>He swallowed, gathered his courage, and said, “I would like to request permission to purchase Gil.”</p><p>“Huh?!” he exclaimed.</p><p>I sat in silence, having a minor processing error. “I see. May I ask why?”</p><p>“We’ve been working together since the Rozemyne Workshop was established, and he knows printing and paper making inside and out. We’ve developed a lot of new paper together, and he was instrumental in the early days when we traveled to set up new workshops. He would be an asset to the Plantin Company while we establish ourselves in a new duchy, and I would like to continue working with him in the future.”</p><p>I heard loud and clear what he left unsaid: <em>He’s my friend, and I want him to stay with me.</em></p><p>Turning to Gil, I asked, “What do you think about this, Gil?”</p><p>“Um… I… I would like to keep working with the Plantin Company, too, but…”</p><p>Ah, even as a grown man, he has the cutest puppy dog eyes. “Oh, please don’t worry about my feelings. You wouldn’t be betraying me in the least. In fact, you would still be serving my interests - filling the world with books. Of course, I would be happy to purchase you as well, but if you would prefer to go with Lutz, please do.”</p><p>“Then…” He looked down for a few moments before he met my eyes again. “I would like to go with Lutz.”</p><p>I smiled at him and then turned to Hartmut. “Please calculate his purchase price and draw up the contract. Lutz, you will receive an invitation once the contract is ready.”</p><p>He crossed his arms and thanked me before the two young men exchanged excited grins. I was glad things seemed to be working out.</p><p> </p><p>It only took Frieda three days to send me a letter, though I didn’t get it until the fourth day. It had been sent to the temple, but I’d already come back to the castle to attend the winter playroom. As soon as I read that she would prefer I buy out her contract if possible, I had Roderick send a request for a meeting with Henrik, and we met three days later in one of the side meeting rooms. Ferdinand decided to be present for it, which definitely made Henrik nervous.</p><p>“Henrik, I’ve called you to discuss a couple of matters,” I said. “First, however, we must insist that you swear on your schtappe that what we will discuss will not leave this room.”</p><p>He paled but did as asked.</p><p>“Good. Now, at the beginning of next winter, Ferdinand and I will be leaving Ehrenfest for a new duchy where he will become Aub.” I waited for the shocked glaze to fade from his eyes before I continued. “You have done excellent work for the printing industry, specifically helping facilitate communications between commoners and nobles. If you would be amenable, I would like to take you on as an official retainer. That would mean you and your family would move to the new duchy with us in the winter as well.”</p><p>His eyes grew wide as they traveled to where his brother stood behind me.</p><p>“Damuel will be coming with me,” I said. We’d only had the briefest of conversations about it because I wasn’t giving him much of a choice. There was a non-zero chance that if he stayed behind, he would meet with an unfortunate accident because he knew too much.</p><p>“Might I have some time to discuss this with my wife?”</p><p>“Of course. I would like your decision by the end of summer. If you choose to come, you will be responsible for training your replacement, so keep that in mind with your timeline.”</p><p>“Yes, Lady Rozemyne.”</p><p>“As for the other matter, I would like to discuss buying out Frieda’s contract.”</p><p>This caused Ferdinand to raise a brow at me, his expression saying, <em>We never discussed your buying a devouring child.</em></p><p>I sent one back saying, <em>Trust me.</em></p><p>Henrik, however, had already spoken to Frieda about it, so he just nodded his acceptance.</p><p>“Please inform Lady Elvira of the cost of the contract, including the price of all magic tools and feystones you provided to her.”</p><p>“Yes, Lady Rozemyne. Your generosity is most appreciated.”</p><p>Once he left, Ferdinand passed me a sound-blocking tool and said, “Explain.”</p><p>“I plan to have her establish a restaurant in our new duchy and handle various other related matters, like food supply chain issues.”</p><p>“She’s barely in her autumn, yes? You would trust such matters to one so young?”</p><p>I nodded, puffing out my chest. “No one is more diligent about turning a profit. She will absolutely find every way possible to optimize food transportation. Plus, we’re getting Liese as part of the deal.”</p><p>“The head chef of the Italian restaurant?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>He didn’t need to hear anything more.</p><p> </p><p>I met with my retainers individually once I returned to the castle. I’d met with Damuel first then Cornelius. He already knew about the move, but I wanted to confirm his choice to come with me.</p><p>“I don’t want you to feel pressured into coming by what Eckhart said or anything else. I know you’re going to get married to Leonore, and her wishes matter, too. If you want to stay in Ehrenfest, then—“</p><p>“Let me stop you there,” he said. “Leonore and I are coming with you. How is this even a question? Do you think I would abandon my little sister like that?” Under his breath, he muttered, “And with a fiancé like him?” Smirking at me, he said, “Sorry, Little Sister, but you’re stuck with me.”</p><p>“Just when I finally thought I could be rid of you,” I joked.</p><p>“Ha! It’ll take more than moving to a new duchy to chase me off.”</p><p>“Well, I suppose I can put up with you, then.” I paused for a moment, and with a sincere smile, I said, “Thank you, Cornelius. I’m glad you’re coming.”</p><p>He smiled back. “Yeah, me, too.”</p><p>I confirmed Leonore’s intentions immediately after.</p><p>When I met with Angelica, she didn’t hesitate or elaborate. She simply said, “I’m coming with you, Lady Rozemyne.” I wondered if she would bind her stars while she was in Ehrenfest so that both her family and mine could celebrate, but I didn’t bother to ask. Even if she were, she probably didn’t know, and I didn’t want to hear Ferdinand’s voice talking about another woman getting married.</p><p>Lieseleta, as the fiancée to one of my namesworn, was of course planning to come. Likewise, Clarissa was quick to agree to bind her stars to Hartmut this summer in order to follow me.</p><p>After Sylvester told the rest of our families about the changes, Rhiyarda was reassigned to Charlotte. Ottlie was choosing to stay behind since she was married to Florencia’s scholar. Honestly, I got the impression that she was glad to finally be rid of Hartmut. She very much exuded, “He’s your problem now.”</p><p>Also staying behind were Brunhilde, Judith, Berthilde, and Philine. While Brunhilde was saddened by the news, she’d already been planning to leave my service when she married Wilfried. None of the others were happy about the decision, but Philine took it especially hard. I certainly hadn’t expected her to act the way she did. After I explained again that I had to leave her behind because she was underaged, she asked, “So would you take me back into your service once I come of age?”</p><p>“Of course, Philine. I would gladly welcome you.”</p><p>“I thank you ever so much, Lady Rozemyne.” She stood, but rather than bow like I was expecting, she walked around the table. When she came to stand in front of Damuel, she reached out and grabbed the edge of his breastplate, shoving hard as she hooked a leg behind his knee. In his surprise, he toppled over. As they fell, she pulled out her schtappe, chanted, “<em>Messer,</em>” and then held it to his throat when they hit the ground.</p><p>“Give me a bride task,” she demanded, her voice hard and her tone dark.</p><p>He stared up at her with a mixture of shock, confusion, fear, and… was that a little arousal?</p><p>When he didn’t respond, she pushed the knife closer. “Bride task. Now.”</p><p>“U-uh, d-dye a ruelle fruit on the Night of Schutzaria.”</p><p>I slapped my palm against my face, a most unladylike, but understandable, loss of control. <em>Damuel, you idiot! Everyone knows you did that to propose to Bridgette! Seriously, how dense can you be?!</em></p><p>Philine stared at him for a long moment before she withdrew her knife and said, “Be ready to escort me at graduation.” With that, she stood, apologized for her unseemly display, and left.</p><p>“Wow,” Laurenz whistled. “Just when I thought your lady-killer skills couldn’t get any worse, here you come with a shovel to drop that bar even lower.”</p><p>Matthias closed his eyes and sighed as Damuel stammered, “I-it what the first thing that came to mind! I mean, she was proposing at knife point! It’s not like I had time to think! How did this even happen?! I thought she liked Roderick!”</p><p>“Idiot,” Matthias muttered.</p><p>Mother was going to grill me about the whole thing, but I didn’t even want to tell her. I was so embarrassed for Philine. Hopefully, Mother would at least have him come up with a bride task that wasn’t related to his ex in the novel.</p><p>Next, I brought in Emilia, Ludolf, and Rainer in turn, explaining that I would be made their new guardian and that we would be moving to a new duchy. Once Emilia found out it would have a warmer climate, she got excited, saying she would be able to continue her training even in winter. Even with conditioning, she couldn’t go outside in a blizzard. Ludolf was nervous but glad he’d still be with his friend. Rainer, however, didn’t really seem to understand. I’d have to work on him in the coming months. In the meantime, I tasked Laurenz and Roderick with helping the boys prepare and Gretia with Emilia.</p><p>When I met with Nikolaus, I brought our father as well.</p><p>“Nikolaus, this is the first time we’ve really gotten to talk since the incident,” I said. “How are you doing?”</p><p>Shaking his head, he looked away with a bitter grimace. “Sister, I’m so sorry. I was suppose to protect you, and yet you still–”</p><p>“None of that, Nikolaus,” I said. “Those were extraordinary circumstances. Even our father would have been hard pressed to do any better were Sylvester in my place. Right, Father?”</p><p>He nodded and gave his son a hesitant pat on his shoulder. “Indeed, Nikolaus. You have no reason to feel ashamed. Not only was your perceived enemy a prince, but you faced the arduous task of fighting defensively in order not to bring suspicion upon your lady. It’s much easier to fight without restraint, and yet you managed to refrain from killing anyone while simultaneously keeping everyone on your side relatively unharmed, against Sovereignty soldiers, no less! As a first year! That is an impressive feat and one you should be proud of. I know I am.”</p><p>The way Nikolaus’s entire face lit up warmed my heart, but it cut me all the same. My little brother wanted so badly to be loved and praised by our father. It was so unfair that Father took me in, a completely unrelated commoner, but he abandoned his own flesh and blood because his mother belonged to a different faction. Had I not stepped in, it was entirely possible little Nikolaus would have been executed.</p><p>“Yes, Nikolaus,” I said, “you are a large part of the reason my attendants and scholars are still alive. I thank you ever so much for protecting them while following my unreasonable orders to preserve the life of your enemies.”</p><p>He became flustered as I bowed my head to him, waving his hands as he said, “No, Sister, please! Raise your head! I-I get it, okay, so please!”</p><p><em>Ah, he’s so adorable when he’s embarrassed!</em> Little brothers really were too cute to ignore.</p><p>“Now, back to my original question,” I said. “How are you doing?”</p><p>Shaking his head, he said, “I’m fine. There’s no reason to worry about me. I should be asking you that question.”</p><p>I gave him a refined giggle and said, “I’m quite well, thank you. However, there were many, many consequences of the Sovereign knights’ actions at that time that we need to discuss.” He sat up straighter as I continued, “First, Aub Dunkelfelger obtained his Wisdom and will be crowned Zent, likely before the end of Spring.”</p><p>His eyes widened, but he otherwise hid his surprise well.</p><p>“As a result, he will be redrawing many borders, taking away territory from some, giving some to others, and creating two new duchies. Ferdinand will be Aub of one of these, and he and I will move there this winter.”</p><p>“What?” he gasped. “Sister, you’re leaving?!”</p><p>I nodded. “As I am your guardian, of course I can bring you with me if you want. However, if you wish to stay, then that can be arranged as well.”</p><p>“I want to go with you!” he said without a moment’s hesitation. “Please, Sister! Take me with you!”</p><p>I glanced at Father to gauge his reaction. He seemed happy that Nikolaus was being taken care of, if a little dejected that he would be leaving. Part of me resented that. Did he really have the right to feel sad his son was leaving when he’d all but thrown him away? Had he ever gone to see him when I hadn’t arranged it? Did he give him anything, even words of praise, without my prompting?</p><p>With some effort, I set aside those bitter feelings. I understood the social pressure behind his actions. As vice commander of the Knight’s Order and Sylvester’s guard knight, he had little leeway with how he treated the children of criminals. Still, he could have chosen to show his actual son some compassion when he needed him.</p><p>“Very well, Nikolaus,” I said. “I will bring you with me to our new duchy. Oh, I’ll have to embroider a new cape for you! Hmm… Well, I guess I can do it like I did this past winter and just work on it while we’re at the Academy. You won’t receive the new one until the gifting ceremony, anyway. If you have any special circles you want me to add, please collect them and give them to me once we arrive at the new dorms.”</p><p>His cheeks tinged pink as he nodded with a shy grin. “Yes, Sister.”</p><p><em>Ah! So adorable! He’s going to be fighting off the girls here soon, and then he’ll need a whole new cape for his future wife to embroider for him.</em> That left me feeling a little bereft, and I wondered if this was what it was like to watch your child grow up and get married. Were Father, Mother, Sylvester, and Florencia experiencing something similar for me?</p><p>The look in Father’s eye as I discussed our plans for leaving suggested he was. That was when it really hit me that I was about to leave behind such a large part of my family.</p><p>That night, I had to lock myself in my hidden room for a full bell to cry. I didn’t want to say goodbye to my family. Father could be a bit stand-offish, but that was mostly due to fulfilling his duty as guard knight and vice commander. He was always warm when I was at home with the Linkbergs. Mother was the perfect noblewoman, and she’d spent so much time helping me develop and maintain my noble persona. She was also the person who held me the most often when I was an emotional wreck as a child. If it weren’t for her, I think I would have gone crazy trying to live in noble society. She had been my safe haven in a sea of empty interactions with porcelain masks.</p><p>Sylvester sometimes got on my nerves, but he was always bending over backwards for me, protecting me as much as he could - sometimes more than he should - and giving me more freedom than any other archduke would ever allow. Now that I was more well-versed in navigating noble society, I understood that nearly anyone else in his position would have killed my family to tie up loose ends, but he’d instead kept them alive and named me High Bishop in part so I would have a means to see them upon occasion. There was no way Tuuli would have been able to come to the castle until very recently. Even so, I continued to meet with her in the temple. (Ferdinand met with her there, too, whenever he wanted to order me another hairpin in secret. It made me insanely jealous he would see her without me, but it was sweet enough to give me diabetes, so I let it slide.)</p><p>Florencia had played a large part in my education as well. Watching her taught me a lot about being First Wife, which I hadn’t known at the time I would need. She also provided another perspective on women’s socializing and helped train Charlotte and me to navigate all sorts of situations. She was quieter than Mother, but as I got to know her, I learned she was rather crafty, and she taught me the proper way to hold someone’s leash, when you could let go, and how to rein them in when necessary. It’d proven surprisingly useful when dealing with Hartmut and Clarissa. I don’t think I would ever forget the day during one of these discussions when she confided in me that she wished she’d already learned these lessons when Wilfried was born.</p><p>“Maybe then I wouldn’t have lost him to that vile woman,” she’d whispered, looking down into her teacup with an openly pained expression.</p><p>“You were so young at the time, though,” I’d told her, “and the situation was completely out-of-standard. I don’t think anyone could fault you for not knowing how to handle it, especially since you were in a new duchy. You should have received support from the former First Wife, but instead, she used that power against you.”</p><p>She’d shaken her head before meeting my eyes with a determined stare. “That is no excuse, Rozemyne. Whatever roles we have we must execute flawlessly, regardless of the situations we find ourselves in. My failure nearly saw my son disinherited and banished to the temple. Even now, he bears a black mark because I let her take him from me and didn’t convince Sylvester to stand up to her. While it is easy to hide behind youth and inexperience, every action a first wife makes has far-reaching consequences, and we have to take ownership of that. Please, Rozemyne, learn from my mistakes. Be mindful of your decisions. You already know your choice to award everyone equally regardless of faction is unconventional and can lead to friction with your support base. Even the smallest actions can have pronounced outcomes. Scheduling tea with one person a day before another might cause bitterness. Giving too polite of a smile can make others assume you’re placid or weak. Even choosing to soothe Brenwarmme’s flames by inviting Beischmacht at the wrong time might cause you to be unable to supply the foundation if something were to occur before Entrinduge visited. I myself have had to spurn Sylvester’s advances more than once. Otherwise, I might have found myself carrying Geduldh’s burden when–”</p><p>I really wished I could forget the last part of that conversation. Adoptive or not, no one wanted to think about their parents having sex. <em>Someone please give me back the awkward sex ed classes and dirty magazines I found under Shuu’s bed! Anything to save me from having to talk about winter with my mothers!</em></p><p>Of course, my parents weren’t the only ones I was leaving behind. Despite whatever relationship we had in the past timeline, Wilfried was a good older brother to me. I was worried about leaving him alone with how honest and trusting he was. I hoped Brunhilde would be able to keep him straight.</p><p>Dear Charlotte was just as much an angel to me as Tuuli. Just looking at her smile was enough to heal my soul. Even though I was the older sister, she was such an inspiration to me. She was such a strong young woman, and she worked so hard.</p><p>Little Melchior had been my duckling after he got baptized. The way he looked up to me made me want to try harder, and I loved talking about the books he read with him. It was always a delight to see him light up whenever I gave him a new picture book. He was adorable in a way completely different from Nikolaus.</p><p>And then there was Lamprecht, who’d picked me up the first time he met me, finagled his way into visiting me at the temple so he could eat lunch, and volunteered to be my sparring partner when I started learning proper swordplay, despite how weak I was compared to all the knights. He was sometimes awkward and a little dense, but I could tell he cared about me in a way Eckhart and Cornelius simply didn’t. While Eckhart and I got along just fine, I knew he viewed me only in relation to how useful I was to Ferdinand. Cornelius saw me as the exasperating little sister he had to protect. Lamprecht, however, seemed to feel the same way about me that I did about Charlotte or to a lesser extent Kamil. For him, I was a little ray of sunshine who listened to his poorly-told stories and went out of her way to make his wife feel welcomed. (I didn’t have the heart to tell him I’d been completely motivated by fish for the latter.) My relationship couldn’t be described as “deep” with him, but it was warm and fuzzy, and I would miss him all the same.</p><p>As I cried at the devastating loss that was crushing me from the inside, I wanted desperately to go to Ferdinand’s hidden room, curl up in his lap, and bury my face in his neck as he held me close and stroked my hair. Since I was in the castle, however, that wasn’t an option. Instead, I had to let my emotions overwhelm me alone.</p><p>Thankfully, neither Lieseleta nor Gretia said anything about my red, swollen eyes when I emerged from my hidden room.</p><p> </p><p>The day after that, I gathered all of my namesworn to discuss the future with them. Part of me couldn’t believe I had six in total - Gretia, Roderick, Matthias, Laurenz, Muriella, and Anneliese.</p><p>After thanking everyone for coming, I once again explained the situation with getting a new Zent and moving to a new duchy in the winter. They already knew, but I wanted to state it again in case there were parts they might have missed.</p><p>“Of course, I want you all to come with me, but if you would rather stay in Ehrenfest, I will respect your wishes.”</p><p>They all looked at each other, and then Gretia said, “My lady, we are all namesworn to you. Of course, we will follow you.”</p><p>“Yes, let’s discuss that,” I said. They all tensed. “I’m aware most of you no longer have families, and you’re considered the children of criminals. If you stay in Ehrenfest, you would likely have to swear your name to one of the archduke family members. If nothing else, I know Aub Ehrenfest would accept your names if you want to remain here.</p><p>“That said, as you already know, I swore my name to Ferdinand after we returned from Ahrensbach. My life is in his hands. That means each of yours is as well. However, he is older than any of us, and he doesn’t lead the most healthy lifestyle. He will also be Aub of a new duchy that has reason to be hostile to him. You, of course, will not be children of criminals there. You can start over with a clean slate. Therefore, if you choose to come with me, I will return your name upon our arrival in the new duchy this winter.”</p><p>They all gaped at me, several gasping in shock.</p><p>“Lady Rozemyne!” Gretia cried, tears welling in her eyes. “Y-you don’t wish to hold our names? Have we done something to displease you?”</p><p>“You already discussed swearing your name to Lord Ferdinand with us,” Laurenz said, “and we all agreed to it. You don’t need to give us back our names for that reason.”</p><p>I shook my head. “That’s not the only reason. I will be counting on you to perform crucial duties in our new duchy, just like Ferdinand will be counting on his retainers. If something were to happen to him, all of us would perish, plunging the duchy into utter chaos. Ferdinand won’t be returning any of the names he holds, so we would lose not only our Aub but the First Wife, Justus, Eckhart, Janrik, and Lasfam. That will already be a crippling blow. If we lose all of you, too, I can’t even imagine what state that would leave the duchy in. I can only move forward with confidence knowing that you along with my other retainers will still be there should the worst happen.</p><p>“In addition to that, I will one day have children, and I don’t want to leave them alone and unprotected. I know this is selfish, but I want each of you to be there to protect them and look after them should Ferdinand and I ascend the towering staircase too soon.”</p><p>I looked at Laurenz and Annelise. “Besides, if something were to happen to Ferdinand, Bertram and Tobias would be left alone. Wouldn’t it be too much for Lieseleta to take them in if she also had just lost her husband? I can’t bear the thought of putting everyone through such hardship.”</p><p>Bowing my head to all of them, I said, “Again, I know this is selfish, but please, would you respect my wishes in this? I greatly value your honor and loyalty. I don’t want you to think of this as me rejecting you or looking down on you in any way.”</p><p>Silence reigned for an agonizing eternity before Matthias said in a soft voice, “Please, Lady Rozemyne, lift your head. You don’t need to bow to us or beg anything from us. If you think it’s best to return my name, then I will take it back, so long as you continue to let me serve you.”</p><p>I tried to keep my noble mask in place as I looked up, but I felt the tears stinging my eyes as my eyebrows twitched and my lip trembled.</p><p>“I’m going, too,” Gretia said, trying to give me an encouraging smile.</p><p>“Naturally, since Janrik is going, so am I,” Annelise said.</p><p>“Likewise with my little brother and Gretia,” Laurenz said.</p><p>Muriella placed a hand on her cheek and said, “I can’t possibly miss the ending of such a wonderful romance story. Of course, I have to come along and observe!”</p><p>Roderick gave her a strange look but nodded at me. “With or without my name stone, my life is in your hands, Lady Rozemyne. I will follow you wherever you go.”</p><p>As my composure crumpled, Matthias quickly passed me a sound-blocking tool and turned away, spreading his cape like I’d done for him the night his mother died. “Please don’t tell Lord Ferdinand,” he muttered. “Lieseleta will forgive me, but he never will.”</p><p>That made me laugh through my tears.</p><p>—--------</p><p>That summer, after the borderlines had been redrawn, Ferdinand left to dye Alexandria’s foundation as per Zent Werdekraf’s order. Not long after, I received an invitation to join Florencia and Mother for tea. I couldn’t remember the last time it had been just the three of us, so I was looking forward to it.</p><p>After we got the pleasantries out of the way, Mother erected a sound-blocking barrier and then sighed forlornly. “I suppose this is just a preview of what it will be like once Lord Ferdinand is no longer in Ehrenfest. How I will dearly miss that man. I was so looking forward to welcoming him as my son-in-law.”</p><p>“He’ll still be your son-in-law,” I said.</p><p>“Oh, it’s not the same at all. I won’t be able to dote on him outside of Interduchy Tournaments and the occasional visit to Alexandria.”</p><p>Florencia gave a refined giggle as she said, “My, but won’t we both miss being able to dote on Rozemyne even more?”</p><p>Embarrassed, I brought my cup to my lips and took a long sip to avoid having to make eye contact with either of them.</p><p>“Yes, but that’s not why we’re here today,” Mother said. “Ordinarily, we would wait a couple more years, but since you’re leaving us so soon, we have to do it now.”</p><p>“And better to do it while Lord Ferdinand is away,” Florencia agreed.</p><p>I raised a questioning brow, and Mother said, “It’s time to complete your ladies’ education. We’re going to teach you how to properly dote on your Dark God.”</p><p>“While ensuring you enjoy the blessings of Brenwarmme and Beischmacht,” Florencia added.</p><p>I nearly spat out my tea. “Wh-wh-what?!”</p><p>“Oh, dear, how unbecoming!” Mother admonished me. “This is why this conversation normally happens much later. I know you’re not quite ready for it, but when else can we have it without fear of interruption?”</p><p>Florencia gave me a wry smile. “Or fear that you’ll attempt to put these teachings into practice before you greet the Supreme Couple.”</p><p>“I would never!” I gasped.</p><p>Covering her mouth with a delicate hand, she replied, “Oh, Rozemyne, you can’t fool me. I’ve recognized the heat of Brenwarmme’s flames in your eyes when you’ve looked upon Lord Ferdinand. How do you think I received both his and Beischmacht’s blessings when I reacquired my protections?”</p><p>I covered my flushed face with my hands as I tried desperately to teleport myself away with willpower alone.</p><p>“Come now, Rozemyne,” Mother said. “There’s nothing to be embarrassed about. Winter is a perfectly natural part of life, so long as it occurs in its proper time, of course.”</p><p>Did they really think I was going to try to jump his bones the second he returned? I couldn’t even get the man to kiss me, and he knew I was actually fifteen already!</p><p>Reluctantly, I lowered my hands and decided to face this trial of Glucklitat head on. The more I fought it, the longer the torture would continue.</p><p>“Now then,” Florencia said, “there can be far more to welcoming winter than letting your Dark God’s sword meet your challice. You can’t forget the importance of Geduldh’s jewel. You remember that from our earlier lessons about the differences between men’s and women’s bodies, yes?”</p><p>My face flushed with an entirely different kind of embarrassment. “Yes, I know about the jewel.” I had grown <em>intimately</em> familiar with it after seeing Ferdinand in those tight pants for the first time.</p><p>“Of course, your Dark God can polish it with his hands, but if he uses his mouth–”</p><p>
<em>Verdrenna! Please! Strike me down now!</em>
</p><p>By the time I left the tea party three bells later, I had learned far, far too much about my mothers’ kinks.</p><p>And Florencia had been right. I absolutely wanted to try some of them. I sent a prayer to Verfuhremeer, asking her to cool my passion before Ferdinand returned. Otherwise, his chastity wouldn’t be long for this world.</p>

<p>Socializing once Ferdinand’s break was over was nothing but a headache. The knights swarmed him wherever he went, asking for more details about the fight in Ahrensbach, talking about defending the city, or bragging about their deeds of valor on the border. Meanwhile, whenever he got cornered by the Liesegangs, they would bombard him with demands to extract reparations from Aub Ehrenfest and Ahrensbach for their undue suffering, despite the fact their provinces weren’t targeted, and nearly all combatants were stopped at the gates. If anything, they were mildly inconvenienced by having to evacuate to the knight building. He found himself more than once thinking he was glad he wouldn’t have to deal with their petty politics for much longer. The new Alexandria likely wouldn’t be much better, however, with nobles from the Sovereignty, Werkestock, and Scharfer suddenly being thrust together under one cloak.</p><p>At least those from the former Veronica faction were happy to avoid him. They apparently feared he would lash out against them in some way since the Georginians had been hidden among them.</p><p>Just before the feast that celebrated spring, Henrik, Damuel’s brother, decided to become Rozemyne’s retainer. He would undoubtedly prove to be a boon as they established the printing industry in Alexandria since he was already familiar with the process and knew best how to facilitate communication between nobles and commoners. He hoped Fritz would come as well to help set up the Rozemne Workshop in the Alexandrian orphanage, but he imagined it would be some time before the gray robes made their decision.</p><p>The feast was a more subdued affair than normal since several giebes had already left thanks to the attack on the border and hadn’t returned. Soon after, Rozemyne and the other archduke candidates left to perform Spring Prayer, giving Ferdinand a brief break from tutoring them. He spent the extra time in his workshop. Rozemyne had mentioned the year before that one of the magic circles she found in the Book of Mestionora might allow them to communicate even while she was at the Academy.</p><p>Ever since her kidnapping, the thought of Rozemyne going beyond his reach terrified him. She’d agreed to send him ordonnanzes every evening during Spring Prayer before she got ready for bed to let him know she was safe. That was enough while they were both in Ehrenfest. Their current enemies had been eliminated, but who knew what villains lurked in the shadows of old Werkestock, waiting for a chance to ambush her at the Academy where he couldn’t protect her? Being able to speak with her at the end of the day would give him at least some peace of mind.</p><p>As he looked at the magic circle she’d shown him, he started making plans for the device he would etch it into. First, he made something similar to Raimund’s voice recorder, and it seemed to function as intended. Seeing it, however, brought to mind the shumil that she’d placed a recorder in, and he remembered once again Detlinde taking the doll away from her. Frowning, he sketched another design and then brewed two more devices, these shaped like shumils, one light blue and one dark blue. Even though this Rozemyne hadn’t lost the doll, it didn’t erase his desire to make it up to her, and these would be worthy substitutions.</p><p>While he was at it, he designed a pair of ear cuffs that would allow them to talk at a distance within a duchy, but he added a sound-blocking mechanism. They had but to pour a small amount of mana into the device to activate it. The receiver’s ear cuff would warm slightly when a message was sent. This way, they could have private conversations whenever necessary, even if she weren’t close enough to take a sound-blocking tool from him.</p><p>He lined up the new devices on his table and frowned. His chest was still filled with anxiety. What good would it do for her to contact him from the Academy if he could do nothing to protect her? She barely had any guard knights that would accompany her to the Royal Academy, and they wouldn’t have the time to find more before the term started.</p><p>Pulling out the Book of Mestionora, he looked for the magic circles the princess had made to create the automatons that helped manage the Royal Academy Library and compared them to the ones he and Hirschur had developed. He made several adjustments as he copied down the parts of the circles he decided to use, allowing them to speak fluently and ensuring they had the strength to defend Rozemyne. Once he completed the circle, he drew it again, this time focusing on lowering the mana cost. Raimund might have been able to find a more efficient way to use the mana necessary, but Rozemyne could easily handle the amount required to keep them activated and primed for battle.</p><p>Next, he moved on to designing the shumils, hiding as much of the magic circles adorning their bodies as possible to keep them from being stolen or circumvented. As he was thinking about color, his lips pulled into a smirk. If they were going to be the Wisdom of the Zent, he might as well play into it and build up both Rozemyne’s and Alexandria’s reputations. Once Aub Dunkelfelger released the information about obtaining the Book of Mestionora, everyone would understand the significance of golden shumils following Rozemyne. He spent the next few days creating and testing five of them.</p><p>Once Spring Prayer ended, he started tutoring the children once again. He would likely be gone for much of the summer dyeing the foundation of Alexandria, so he didn’t have long to teach Wilfried, Charlotte, and Melchior what they would need to excel at the Academy. Regretfully, the benefit he could provide his youngest nephew would be minimal since he wouldn’t have a schtappe for a few more years.</p><p>The first two lessons he conducted at the castle to allow them to settle back in after their journey across the duchy. Rozemyne and Wilfried each already knew all of the content for the archduke candidate course through sixth year as well as the content for their secondary courses. As such, he had them focus on material not taught at the Academy. For Rozemyne, that was advanced magic circles and brewing techniques. She wasn’t near Ferdinand’s level yet, but she could handle two time-saving magic circles. Her goal was to get to three before he left.</p><p>Wilfried focused on strategy and feybeast characteristics. He was well-versed in all the common feybeasts already, so he began working through Leonore’s and Matthias’s notes on the rarer species. Since Wilfried didn’t have his Wisdom, Ferdinand had Rozemyne copy and place a few sections from genius tacticians onto feyplant paper for him to study. He spent the majority of his time at his gewinnen board acting out the strategies.</p><p>Charlotte began working on sixth year content for the archduke candidate course, learning the spells to strengthen the border, protect her people, and destroy medals before going back to her box to practice using foundation magic since she’d just acquired the names of the Supreme Couple.</p><p>Melchior had already created his highbeast and learned the content for first and second year, so Ferdinand had him practice making Schutzaria’s shield. Unlike his brother and sister, he formed it as quickly as Rozemyne had, and it was surprisingly resilient. He weathered several of Ferdinand’s blows, finally losing strength after the eighth barrage of arrows. The boy’s retainers gave him reproachful looks, but they said nothing, having unsuccessfully argued against such “brutal” methods in the past.</p><p>“Wow!” Wilfried cried, having lost interest in his own studies in favor of watching the spectacle. He rushed over and patted his brother on the head. “That was amazing! I could only hold my shield for three of Uncle’s blows the first time I made it.”</p><p>Panting, Melchior gave him a weak smile. “It’s still nothing compared to Sister Rozemyne’s.”</p><p>“Eh, you can’t compare yourself to her. She’s not human.”</p><p>“I heard that!”</p><p>“Well, yeah. It’s not like I was whispering.”</p><p>Before they could devolve into a pseudo argument, Ferdinand said, “Enough. Melchior, here. Drink a potion.”</p><p>The boy grimaced but did as he was told, holding his mouth afterwards and squeezing his teary eyes shut against the taste.</p><p>Wilfried snorted and patted him on the back. “At least it was a kindness-infused one. The full-strength ones make the towering staircase visible.”</p><p>“There are worse ones?!”</p><p>Sighing, Ferdinand pinched the bridge of his nose and said, “Enough. Wilfried, return to your work. Melchior, we’ll begin on third year content. We can start with the prayer for divine protections. Once you’ve memorized it, we’ll have you perform the ceremony the next time you go to the temple.”</p><p>His eyes lit up. “Do you think I’ll get all of the elements?”</p><p>“I should expect so since you’ve been donating your mana to the divine instruments for a year.”</p><p>He practically glowed with excitement as he darted to the table to begin reading over the prayer. Of course, it took him hardly any time at all to memorize it since it was nearly identical to the one they used to fill the foundation. He then happily moved on to the study guides for third year content.</p><p>When their time together was coming to a close, Ferdinand asked Rozemyne to stay behind, so Wilfried, Charlotte, and Melchior bid them farewell. Cornelius stuck very close to his little sister as they moved to the library, which she seemed content to ignore, though Matthias and Eckhart both gave him stern glares. What he possibly thought Ferdinand would attempt with an underaged girl before so many retainers was beyond him.</p><p>When they entered, Rozemyne’s eyes widened as she gasped, “Ferdinand, are these library shumils? They–”</p><p>“Ah~!”</p><p>Lieseleta’s dreamy sigh cut off her lady’s question, and Matthias flushed Geduldh’s color as he beheld the look on his fiancée’s face. Ferdinand was a bit surprised by his reaction. He’d thought the pair had chosen to bind their stars for convenience’s sake.</p><p>Laurenz’s chuckling pulled her from whatever reverie she’d lost herself in, and as she noticed all the eyes on her, she blushed and covered her cheeks as she looked at the ground. “M-my apologies for my unseemly behavior.”</p><p>In an attempt to help her sister, Angelica stepped forward and announced, “Lieseleta loves shumils. She–”</p><p>“Not now, Darling,” Eckhart said, placing a hand on her shoulder.</p><p>“Hm? Was I not helping?”</p><p>“No, you weren’t.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>Lieseleta gave him a grateful smile, and he nodded in return.</p><p>Covering her grin with a delicate hand, Rozemyne walked over to one of the shumils and inspected it. “Are these for our library, Ferdinand?”</p><p>“No, they’re for your protection.”</p><p>Everyone gave him a questioning look, and he sighed, tapping the sighed of his head with frustration. “You will have only two guard knights when you go to the Royal Academy this year, no? I cannot allow you to remain unprotected, but we will not have time to determine the trustworthiness of anyone in our new duchy before the next term begins. This was the natural solution.”</p><p>Justus began to tremble, and he had to slap a hand over his mouth to keep from laughing out loud. Janrik gave Ferdinand an exasperated smile while most of Rozemyne’s retainers got a far off look in their eyes. Lieseleta, however, nodded enthusiastically. “Of course, Lord Ferdinand! This was the correct choice.”</p><p>“It is fortunate you think so,” he said, “as they will all require clothing before the start of the term.”</p><p>Rozemyne paled, and she turned her wavering eyes down as she muttered, “F-five sets? But I already have… When will I…?”</p><p>“Fear not, Lady Rozemyne!” Clarissa shouted. “We shall prepare worthy clothing for those guarding our goddess!”</p><p>“We already have the two from the library shumils Professor Adolphine returned to us. Perhaps if we send the designs for the others to your exclusive tailor,” Lieseleta said, “and if we can enlist the help of Lady Elvira, Lady Florencia, and their female retainers…”</p><p>“Anneliese can help as well,” Janrik said. “If you will provide me with some of the cloth and pattern you wish embroidered, I can deliver it to her to work on.”</p><p>“Brunhilde, could we get Mother to help?” Berthilde asked.</p><p>“Perhaps,” she hedged, placing a hand on her cheek. “If only Lady Hannelore were here.”</p><p>“What about Aurelia?” Eckhart asked. “She seems to be rather quick with a needle.”</p><p>“Do you suppose Lady Charlotte and her retainers would offer their assistance?” Matthias asked.</p><p>Ferdinand sighed as Rozemyne gave everyone an uncertain smile. “While it would be lovely to have so many people help, I’m not sure we can count on anyone’s assistance outside of my retainers. These shumils are not meant for an archduke candidate from Ehrenfest, after all.”</p><p>“Nonsense,” Cornelius snorted. “You think your family is planning to abandon you the moment you cross the border? Everyone wants to see you safe, Lady Rozemyne.”</p><p>“That’s right,” Justus said. “I’m certain Mother will offer her assistance as a parting gift to you.” Then, he gave her a wink. “I’m rather deft with a needle as well.”</p><p>Janrik gave him a dubious look as Eckhart shook his head with disgust. Ferdinand chose to ignore the inconvenient statement and said, “Your task is before you. Send word when you are ready to obtain their measurements.”</p><p>Rozemyne graced him with a noble smile as she thanked him and handed him a sound-blocking tool. When he took it, she asked, “Would it be too much trouble for you to make a sixth one once we’re in our new duchy?”</p><p>Raising a brow at her, he asked, “Why?”</p><p>“Because I think gathering the girls in the new dormitory together to work on the clothes of one of them will help everyone bond. We’ll need things like this to bring the students together and form some sort of cohesion.”</p><p>“Very well,” he agreed, recalling how others had mentioned something similar when they had to make the clothes for the library shumils. “I will have a sixth one prepared before your departure to the Royal Academy. Bear in mind you will need to keep them all filled while you’re there as I will not be present to help supply them.”</p><p>“Oh, I’m not worried about that at all,” she giggled. “I can guarantee you we will have several volunteers to supply them just so they can touch them. More importantly, though, what are their capabilities? Will they be able to work in our library?”</p><p>He smirked at her and said, “Yes, they’re able to do everything the ones at the Royal Academy do, but their speech is fluent. They can assist in the research facility we’ll have or act as an attendant. Their defensive capabilities are similar to the library shumils as well, though they’re more mana efficient and varied. I wanted to have them use lethal force if someone attacked you with the intent to kill, but I knew you would disapprove. They will, however, gravely injure and incapacitate any fool who raises a hand against you, and I will receive a message should you find yourself in a dangerous situation.”</p><p>“So it’ll send an ordonnanz?” she asked.</p><p>“Something similar,” he said. “It won’t work while you’re at the Royal Academy and I’m in Alexandria, but that will only be a problem for two more winters. I will show you how it works later.”</p><p>The gleam in her eye told him she understood he meant in his hidden room.</p><p> </p><p>A couple of weeks later, Rozemyne left the castle for the Linkbergs for a short stay before the Archduke Conference, and it was on her first night there that she appeared in Ferdinand’s hidden room. “Lieseleta isn’t giving me long,” she said by way of greeting.</p><p>“That’s fine,” he said, smirking as she pranced into his open arms and buried her face in his chest. It may have been shameless, but holding her was a balm to his tortured nerves after everything they’d suffered. It had been weeks since the kidnapping, and still he longed to know she was safe and alive and here.</p><p>Reluctantly, he eventually let her go and turned to the workbench to grab the first box. “Here,” he said, passing it to her.</p><p>She took it and pulled off the lid, tilting her head at the contents. “Oh, what’s this?” she asked, removing the ear cuff and holding it up to the light. His silence let her know he’d decided to treat her, so she pulsed a little mana into the device and studied the magic circle. “This use of the wind element… Is it a communication device?”</p><p>“Correct. Very good,” he said, smiling at her and enjoying the way she flushed with pleasure. “Put it on, and I’ll show you how it works.” He slipped his own into place and sent a trace amount of mana into it.</p><p>“Oh!” she gasped, her hand flying to her ear. “It’s warm.”</p><p>After she activated her cuff, Ferdinand felt a pulse on his end and said, “Now we can speak to each other without being overheard no matter where we are, so long as we’re in the same duchy.”</p><p>“Really?” she asked. “That’s amazing! The mana cost is so low, too, that I would have been able to use this even when my schtappe was sealed.”</p><p>“That was the weakness I intended to address, yes. Keep it on as often as you can.”</p><p>“Of course!” she agreed. “Now we can have secret conversations whenever we want. Ehehe! Well, so long as we’re both in the duchy. It’s too bad they won’t work when I’m at the Academy.”</p><p>He gave her an evil grin as he reached for another box to pass to her. Quirking a brow, she opened it and took out the little light blue shumil. “How adorable!” she squealed. “Look, he matches your hair color! And he even smells like you. I’m going to hold this every night when I go to sleep. Thank you, Ferdinand!”</p><p>“Fool,” he sighed, rubbing his temple as he tried to banish thoughts of her holding something with his scent against her ample chest while thinking of him. “It’s not merely a toy. It, too, is a communication device, but it works across duchy borders.”</p><p>“So you mean we can talk even while I’m at the Academy?” she gasped. “Oh, Ferdinand! This is wonderful!”</p><p>“I will expect verbal reports while you’re away. That will allow me to question you directly when you try to leave pertinent information out.”</p><p>“Wait, are you going to use this as a conduit for lectures?! No, it’s too cute to be turned into a perpetually unhappy lecture factory! It should be used exclusively for praise! Praise!”</p><p>“If you do not want a lecture, then do not give me a reason to lecture you.”</p><p>Puffing out her cheeks in a most unladylike fashion, she muttered, “Fine. I’ll just call him Mr. Lecture and be done with it.”</p><p>Heaving a sigh, Ferdinand pinched the bridge of his nose and replied, “You are unashamedly planning on causing me grief? Fine, then I shall name mine Lady Headache Report.”</p><p>“Eh? You made one for yourself?”</p><p>“Of course. How else would we be able to communicate?”</p><p>She shrugged. “I thought you would just have a plain magic tool, not a doll. Let me see it!”</p><p>With some reluctance, he pulled his from his desk drawer and presented it to her. Her cheeks tinged pink as she took it, and she gazed up at him through her lashes as she said, “It matches my hair color.”</p><p>“Of course it does,” he said, glancing away from the enticing vision. “Why wouldn’t it? It is meant solely for communication with you, so why would I not model it after you in some fashion? Your hair is a most appealing shade of blue, matching the night sky with your hairstick sparkling like stars with its feystones trailing down its length. It will be a lovely image to evoke as I speak with you while we are separated.”</p><p>Silence fell over the room, and with a sudden pang of regret, he realized he’d been so focused on trying to ward off Brenwarmme’s heat that he’d let his true feelings spill from his treacherous mouth. When he looked up, he found Rozemyne staring at him, clutching both shumils to her chest as her mouth hung open and her face and neck glowed crimson.</p><p>“Forget I said that.”</p><p>“I don’t think I could if I tried,” she breathed. The look on her face and the heat in her eyes was enough to ignite Brenwarmme’s flames in his blood and call Beischmacht’s bewitching song. His fingers twitched at his sides with the need to embrace her, and his lips turned cold as they longed for her warmth. Her eyes were a magic circle for summoning winter, her body the incantation, and he longed to study every syllable.</p><p>“Ferdinand, I…”</p><p>“Go,” he said, holding up a hand to stop her from continuing. He was certain that whatever she was about to say would break his resolve. <em>She’s still in her summer!</em> he chided himself. <em>No matter how old she looks, she’s still a season away from autumn, and your starbind is yet two years away.</em></p><p>“Fine,” she said, “but I’m taking your shumil with me.”</p><p>“What? Why?” he asked, snapping his gaze back to her.</p><p>She gave him a petulant pout as she replied, “I’m going to clean her with my rinsham and sleep with her so she smells like me. You can have her back after that.”</p><p>“There is no need for such foolishness,” he said, reaching for the doll. “Give it here.”</p><p>“No!” she said as she danced back towards the teleportation circle. “If I have to suffer, then so do you!”</p><p>“Suffer?!”</p><p>“That’s right!” she said. “If I’m going to have to endure having dessert held right under my nose without having a taste, then so are you!” With that, she vanished, leaving him confused, aroused, and frustrated.</p><p>With a sigh, he went to his shelves and started pulling out the ingredients to make a charm to Verfuhremeer, finally admitting to himself that he wouldn’t survive the next two years without divine intervention.</p>

<h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
<p>The Archduke Conference promised to be a headache, and unfortunately, Ferdinand would have to endure the entire thing per the new zent’s orders. Since Rozemyne was underaged and only had to be present to sign a contract with Aub Dunkelfelger, she escaped that fate and would come the day she was needed. As Justus, Janrik, and Lasfam prepared for his departure, Ferdinand worked with Karstedt to continue training the knights. Lamprecht would be taking over for them during their absence, but for the moment, he was practicing swordplay with Rozemyne. Wilfried ran drills with the strike team, preparing for Cornelius’s departure this winter without telling anyone, Charlotte worked on spear forms with Natalie, and Melchior, who was desperate to be included, was performing basic sword swings under his head guard knight’s watchful eye.</p><p>Throughout practice, Ferdinand kept stealing glances at Rozemyne as she fought in feystone armor, her dark hair pulled back into a single tail. Her form had improved significantly over the years, especially after she woke from her second jureve and began taking training seriously. Even in combat, her lithe form was graceful as she danced out of reach of her brother’s blade. She wouldn’t be able to stand up against a trained knight, but she could hold her own against moderately strong feybeasts. The contrast against the weaker Rozemyne who had struggled to hold a chalice aloft for a short amount of time was so stark as to completely sever the two in Ferdinand’s mind. He’d known it for a while, but she truly was a completely different person.</p><p>“Something distracting you?” Karstedt asked, his brow raised. “Or should I say someone?”</p><p>With a grunt, Ferdinand turned to face the opposite direction of Rozemyne. “No,” he said. “I am merely observing all activity on the field.”</p><p>“Right,” he replied, a grin in his voice. “So this is it, then. After this practice is the Archduke Conference, and then…”</p><p>Ferdinand nodded. “Then it will all be up to you.”</p><p>Sighing, Karstedt ran a hand through his thinning hair and said, “It was nice having you back. The knights will be devastated to see you leave again.”</p><p>“I doubt that,” he scoffed.</p><p>“Hmm… Rozemyne was right about you?”</p><p>“In what regard?” he asked, narrowing his eyes at his cousin.</p><p>“She said that you have no idea how important you are to others.”</p><p><em>Because I’m not,</em> he thought. Sylvester, Rozemyne, and his name sworn were exceptions. Sylvester, despite telling Rozemyne to let Ferdinand go and stop communicating with him, had been unable to follow his own advice and had enabled her to save him in the previous weave. Even in the current weave, he included Ferdinand in all important decisions and supported him when he moved to set up Aub Dunkelfelger as Zent to save Rozemyne.</p><p>As for Rozemyne herself, she refused to give up on him, despite common sense saying she should have long ago. She’d even sworn her name to him and accepted his in return.</p><p>His name sworn, of course, had to view him as important since he held their lives in his hands. There was no reason for anyone else to hold him in any special regard.</p><p>“Elvira had to lock herself in her hidden room when she learned you were leaving.”</p><p>“Because of Rozemyne.”</p><p>“Well, yes, but also because of you. She doesn’t want to see you go.”</p><p>With a snort, Ferdinand retorted, “I’m taking half her family with me. Of course she is loath to see me leave Ehrenfest.”</p><p>Karstedt sighed again and stared up at the sky as though looking for answers. “I’m beginning to wonder if you just refuse to see it or if you truly are that blind. Look, let me put it this way. Let’s say Sylvester appoints Wilfried as High Bishop.”</p><p>“A preposterous notion.”</p><p>“Let me finish. Everyone associated with the temple cheers. When he goes to the temple, all the priests swarm him with congratulations and start telling him various stories about the time they spent with him when he was a blue priest. How do the priests in this example feel about Wilfried?”</p><p>Ferdinand sighed. “They respect him and view him favorably.”</p><p>“Do you think he would be important to them?”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>Karstedt slapped a heavy hand on his shoulder and forced him to meet his eye. “You are Wilfried, and the knights are the priests, you fool.”</p><p>Ferdinand blinked at him. The examples weren’t the same. The knights had been excited when Sylvester had announced his appointment, but that didn’t mean…</p><p>He turned his gaze to the knights, all of whom were pushing themselves through grueling training. When they had surrounded him and told him stories that he’d been present for, he’d thought it nothing but an annoyance. Had they actually been expressing something akin to care in those moments? Was it their proof that they hadn’t forgotten him even when he left noble society and joined the temple?</p><p>He’d always thought their respect was for the aub’s brother, not who he was as a person. Was he mistaken?</p><p>A sense of melancholy welled up within him. If what Karstedt said was true about Ferdinand being important to people outside his circle, then this was his greatest act of cruelty. He’d revealed the truth on the eve of the Archduke Conference where he would lose it all. He would come back as the future Aub Alexandria, not the Ehrenfest Knight Commander. This would be the final day he could experience the connection his cousin professed existed, and the sun was well past its zenith.</p><p>Ferdinand sighed and shook his head. There was no point in regretting missed opportunities. Instead, he turned his focus back to training and barked orders for the knights to shift tasks, trying to convince himself he didn’t feel the pain all the while.</p><p> </p><p>The day of arrival at the Archduke Conference was a flurry of activity. Scholars flitted about the common room discussing schedules and negotiations while attendants fretted about sweets and whom their charges would be taking tea with. Justus and Janrik were among them, and Eckhart stood with the listless knights who’d gathered in the common room with nothing to do until the conference started. The moment Ferdinand entered the room, however, they all snapped to attention.</p><p>Sighing, he fought the urge to tap his temple as he looked at them. This would be his final duty as Knight Commander of Ehrenfest. He desperately wished Karstedt had kept his mouth shut during training because now he could see the glimmer of respect in most of the knights’ eyes. He needed to repay them for the undeserved kindness they’d shown him these last few years since he would be abandoning them once again.</p><p>“Knights,” he said, “the gathering spot has been overflowing with strong feybeasts ever since Wilfried and Rozemyne replenished it, so we will hunt them as part of your training. You may gather any ingredients you find as well.”</p><p>“Pardon, Knight Commander,” one of the braver knights said, “won’t that deplete it for the students returning this winter?”</p><p>“Worry not. I shall take care of it.” It would cost some mana he’d rather put towards his plans for winter and would certainly be an annoyance, but it was a small price to pay for showing his gratitude.</p><p>The air filled with the knights’ excited murmurs as they determined who would stay with the Archduke and First Wife. With that settled, Ferdinand led them to the gathering spot.</p><p>Just as Justus had reported, it was filled with powerful feybeasts and plenty of rare ingredients, neither of which Ferdinand could pass up. He and Eckhart worked together to take down several of the more dangerous beasts before they began gathering ingredients from the abundant flora. Looking around the grounds, Ferdinand couldn’t fight the thrill that rose in him. If Rozemyne’s mana had brought this change about, he could only imagine what it would do for his experiments on feyplants. He would need to find a way to have her replenish the grounds for the feybeasts he would study as well to see what effect it had on them.</p><p>Most of the knights went back to the dorms for lunch and returned to the gathering spot with Sylvester’s and Florencia’s guards swapping out. Ferdinand ate field rations instead and continued gathering. If he was going to have to replenish the land, then he was going to get everything he could out of it first.</p><p>As dinner drew near, he decided to wrap things up. Most of the strong feybeasts and the best materials had been taken, so they didn’t have much else to gain by staying, and he wanted to bathe before he ate.</p><p>“You may return to the dormitory now,” Ferdinand announced as he descended towards the center.</p><p>“C-Can we stay to watch?”</p><p>Ferdinand turned to see who had asked, but all of their faces were lit with so much hope that he sighed and gave in. “Fine, but remain silent.”</p><p>Why that sent them into a round of cheering was beyond him.</p><p>Once he landed, he dismissed his highbeast, summoned his schtappe, and transformed it into Flutrane’s staff. A low murmur rippled through the crowd watching him, which he found vexing as he had just told them to remain silent.</p><p>It wasn’t worth his time to address, however, so he chose to ignore it and planted the staff in the ground, chanting the prayer that would restore the land. As the magic circle rose, he traced each beautiful swoop with his eyes. He already knew the circle thanks to Hartmut, but it was a breathtaking sight to behold when activated. As it passed overhead, he had to drink a potion from his belt. Moments later, the circle vanished, and he glanced around at the replenished flora with satisfaction. The Ehrenfest students wouldn’t suffer this winter.</p><p>“That was amazing!”</p><p>“Wow, he really did it by himself!”</p><p>“Our knight commander is the best! There’s not another one in all of Yurgenschmidt that could pull that off!”</p><p>“Eh, what about Dunkelfelger? With all the people they have, their knight commander is bound to have a ton of mana.”</p><p>“Please, do you know how many times our knight commander has wiped the floor with Dunkelfelger during ditter? He’s even beaten the aub himself!”</p><p>Ferdinand sighed and rubbed at the headache that was starting to bloom at his temple. “That’s enough. Go back to the dormitory.”</p><p>“Yes, Knight Commander!”</p><p>He had a few blessed minutes of quiet during his bath, but the dining hall was full of chatter. When he finally made it to his bedroom, he was exhausted. Once Janrik dressed him, Justus held out the dark blue shumil to him with a soft smile. “She should be ready now.”</p><p>Ferdinand grunted as he took the doll and got into bed, waiting for both his attendants to leave before he pressed the yellow feystone on the doll’s forehead.</p><p>A few moments later, it flashed. <em>Good evening, Ferdinand,</em> Rozemyne called. <em>How was your first day at the conference?</em></p><p>He didn’t fight the smile hearing her voice brought to his lips. “The conference hasn’t started yet. Tomorrow will be the first day.”</p><p>
<em>Oh? What did you do today, then?</em>
</p><p>“I took the knights out to the gathering spot.”</p><p><em>What?!</em> she gasped. <em>What’re the students going to do this winter?</em></p><p>He chuckled. “Worry not. I replenished it.”</p><p>
<em>Aw, I wish I could have seen it.</em>
</p><p>“You’ve seen me perform religious rituals before,” he sighed.</p><p>
<em>Not that one. Still, I’m surprised you did it alone. Knowing you, I would have thought you’d make all the knights participate.</em>
</p><p>“This was more efficient.”</p><p>
<em>Uh huh.</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand closed his eyes and tightened his grip around the shumil. Even when she didn’t see his face, she could tell when he was hiding something. She’d always been observant of him, able to tell from the most minute of changes in his expression what he was feeling. It could be annoying at times like this when he didn’t want to speak his true thoughts.</p><p>He decided to change subjects. “What did you do today, Rozemyne?”</p><p><em>Mostly embroidery,</em> she sighed.</p><p>“Yes, you’ll need to finish the shumils’ outfits before winter,” he said. “I’ll excuse you from studying while I’m away so you can focus on that.”</p><p>The shumil remained silent.</p><p>“Rozemyne?”</p><p>
<em>Oh, sorry. I was just, um, surprised. Thank you. I’ll work really hard on the embroidery.</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand raised a brow, recognizing that tone. “Rozemyne, what did you do?”</p><p>
<em>What do you mean?</em>
</p><p>“You’ve been up to something that you don’t want me to know about, haven’t you? What is it?”</p><p>
<em>I haven’t been up to anything! I told you already - I spent the day embroidering. Rather than throw accusations, you should be praising me for my dedication. Do you know how much reading time I had to give up? All of it. Literally all of it. After I’ve made such unreasonable sacrifices, I think it’s terrible that you show such distrust in me when you should be praising my efforts. Come on! Praise me! Praise me!</em>
</p><p>He chuckled at her obvious attempt to distract him but decided to let her have her way. He would discover what she was hiding soon enough. “Did I not make you a recording device so that you could be praised whenever you wanted?” he teased.</p><p><em>That’s not the same, and you know it!</em> He could hear her pout. <em>Come on, you shouldn’t make your fiancée beg.</em></p><p>“Hm. Fine,” he said, bringing the shumil down so its forehead rested against his own as he closed his eyes and took in the scent of her rinsham. “You worked hard today, Rozemyne. Well done.”</p><p>
<em>O-oh…</em>
</p><p>Why did she sound so startled? “Was that not what you wanted?” he asked.</p><p>
<em>It was…more than I wanted, but in a good way. Just, um, if you use that deep tone to praise me, make sure no one else can hear you. Ehehehe…</em>
</p><p>He lifted the shumil and raised a questioning brow at it before he recalled the look she’d given him that day in the library when he’d sent out those ordonnanzes using the same tone he did when he gave orders as knight commander. He thought she would have gotten used to it by now since she spent so much time at the training grounds, but perhaps combining it with praise was too stimulating for her.</p><p>He filed that away for later use.</p><p>“Noted,” he said. “You, however, should work to keep your mind free from frost while you’re still in summer.”</p><p><em>Easier said than done when your fiancé’s face and voice were made to summon winter,</em> Rozemyne muttered, petulant and resentful.</p><p>“Rozemyne!” Ferdinand barked.</p><p>
<em>What? Oh! OH NO! IT WAS STILL ON?! Nooooo! Oh, gods! Turn off! Turn off! Turn o—</em>
</p><p>The light in the feystone winked out, letting him know the connection was severed. He pressed the shumil into his face and groaned. Every heated glance she’d thrown his way flashed through his mind, and he pulled the doll away from his face, dropping it on the other side of the bed where he couldn’t smell its intoxicating scent. This girl would send him up the towering staircase long before their starbind. With a sigh, he grasped the charm hanging from his wrist and started offering prayers to Verfuhremeer.</p><p>It was just as he was falling asleep that he realized he never asked about progress on their preparations to move.</p><p> </p><p>The next morning was the Starbind Ceremony, which Sylvester and Florencia had to attend. The Sovereign High Bishop conducted it, which gave Ferdinand a small measure of relief. He had hoped Aub Dunkelfelger wouldn’t decide to start the conference off by announcing himself High Bishop. He would be by the time Ferdinand bound his stars, and he hoped the man would use the divine instruments. Ferdinand had heard about the ceremony the other Rozemyne had performed, and he dearly wanted to see it with his own eyes, especially if his gremlin wouldn’t be in the center of it.</p><p>After the ceremony, the archduke and his wife returned, their faces pale. Ferdinand immediately had Janrik prepare a room and erected a sound-blocking barrier. “Everyone noticed Sigiswald’s absence,” Sylvester said. “Nothing official’s been said yet, so there’s a ton of speculation going around.”</p><p>“Since his wife was also not present, I didn’t hear anyone mention the towering heights,” Florencia said, “so I think it’s safe to assume no one will cause too much of a fuss.”</p><p>“What of Aub Dunkelfelger?”</p><p>Sylvester shrugged. “Same as ever. His son was with him. I’d be willing to bet he’s dyed the foundation already, and the aub is working to fill the country’s.”</p><p>“So things are more or less progressing as they normally would.”</p><p>“Yeah, I’m guessing they’re going to make the big announcement towards the end.”</p><p>“When no one has time to renegotiate or forge new connections.”</p><p>“Or time to plot revenge while they are in the same location as the future zent,” Florencia added.</p><p>“If I were him,” Sylvester said, “I’d make all the announcements right before I told everyone about the foundation being in the temple. Then, they’d all be in a rush to get back to protect the true path.”</p><p>While that could work to some degree, it would build up more resentment than anything since no one would have time to meet with other duchies to work around the changes, himself included. Granted, as a neutral duchy that wouldn’t have its aub until winter, he had very little to do in that regard.</p><p>After everyone ate lunch, Sylvester and Florencia had half a bell before they needed to go to their first meetings. He was going to speak with Drewanchel about their printing industry and new sweetener from tree sap, and she was meeting with Lady Sieglinde, likely to watch ditter since she wouldn’t say what topics they planned to discuss.</p><p>No one knew Ferdinand was present yet except Dunkelfelger, so he and Justus used the amulet of Verbergen to go down to Hirschur’s lab where the shumil she’d made him help create answered the door. His old professor was so shocked to see him that she nearly lost control of her brew. Fortunately, she came back to her senses in time to save it.</p><p>While he waited, he glanced around the room, noticing the layer of dust covering nearly every surface, the haphazard stacks of boards, papers, scrolls, and books on every flat surface including the floor, and bits of remains from meals that had taken place at least three days before.</p><p>Once she finished her brew, Hirschur walked over and asked, “And what brings you to the Archduke Conference?”</p><p>“The consequences of my actions,” he said. “What were you working on?”</p><p>Her eyes glittered as she replied, “An idea I got from your fiancée, actually. Take a look.” She handed him a length of string that didn’t behave quite right. It didn’t lay as flat as he would have expected, and it felt strange to the touch, almost as though it had adhesive on its surface without actually sticking to him. When he pulled on it, it stretched much like the gumka plant paper from Drewanchel. He raised a questioning brow at her, and she said, “It’s a stretchy mana chain in essence, though without any metal. Rozemyne claims it would have many uses, like in jewelry, clothing, upholstery, and so forth.”</p><p>Ferdinand studied the strange mana chain further, wondering what insanity his out-of-standard gremlin was about to visit upon Yurgenschmidt. He could see it being useful for creating items that could stretch to multiple sizes, but most charms already resized themselves. Perhaps she planned to use it in form-fitting clothing like the dress she made for her guard knight so it would be more forgiving in slight changes in size or shape over time.</p><p>Overall, he saw no personal use for it, so he handed it back over. “Interesting,” he said. “On another note, I have gathered some rare materials, including the fruit of a feyplant that is almost entirely composed of the life element.”</p><p>“Oh? Let’s see it then.”</p><p>Justus set out the ingredients, and Ferdinand handed her the parue.</p><p>“Oh, this is quite interesting. With this much life element, it would make an excellent winter ingredient. Have you turned one into a feystone?”</p><p>“Yes, and the result is what you would expect of a fruit that pure and that size. I’d say it would be a fair substitution for a Lord of Winter’s feystone in brews.”</p><p>She widened her eyes at that and then went to one of her stacks of documents, spilling a third of them across the floor before she found what she was looking for. “This magic circle is built on purely hypothetical principles, but if we could use a feystone from this fruit as the anchor ingredient…”</p><p>“Hm, yes, but it would be more efficient if we changed this portion of the circle. If you adjust it like so, it will balance better with the life element.”</p><p>Thus began their conversation that lasted until Justus alerted him that the Goddess of Light had started to grace the skies. He took his leave and returned to the Ehrenfest dorms where he went to his room to take a nap. As he settled into the bed, a flash caught his eye, and he glanced over to find the shumil laying on its side, glaring at him.</p><p>Grimacing, he picked up the doll and fed it some mana. “Good morning, Rozemyne.”</p><p><em>Good morning, Ferdinand. I tried to call you last night, but you didn’t answer.</em> She sounded less accusatory and more disappointed. He would have preferred the opposite as he would have felt less guilty.</p><p>“I went to see Hirschur in the afternoon.”</p><p>
<em>And so you pulled an all-nighter. Okay, then let me give you a brief update. Preparations are coming along. Fran and Fritz have decided to come to the new temple, Zahm would like you to purchase him, and I’ll be purchasing my female attendants, one of which will become another chef who will train those in the temple how to cook like they do here. The instructors for the temple school are planning to come to the new temple as well and have started training their replacements who will enter Charlotte’s then Melchior’s service.</em>
</p><p>Ferdinand sighed. “It seems I selected an inopportune time to discuss research.”</p><p>
<em>No, you didn’t miss anything that couldn’t wait until you returned, and you don’t get to see your mentor often. You probably won’t be here during the summer when she tends to visit, and you’ll be aub for the next interduchy tournament, so I’m glad you got this opportunity. Oh, I have to go. Lieseleta’s going to be here any minute to wake me. Bye, Ferdinand!</em>
</p><p>He said his farewells and deactivated the feystone, watching its light blink out. No longer being connected to her or hearing her voice left him with an odd sense of loneliness as he lay in his bed, shut off from everyone else by the thick curtains that surrounded him. He was fine when he first got into bed, but after their conversation, it was as though he’d reached out to feel her warmth only to find a cold spot where she should have been.</p><p>He wondered once they bound their stars if she would want to share a bed like her downtown family did. What would it be like to have her presence next to him when he fell asleep and woke up in the morning, to hear her soft breathing, feel her warmth, see her sleeping face? He wasn’t sure he would be able to sleep with someone else lying beside him, but he found the idea more appealing than he would have thought.</p><p>He fell asleep, the shumil held against his chest.</p><p> </p><p>The following day was filled with meetings, meals, and tea parties for Sylvester and Florencia, meaning Ferdinand would take lunch in his room to avoid announcing his presence yet. They wanted to hold off for as long as they could so that he didn’t get cornered before he had the power to speak with them on more equal footing.</p><p>That didn’t mean Ferdinand would forgo intelligence gathering. He sent Justus under the shroud of Verbergen to learn everything he could.</p><p>First was news he’d expected - Lucius was recognized as Aub Ahrensbach. There was some speculation that he was a relative of Ferdinand’s on his unknown mother’s side amongst the middle- and lower-ranking duchies and those with aubs who had been appointed after the civil war, but everyone else was mute on the subject. It seemed they assumed Lucius’s true origins were rooted in Adalgisa.</p><p>Ferdinand hated that so many people knew of the past he’d sooner forget.</p><p>Lucius already had offers of light and water goddesses, but Aub Dunkelfelger had put forward a niece as a candidate who was supposedly within range, so the selection of first wife was a foregone conclusion. He would likely find a Lanzenavian woman to be his second wife in the future.</p><p>Drewanchel and Dunkelfelger had brought books to market to the other duchies, and copies had been provided to Sylvester per the contract that they would soon have to amend. Drewanchel and the Sovereignty were marketing various types of paper they’d created, and Sylvester had already made arrangements to purchase some. They tried to have him agree to give them the same trade slots, if not more, as the year before, but he refused to discuss it since the Soveriegnty would soon no longer exist.</p><p>Speculation abounded on Sigiswald and his wife’s absence. Some were beginning to eye Anastasius with suspicion. If they waited much longer to announce Sigiswald’s death, it seemed many would assume his brother had assassinated him.</p><p>The second prince had managed to get engaged to Eglantine, so he would be aub instead of Wilfried. It wasn’t ideal to have her as the first wife of a duchy who was taking part of the lands Klassenberg managed, but it was a far sight better than giving it to that pure-hearted boy.</p><p>Overall, it seemed things were panning out about as Ferdinand expected.</p><p>Until he received an invitation from Aub Dunkelfelger for him and Rozemyne for the following morning.</p>

<p>When Rozemyne arrived at the dormitory and saw Ferdinand waiting for her, she burst into a radiant smile. He coughed, and she immediately schooled her features, but his retainers had already seen her shameless display. Even after years of Elvira’s training, she still lost control of herself at times.</p><p>Would he just have to accept that he would have to share these expressions that should have been reserved for him alone with their retainers?</p><p>She walked over to him and offered him proper greetings before she took his hand and let him escort her to the common room. Sylvester had warned everyone that she would be coming under order of the Zent, but they still regarded her with surprise.</p><p>They went to a meeting room where they had tea as they waited for the appointed time. Rather than set up a barrier, Ferdinand activated his ear cuff. “Are you prepared?” he asked.</p><p>“Of course,” she replied. “It helps that we already negotiated the basic terms of the contract, so I imagine the meeting will be rather short.”</p><p>Furrowing his brow, Ferdinand said, “I do not share your optimism. Sylvester has a gut feeling that things will escalate beyond our expectations.”</p><p>Her face paled at that. After a moment, she set down her teacup and folded her hands in her lap, a merchant’s smile on her face. “Then for each new demand, we should negotiate for a boon of equal value. We will already be receiving books, rare materials, feybeasts, and authors. What else do you feel we need for our duchy?”</p><p>He gave her a smirk, glad his future wife could be just as cold, calculating, and cutthroat as he was in her negotiations. “Priests. The temple would have been emptied after the Civil War.”</p><p>“Right, some would have been moved to Dunkelfelger and others to Ahrensbach. However, the Sovereignty took the majority of them. The new zent will need support in the temple, but since they’ll be filling the true foundation and conducting rituals here with aubs and students, I think they could afford to send some priests to us and Prince Anastasius. If we offer to offset the loss by taking on some of their orphans, too, that will aid us in establishing the Alexandrian branch of the Rozemyne Workshop.”</p><p>“So you make it sound like a concession when it’s actually another boon,” he said, feeling his evil grin stretch across his face. Her cheeks flushed pink, and her eyes became somewhat glassy as her breath hitched.</p><p>He quickly wiped the smile off his face, adding it to the ever growing list of things he had to store away until after their starbind. Soon, he wouldn’t even be able to be in the same room with her at this rate.</p><p>Fortunately, it seemed none of their retainers caught the reaction. Perhaps it had been more minor than he’d thought.</p><p>“They probably didn’t leave the divine instruments there, either, and I want a new bible with a new key,” she said after clearing her throat. “It would take quite a bit of mana, but the Zent would be the one to make them. He’d need to do it for the prince as well, so it’s not really something to bargain for but a basic requirement.</p><p>“If he doesn’t bring it up, though, we need to allow priests and shrine maidens to marry, especially if archduke candidates are going to be required to hold the position of High Bishop.”</p><p>Ferdinand nodded. “Perhaps that will help reduce the number of flowers sought in the temple.”</p><p>She gave a slight shrug. “Maybe, maybe not. Even in situations where people marry for love, affairs still happen, and for generations the easiest place to facilitate such encounters has been the temple. No matter what policies are passed, that practice will not die overnight.” She glanced at Justus and then covered her mouth. “Even in parts of my old world where prostitution was banned, it still happened. The only difference was that it wasn’t regulated in the places it was illegal, and there were more child victims as well as women who were taken advantage of.”</p><p>“What do you suggest, then?” he asked. “Surely you’re not going to tell the zent to set up such a den of depravity.”</p><p>She sighed and looked towards the ceiling, pressing a finger into her cheek. “We basically put that system in place at the Ehrenfest temple, no? I only allowed those willing to serve in that capacity to be taken by blue robes. Rather than have any of us directly involved, perhaps we should speak to merchants about it? I imagine the flowers would mostly be commoners or low-manaed individuals to begin with. We should probably look at developing [#€*^¥&amp;@], though.”</p><p>“What was that?”</p><p>“Oh,” she said. “Um, something that prevents Entrinduge from visiting? Basically, we need a way to prevent any more cases like Lily’s from happening, and it would need to be cheap and easy to access for commoners. That rules out potions and probably most amulets. Although that might be a good market to tap into for nobles.”</p><p>Ferdinand felt his ears warm at the topic, but he maintained his composure. He covered his mouth as he asked, “What did you do in your old world?”</p><p>“Medicine,” she replied, holding her sleeve over the lower half of her face. “That won’t be an option here, I’m afraid. We also had…hmmm… How to describe it? Ah, sheaths made of something like gumka sap that fit over a sword so that it would catch…you know.”</p><p>Now his ears were on fire, and his pulse spiked. How could she talk so blatantly about winter deeds as a woman who’d never experienced them herself with her fiancé? He was ready to end this conversation, but he knew it was necessary, and he would have to be the one to propose it to Aub Dunkelfelger. There was no way he would let his fiancée discuss such matters with another man. “That might be difficult to produce at scale since Drewanchel controls most of the gumka in Yurgenschmidt, which would add shipping costs. Was there anything else?”</p><p>“Um, a long time ago, there was an herb people used, but they harvested it to extinction. I don’t remember what it was called, but it probably wouldn’t exist in the same form here even if there were an equivalent. To be honest, I never had to worry about this, so my knowledge is a bit limited. Let me try to approach this from a Yurgenschmidt perspective. Entrinduge is under Flutrane, and then there’s the God of Life… Could we use ingredients that would counteract water and life to prevent Geduldh’s burden?”</p><p>“Perhaps,” Ferdinand said, “but it would likely still have to be brewed, and we’d need to test it somehow.”</p><p>“Right,” she muttered. “They would use new substances on animals in my old world, but they knew which parts of which animals worked the most similar to humans. Mice were often used to test respiratory medicines, for instance.”</p><p>“We can test on feybeasts as well,” he said, “but the results are not always accurate.”</p><p>“Maybe there are teas that have the properties we’re looking for?” she asked. “Perhaps if someone were to drink it on a regular basis, it would significantly reduce the chances of accepting Geduldh’s burden. Commoners might know since they have to be careful of the number of mouths they have to feed. Maybe I could ask Corinna or Tuuli?”</p><p>“Perhaps,” Ferdinand said, thinking of what ingredients would counteract Life and Water. Perhaps he could focus on strong Darkness attributes to simply absorb the mana, but that would do nothing for commoners. It would likely have to be applied directly rather than consumed, regardless.</p><p>It was a shame he hadn’t taken all of the doctor courses at the Academy, but he doubted such intricacies were covered. So far the most viable solution was the sheath she’d mentioned. “Hirschur managed to brew gumka into a stretchy thread-like mana chain. Perhaps it’s possible to manufacture the sheaths from it.”</p><p>“Probably,” she agreed, “but I’m not sure how they were made. I know they supposedly needed to be thin as well since it reduced the, um, sensation for the man. They used to use sheaths made of animal intestines, but they weren’t very effective because there were tiny holes in them that you couldn’t see, but snow could still pass through.”</p><p>Ferdinand groaned and rested his forehead on his hand. That was his limit. He didn’t want to hear her mention swords, sheaths, or snow again until they returned to Alexandria after their starbinding. “Set up a meeting between me and whichever of your male downtown associates you would trust to handle this. I’ll handle things from there. Just, please, let’s stop talking about this.” This was an issue he could handle at a duchy level to begin with. Mentioning it to the Zent would be more than enough. He didn’t need to bargain over it.</p><p>“My apologies,” she muttered. “I wonder who, though? Benno’s a forever bachelor. Probably the closest skill to this would be clothing manufacturing, and Gilberta is already experimenting with gumka in clothing… In that case, I’ll contact Otto when we return.”</p><p>“Fine, let’s move on.”</p><p>“But what about the flower offerings?”</p><p>“I’ll discuss it with the new Zent in a private meeting,” he said. “You can’t expect us to discuss such a topic with an unmarried woman present.”</p><p>“Fine,” she said. “What else do we need to ask for?”</p><p>They spent the rest of the morning discussing several other potential concessions from the Zent before a squad of Dunkelfelger knights came to escort them to their aub to have lunch. The purpose of their presence was to hide Rozemyne from sight the best they could and to show Ferdinand hadn’t chosen to ignore the rules to bring his underaged fiancée to the conference.</p><p>“Ferdinand! Rozemyne! Welcome!” Aub Dunkelfelger greeted them with his usual wide smile, but he lacked his normal energy. Lady Sieglinde sitting next to him seemed a bit worn out as well. “We have much to discuss and a ditter contract to sign! But first, we shall eat! My chefs have been toiling tirelessly to perfect the recipes in your books. We shall see if they meet with your approval.”</p><p>After the poison checks, Ferdinand took a bite of the first offering, caprese salad, and analyzed the flavor and texture. “This is certainly comparable to what is available in Ehrenfest,” he said. It was somewhat lacking compared to the restaurant and what Rozemyne’s chefs could produce, but such heights were likely far beyond most mortals’ reach. Cuoccocalora himself moved through those chefs’ hands.</p><p>“It is quite lovely,” Rozemyne agreed. “Just a touch more on the herbs would enhance the flavor further.”</p><p>The scholar behind the aub took note of her comment. Ferdinand twitched a brow at her, indicating his surprise that she had freely given away that tip. Her responding smile said she would collect payment before the meeting was through. She’d evidently decided to use the innocuous tip to make the aub more amenable to their requests.</p><p>“So tell us, how does Ehrenfest fair after the end of winter?”</p><p>Rozemyne froze momentarily, surprised he had chosen to obfuscate his question among his own people. Did he feel some in the room were untrustworthy, or had he become more cautious after accepting his new role?</p><p>“We celebrated the coming of spring with minimal issue,” Ferdinand replied.</p><p>“Glad to hear it!”</p><p>Lady Sieglinde asked, “Have you heard the news about Prince Anastasius?”</p><p>“My apologies,” Rozemyne said. “I’ve heard nothing from the conference.”</p><p>The conversation continued to flow in that fashion with the Dunkelfelger couple sharing news Justus had already reported. When dessert was served, the aub signaled his attendant, who erected a sound-blocking barrier.</p><p>“Now, let us discuss matters of consequence,” the aub said. “First, my son finished dyeing the foundation just after the feast celebrating spring, and two evenings ago, I claimed the country’s foundation.”</p><p>“Oh, that was fast!” Rozemyne gasped, nearly drawing a chuckle from Ferdinand.</p><p>He nodded. “As you know, redrawing the lines will change everything, from how conversations are carried out to what business deals are made. I cannot delay the announcement any longer. As you know, everyone will come together for the meeting where rankings are revealed tomorrow afternoon. That is when we will announce it.”</p><p>Ferdinand’s heart rate spiked, but he maintained his composure. Such vast change carried out so suddenly would cause an uproar the likes of which he’d never seen, and the thought of being one of the people in the center of it made his skin crawl. He was a man made to wear the black cape, not the golden crown.</p><p>“Now, you have a decision to make,” Zent Werdekraf said, holding Ferdinand’s gaze. “Your duchy will be the Wisdom of the Zent. I will reveal that the new leaders of the duchy led me to my Wisdom. I am aware that Rozemyne already revealed to over a hundred witnesses from multiple duchies that she holds the Book of Mestionora while you have kept yours hidden away. I know the Lord of Evil does not move without purpose. Therefore, I am giving you the choice: will you be the incarnation of Mestionora, or will Rozemyne?”</p><p>Ferdinand froze, his lungs refusing to work for several moments. <em>Why are the gods so intent on keeping certain patterns in the weave?</em> he thought bitterly. The logical answer to the Zent’s question was Rozemyne, but he had no desire to have her play the role that had cost the other one her life. The gods could not descend on her so long as she wore the charm he gave her, but to even have her pretend at being an incarnation made his blood run cold.</p><p>The gods did not care about them as individuals, so why did they repeat so many patterns for Rozemyne?</p><p>A slight weight fell on his knee, and he glanced down to see Rozemyne had placed her hand there. It was utterly shameless and highly inappropriate, but he made no move to brush her away. That hand was his anchor, and if he cut it loose, he would be tossed about by the whims of the storm.</p><p>He turned to her and found the strength that had fled him the moment he’d heard the words, “incarnation of Mestionora.” From her expression radiated her conviction, from her eyes her desire to take the burden he found too heavy to bear.</p><p>The decision he made would change the shape of their relationship. Either he would give her the trust she’d begged of him, or she would realize that he would never let her in.</p><p>The answer was as simple as the question that had put him in this dilemma, and yet it was the hardest choice he’d ever faced.</p><p>Could he finally let go of the previous Rozemyne and forgive himself for the mistakes that led to her melting away in his arms?</p><p>Or would he continue to carry the weight of her death, letting it drag the present Rozemyne down with him?</p><p>Choosing Rozemyne felt like he was abandoning her again, turning his back on her on that snowy day at the border between Ehrenfest and Ahrensbach.</p><p>Choosing himself felt like he was fulfilling an obligation to her, that he was protecting her.</p><p>He knew it was a lie. Keeping her in the cage his fear and distrust had built for her wasn’t protection. It was abuse.</p><p>He knew it, but he didn’t believe it.</p><p>Yet.</p><p>Rozemyne seemed to recognize the moment he’d made his decision, and she gave him that warm, heart-breaking smile that had nearly broken him when he put her in her jureve at the beginning of the second weave. It was a smile that conveyed the trust she had in him that he did not deserve.</p><p>Yet.</p><p>Ferdinand swallowed and reached down to grasp her hand, propriety be damned, for he didn’t have the strength to take this step alone.</p><p>He closed his eyes for a moment as he took in a deep breath before he turned to the Zent.</p><p>“Rozemyne will be your incarnation of Mestionora.”</p>

<p>Zent Werdekraf nodded. “Excellent! Most excellent! Rozemyne looks like the goddess, and she can wield all the sacred instruments just like her. Not to mention she brought printing into the world to spread knowledge like the glorious history of Dunkelfelger throughout the country. She is the perfect candidate to become the incarnation. This will undoubtedly set your duchy up for success.”</p><p>Rozemyne blushed and placed an embarrassed hand on her cheek at the brazen compliments. Ferdinand frowned, but everything he’d said was true.</p><p>“You should wear two hairpins tomorrow to evoke the image of the goddess even more,” Queen Sieglinde said.</p><p>Her eyes widened in panic. “Oh, I don’t have anything suitable to wear! If I were in my sixth year, I might have a whirling costume, but…”</p><p>Sighing, Ferdinand said, “Speak with your mothers and retainers. Between all of you, I’m sure you’ll find a solution.”</p><p>“Talking does not weave cloth overnight, Ferdinand,” she said, her eyes sharp.</p><p>Queen Sieglinde held a troubled hand on her cheek. “My, this is a problem. I shall send word to Dunkelfelger as well and coordinate with Lady Florencia.”</p><p>“I thank you ever so much for the consideration,” Rozemyne said, her expression full of genuine gratitude.</p><p>“I will leave this matter in your capable hands, Sieglinde,” Zent Werdekraf said. “Now, as the incarnation of Mestionora, you will be the one to place the God of Darkness’s cape on my shoulders and the Goddess of Light’s crown on my head. You can produce them with your schtappe, correct?”</p><p>Rozemyne blinked at him as Ferdinand glared. “Yes,” she said. “But…”</p><p>He waved her off. “The previous zent will be the one to do this task for the next, but we have no true zent preceding me. Therefore, we will call back to the origins of this country when the gods bestowed their Wisdom to the first zent, making him king of their garden.”</p><p>She sighed and asked, “Would that not make me appear above you?”</p><p>“It would further prove you deserve your role as the Wisdom of the Zent and keeper of knowledge. Your duchy will be one of the three authorized to move against the Zent should it become necessary. This needs to be established as soon as possible.”</p><p>Rozemyne’s lips pulled into a tight line, but she acquiesced.</p><p>“I also plan to announce the fact that all archdukes used to have their Wisdom and how future generations can hope to obtain it. You understand what this means if you continue to hide the fact that you have yours, yes, Ferdinand?”</p><p>His eyes widened, and he looked to Rozemyne who shrugged as if to say, <em>Does it matter? We’ll both be doing the work either way.</em> “After being named the incarnation of a goddess, what’s being Aub?” she whispered.</p><p>“You would make her an underaged aub?” Ferdinand asked.</p><p>“No, but you would be relay aub until she came of age.”</p><p>Rubbing his forehead, Ferdinand wondered just how many patterns the gods were determined to repeat. Erwaermen had asked him to keep the weave as intact as possible, but it seemed the gods were also taking matters into their own hands. “Very well,” Ferdinand agreed.</p><p>“Oh?” Queen Sieglinde asked. “I expected more of a fight from you.”</p><p>“It’s the logical action to take,” he said.</p><p>Nodding to himself, Zent Werdekraf said, “Excellent! Now, have you selected a name for your duchy?”</p><p>“Alexandria,” Ferdinand and Rozemyne replied at the same time, causing the royal couple to smile.</p><p>“A fine name. A fine name, indeed! Now, as for the ditter contact—“</p><p>“Zent Werdekraf,” Rozemyne said, that delightfully predatory grin on her face, “there are a few other things we should discuss first.” He raised a brow at her, and she continued, “For one, you understand, of course, the position you’re putting me in as the incarnation of a goddess. I will suffer the scrutiny of the entire country. My every action, every word, every breath will be weighed and measured against the ideals of a goddess, and I will be found wanting as no one can reach the true highest heights where she dwells. While the comparison will prove beneficial initially, it will become a weight that may drag down our duchy, especially once I become Aub at such a young age.”</p><p>The Zent frowned and crossed his arms. “I will not change my mind on this.”</p><p>“Then perhaps you can offset the losses we will suffer in the future. I think it is only fair we have lower taxes for ten years since much of the land we will inherit is some of the most mana-deprived in the country, and it will take time to ensure our people are no longer starving. As we will be your Wisdom, subsidizing the industries we bring to Alexandria so that we might fulfill the purpose you have given us would be the bare minimum of what we would need to make up for our future losses.”</p><p>Queen Sieglinde narrowed her eyes. “You will also be gaining part of the Sovereignty which benefited from the previous royal family’s mana.”</p><p>“And the territories they managed that were also at least partially neglected due to not having an accessible foundation,” Rozemyne countered. “We are gaining more abandoned territory than maintained, and we will only have ostensibly three suppliers for vast swathes of land.”</p><p>Zent Weredekraf hummed to himself as he held his chin. “We will already be paying for the books that will be distributed to the country.”</p><p>“Yes, at a discounted rate that will see us gain little to no profit.”</p><p>“Then we will subsidize half of the startup costs for your industries until you graduate from the Royal Academy.”</p><p>“And the taxes?”</p><p>Queen Sieglinde sighed. “You will pay a reduced rate of 50% for the first year, 60% for the second, 75% for the third, 85% for the fourth, and 100% for the fifth.”</p><p>Rozemyne nodded and said, “Of course, none of this will matter if we have no one to perform Spring Prayer or collect harvests and taxes during the Harvest Festival. As we will be starting a new temple, we request blue priests and shrine maidens from the losing duchy’s territories and a number from the Sovereignty to populate it.”</p><p>“That would mean taking priests and shrine maidens from Dunkelfelger and Ahrensbach, the latter of which is facing its own struggles.”</p><p>She sighed and placed a hand on her cheek, her eyes cast down. “I understand, but we desperately need priests in the temple. To reduce Ahrensbach’s burden, we can take as many of their orphans and gray robes as they wish to send.”</p><p>The Zent burst into laughter. “And so you will have your workshop while letting me give Ahrensbach and the Sovereign temple a concession. The Dunkelfelger temple manages well with the gray priests now that your reforms have been implemented, and many work in the Rozemyne Workshop there, so they will likely not be sending any grays to you. You understand, of course, that you may be receiving the worst of the blue robes.”</p><p>Ferdinand thought back to his days in the temple, dealing with the likes of Bezewanst and Egmont. It would be more efficient to eliminate such drains on temple finances than to keep them around for their meager mana. Even the income they brought with them was offset by their embezzlement and the cost of clothing and feeding their offspring in the orphanage. Of course, if Rozemyne would lend him Hartmut and Clarissa when he went to dye the foundation and once the priests arrived, most of the duchy and all in the temple would worship the ground she walked on. It would take little effort from there for Rozemyne as the High Bishop to set things to rights in the new temple.</p><p>“So long as the Sovereign High Priest is not among them, I am fine with that,” Rozemyne said, her tone leaving no room for argument. It seemed Immanuel was among the memories she’d recovered from her feystone. Truly, had she gained nothing positive from it?</p><p>Zent Werdekraf raised his eyebrow but nodded. “We can have them move to your duchy at the beginning of Winter so they can perform the Dedication Ritual, or they can go after the feast celebrating spring, which would be easier for them but leave the two of you performing the ritual by yourselves while you’re still at the Royal Academy.”</p><p>“We wouldn’t want them to move before we do,” Ferdinand agreed. “However, the Dedication Ritual is the single most important ritual for the duchy. It will be hard, but the southern portions of the country are still relatively warm at the beginning of winter, and the blizzards will not have set in yet. It will be uncomfortable but manageable for them to move then.”</p><p>“Very well.”</p><p>“We will need a new bible, key, and divine instruments, too,” Rozemyne said. “Only you have the ability to create them, no?”</p><p>“Hmm… Indeed. I will provide bibles to both Alexandria and the other new duchy. We’ll investigate where the original divine instruments from the losing territories ended up. If we cannot locate them by winter, I will create new ones.”</p><p>Shifting topic slightly, Rozemyne asked, “Since you’re assuming the role of High Bishop, will you allow all priests and shrine maidens to marry?”</p><p>“Yes,” he said. “The details will be announced tomorrow.”</p><p>She smiled at him and then slipped back into her merchant facade. “I also request your express permission to attend the next Archduke Conference as Aub Alexandria’s fiancée. He cannot do everything that must be done while attending alone.”</p><p>“Granted,” the Zent said without any hesitation.</p><p>“And–”</p><p>Queen Sieglinde’s eyes widened. “Just how much do you plan to request from us?”</p><p><em>As much as she possibly can,</em> Ferdinand thought, smirking to himself.</p><p>“This request will enable us to fulfill the purpose given to us as the Zent’s Wisdom. We need interduchy teleporters so that all duchies will be able to send us books as they are published. This will prove a more efficient method than having to move so many books through the Royal Academy during the Archduke Conference, which will incur the cost of transportation twice. If we use a teleportation circle devised by Ferdinand’s disciple, it will take miniscule amounts of mana to send printed materials to Alexandria where they will be cataloged and shelved.”</p><p>“And should someone send something dangerous through the teleporter?” the queen asked. “You cannot assume that even as a neutral duchy that you will have no enemies.”</p><p>It was Ferdinand’s turn now. Sighing, he asked to have all retainers face the wall, which the royal couple granted. Once he called forth his book and flipped to the page with the magic circle he’d recorded that he, Rozemyne, and Raimund had devised. “The wind element in this low-cost transportation circle serves two functions: to assist with the movement in teleportation and to reject malice. If one were to try to transfer anything with ill intent, the circle will not activate.”</p><p>“Hm, I want my scholar to look at this,” the Zent said as Queen Sieglinde started studying the diagram. In response, Ferdinand handed Rozemyne his Grutrissheit and sat back.</p><p>Once the scholar was brought to examine the circle, his eyes widened as they lit with excitement. “This is phenomenal!” he gasped. “Such efficiency. Not an extraneous line to be found, and the mana cost would be unbelievably low.”</p><p>“If someone wanted to use it to send poison or otherwise cause harm to the receiver, what would happen?” the queen asked.</p><p>The scholar’s brows knit together as he studied the circle. “It appears it would do nothing.”</p><p>They dismissed him, and once he turned around, Ferdinand took back his book and dismissed his schtappe.</p><p>“Hmm… I will need time to think about this,” Zent Werdekraf said. “There are many things to consider when enabling any type of interduchy teleportation. Now, is that the last request?”</p><p>Ferdinand nodded. While he and Rozemyne had other concessions they wished to obtain, they could seek further compensation during their yearly ditter games after they moved to Alexandria and saw firsthand the needs of the people. For one, they wanted children’s magic tools for the undoubtedly impoverished nobles of the managed territories. However, they didn’t know how many to ask for. As such, the tools would likely be the stake in their first ditter game once they gathered that information. Making them stakes would ensure they wouldn’t have to give anything in return, either.</p><p>“Very well! Now, the ditter contract!”</p><p>“And the contract outlining everything we discussed here,” Rozemyne said.</p><p>“<em>After</em> the ditter contract,” the Zent said, his intense glare boring into her.</p><p>At Ferdinand’s nod, Werdekraf’s head scholar produced a contract that Justus checked for poison before giving it to his master. Ferdinand read over it, confirming the terms were the same they’d verbally agreed to before passing it to Rozemyne. She scanned through it quickly and then signed first as the person with the lowest rank among them, followed by Ferdinand and Werdekraf.</p><p>Next, both couples explained the agreements they made under the sound-blocking barrier to the head scholar, and he began drawing up the contracts accordingly. After some back and forth on the wording, they signed them as well. They would have to wait until Werdekraf spoke with Lucius about the priests in Ahrensbach before they could formally make any agreements.</p><p>Once everything was settled, Ferdinand and Rozemyne were dismissed, and she set as brisk a pace as propriety would allow back to the Ehrenfest dorms. On the way, Ferdinand’s ear cuff grew warm, so he sent a pulse of mana into it.</p><p>“Ferdinand,” Rozemyne said, “thank you for relying on me.”</p><p>He knew what she was referring to, and his hand under hers stiffened. He’d made the right choice, but it still terrified him. “I will need to start relying on you more in the coming years. You will be my wife, after all.”</p><p>She turned her face to the ground to hide her expression, but he could well imagine her beautiful smile and endearing blush. “I’m glad,” she said. “I had worried you’d always see me as nothing more than a troublesome child.”</p><p>How could she think that when his obvious struggle was <em>not</em> seeing her as a girl in summer. Her heated gazes and divine beauty often threatened to engulf him in Brenwarmme’s flames, which disgusted him. That he would feel that way about someone yet to enter autumn made him far too similar to those louts in the temple who sought young flowers. Thanks to the blessings of Anwachs and Effa’s blood, she already appeared grown, but that didn’t change the fact she was still fourteen, and he should not harbor such desires for her yet.</p><p>“Of course you are more than a troublesome child,” he said. “You’re my troublesome fiancée, and in two years, you’ll be my troublesome wife.”</p><p>“Am I really that bad?”</p><p>He shot her a look.</p><p>“Fine,” she conceded, “but you’re not any better. What adult needs a child to remind them to eat?”</p><p>“What person needs to have a book physically pulled from their hands to notice the world around them?”</p><p>They gave each other saccharine smiles, but Rozemyne’s softened after a few moments, causing the tips of Ferdinand’s ears to warm. He turned to face the front and cleared his throat. She giggled at him, but she said nothing else.</p><p>When they arrived at the dorms, Rozemyne immediately asked Lieseleta to arrange a meeting with Florencia, and she asked her retainers to prepare a room so she could update them on what transpired. Elvira, who had come as her head scholar, followed after her, scribbling furiously in her diptych. She paused long enough to send Ferdinand an approving smile before going into the room with her daughter. Cornelius, in contrast, was glaring at him as Matthias pushed him along.</p><p>“Janrik,” Ferdinand said as he walked towards the stairs, “prepare a bath.” After tomorrow, his opportunities to relax would disappear, so he intended to take advantage of the bell he would have to himself until Sylvester returned from socializing.</p><p>Later that night, Ferdinand met with Sylvester alone under a sound-blocking barrier, both nursing glasses of vize.</p><p>“So it’s happening tomorrow,” Sylvester sighed.</p><p>“Yes,” Ferdinand said, “and Zent Werdekraf will name Rozemyne…” He paused and took a deep draft from his glass. “He’ll name her the incarnation of Mestionora and claim she showed him the path to his Wisdom.”</p><p>Sylvester jerked back, his eyes wide, his brows furrowed, his jaw hanging open. “He’s doing <em>what</em> to my daughter?”</p><p>He didn’t answer, unable to bring himself to say the words again. Instead, he polished off his vize and poured himself another glass.</p><p>Sylvester dropped his head in his hands and groaned. “I knew something was going to happen in that meeting, but this? Why does this keep happening to her?!” he cried. “I can’t even fathom all the ramifications that’s going to have on her.”</p><p>“She managed to extract several concessions from them in exchange,” he said.</p><p>“Well, of course she did. She’s Rozemyne.” Sylvester threw back his vize and poured himself more. “You know, I get why it’s happening, but does it always have to be my kids? Gods, adopting her was supposed to protect her and now look where she is.” He shook his head and looked forlornly at the wall, his eyes unfocused. “Well, if any good has come from all of this, it’s that she’ll be able to see her family again. I… I’ve always hated myself for…” His words caught in his throat as his nose started to turn red. “Ah, damn it, the alcohol’s getting to me.”</p><p>“It was necessary,” Ferdinand said, though he understood the sentiment, “and a far better alternative to what probably should have happened.”</p><p>“That’s cold comfort in Schneeast’s breeze,” Sylvester said. “Why didn’t she ever hate us for it? I would have in her shoes.”</p><p>That was a question Ferdinand had asked himself many times over the years. To this day, he couldn’t understand why she’d gone so far for him in the past weave, not truly. He hoped he’d done better in the second weave, but even then, he didn’t deserve everything she gave him. Sighing, he answered, “She had memories of being an adult woman. That gave her perspective a child could never hope to achieve, so she was able to understand the reason you moved as you did. Even when I read her memories, she held no malice for me and simply accepted it.” Even though he’d planned to show the previous Rozemyne his memories of her family and Lutz, he’d dreaded it, and she was the person who’d received his final will and stolen a duchy to save him.</p><p>“Even so,” Sylvester said, running a hand through his hair. Suddenly, he slammed his glass down and pointed a drifting finger at Ferdinand. “You’d better take care of her!”</p><p>He snorted. “Of course I will. Haven’t I been since she first entered the temple?”</p><p>“No, I mean it,” he said. “I know she understands you well enough to get past that abrasive exterior of yours, but that doesn’t mean your gruffness can’t hurt her. Oh, when I say, ‘Take care of her,’ I don’t mean, ‘Cover her in ice.’”</p><p>“I haven’t–”</p><p>“Ferdinand.”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p> </p><p>Ferdinand hadn’t seen Rozemyne since they parted ways the day before after the meeting with Zent Werdekraf and Queen Sieglinde. She, Florencia, and Elvira had returned to Ehrenfest during his meeting with Sylvester after one of the queen’s attendants dropped off a box for them. Other than Rozemyne’s bizarre request that Ferdinand wear his courtship necklace on the outside of his robes, that was all Justus would say on the matter without being ordered with his name stone, so Ferdinand left it at that. He’d learned how to recognize a scheme brewing between his scholar and fiancée, and they ultimately never caused him trouble.</p><p>As time for the assembly drew closer, Sylvester asked his scholar to send word to Ehrenfest as neither Florencia nor Rozemyne had returned. The response was a simple, “We shall arrive in time to attend.”</p><p>“Well, it’s still a bell before we have to go.” He shrugged.</p><p>“It was a last minute request,” Ferdinand reasoned. “They will try to use every moment available to them to prepare.”</p><p>Half a bell passed, and still they hadn’t arrived. Sylvester began to pace while Ferdinand read the same line of the report he was holding over and over, trying to focus on the words.</p><p>After another quarter bell, Sylvester exclaimed, “Alright, that’s it. Karstedt, go back to Ehrenfest and escort my wife and daughter back here.”</p><p>Karstedt bowed and left for the teleportation room. A few moments later, he returned, looking entirely like a wolfeniel who’d received a mana lashing from its master.</p><p>“Well?” Sylvester asked.</p><p>Karstedt’s eyes fell to the floor as he said, “They will be along shortly.”</p><p>“Which one got you?” he asked. “Florencia or Elvira?”</p><p>“Both.”</p><p>Ferdinand and Sylvester both winced in sympathy. Patting his guard knight on the shoulder, Sylvester said, “You did well to survive.”</p><p>“Such a situation requires a tactical retreat,” Ferdinand agreed.</p><p>Neither comment gave Karstedt the encouragement to lift his head.</p><p>Finally, the time to depart came, and Sylvester sighed. “Alright, everyone, let’s prepare to leave.”</p><p>As their retainers gathered materials and lined up by the door, the guard from the teleportation room announced the ladies’ arrival.</p><p>“Oh, thank the gods,” Sylvester breathed. He gave his wife a relieved smile as she entered the room and went to join him. “I thought I was going to have to go without you.”</p><p>“I would never shirk my duties like that,” Florencia said. “We had to wait until the last moment to come.”</p><p>“Huh? Why?”</p><p>The reason became evident when Rozemyne entered the room, surrounded by her retinue. Ferdinand’s eyes widened, and he felt his jaw drop as his brother gasped.</p><p>Rozemyne wore a light yellow dress that hugged her torso and flared into many layers of gossamer fabric that floated rather than flowed with the breeze as she moved. The neck was the typical collar style, but it was the inverse of the halter dress she’d debuted with her old guard knight. A large cutout revealed the skin between the base of her neck and the top of her bosom, only just covering her cleavage, though the suggestion of the shadow between her breasts was visible. On the exposed skin she wore the courtship necklace she often kept above her dress.</p><p>Far worse, however, were her sleeves which were made with a single layer of the same sheer fabric as the skirt, exposing all of the charms she wore on her arm, including the mana chain sleeve that protected her from the gods and the five bangles she had spread between her upper arm and wrist on her other arm.</p><p>A heavy hand gripped his shoulder, and Sylvester forcibly turned him from the bewitching, shameless, and utterly terrifying sight. His brother scowled at him as he hissed in a deep, quiet voice, “Just how much of your mana have you covered her in?”</p><p>Considering she wasn’t displaying even half of her charms, Ferdinand remained silent.</p><p>“Gods,” Sylvester groaned, pinching his nose. “When we get back, we’re going to have a long talk, Little Brother.”</p><p>He could offer no protest for his mind was torn in two. Half of him was shocked and dismayed she would put on such a shameless display. The other half was lost in a blizzard.</p><p>Seeing her covered in his mana had pleased a part of him he hadn’t known existed. Something possessive rose in him, and for a moment, he had understood what it was to be Ewigeliebe.</p><p>He turned back towards her and noticed the looks on her retainer’s faces. Elvira was practically vibrating as her gaze flicked between the two of them, scrutinizing every twitch of a lip or quirk of a brow. Cornelius was ready to murder him. Matthias had a hand wrapped around Cornelius’s upper arm, a resigned look on his face. Ottilie had the same distant expression she wore whenever Hartmut or Clarissa began praising Rozemyne, Lieseleta had a stiff smile, Damuel stared forlornly into the distance, and Angelica…was Angelica.</p><p>Finally getting himself under control, Ferdinand sighed and held out a hand to his fiancée as he pulsed mana into his ear cuff.</p><p>She took his hand with the predatory smile of a merchant and said, “Hello, Ferdinand.”</p><p>“What has possessed you to dress so shamelessly. Surely you understand the implications of displaying so many charms made with my mana. Did I not tell you to keep them hidden? How could Elvira and Florencia allow this to happen? What did you do to make them take all leave of their senses? You can’t have realized what you’ve done, or you wouldn’t so brazenly display how comfortable you are with my mana. They will think me Ewigeliebe.”</p><p>“That is the intent,” she replied, sending him to new heights of anger he hadn’t experienced since the previous weave. “Part of it, at any rate. I see your courtship necklace is visible. I should have given you another ear cuff or some hair clips, but I didn’t have time to brew any ice, so this will have to do.”</p><p>“Oh? And why were you considering covering me in ice?” he asked, his smile sweet as honey.</p><p>She returned it with one just as saccharine as she answered, “Because I want the entire country to think we’re a pair of Ewigeliebes. I will not take a second husband once I become Aub Alexandria, and this modest display of ice should scare off any potential suitors. After all, who could hope to dye me when I’m so thoroughly covered in your mana?”</p><p>His ears burned as he hissed an admonishment at her, trying to block out the thoughts her words conjured. It didn’t help that at this angle, he could see slightly more of the shadow between her bountiful blessings from Anwachs.</p><p>“It will also work as a deterrent for anyone who wants to offer you a mistress,” she said. “I simply will not entertain the thought of you having another woman. This should keep pests from circling my Geduldh since no one else could survive with this much of your mana on their skin.”</p><p>“They will accuse me of summoning winter before autumn, you fool!”</p><p>She snorted. “Mother said you can simply explain that you have to take extreme measures to protect the incarnation of Mestionora. You can even bring up that I was recently kidnapped because of my knowledge and that were it not for my protections, I might have suffered an unspeakable fate.”</p><p>“How did you convince Florencia and Elvira to follow this foolish plan of yours?”</p><p>“Mother was easy. I appealed to the romantic in her. For Florencia, I explained that taking a second husband as a first generation aub might threaten the duchy’s neutrality since I can’t take a husband from the other two neutral duchies - Ehrenfest for obvious reasons, and Dunkelfelger because it would be a poor move politically for the Zent. It would be foolish to declare Alexandria the Wisdom of the Zent and one authorized to move against him if necessary and then marry his son to the Aub.”</p><p>Letting out a long sigh, Ferdinand asked, “Did it not occur to you we could simply turn them away for not being able to sense their mana?”</p><p>“Did it occur to you that some would be willing to enter into a white marriage to secure political power?”</p><p>As gratified as he was that she didn’t want to seek other partners, he couldn’t understand her reasoning. “Rozemyne, I know your…background emphasized monogamy, but I thought you’d come to accept the concept of multiple spouses.”</p><p>“The concept, yes,” she agreed. “Why? Do you want to have a mistress or for me to take a second husband?</p><p>“No,” he replied instantly.</p><p>With a smile, she said, “The problem is not the custom, Ferdinand. It’s you. I only want you, and I don’t want to share you with anyone else. I want to be the only one you look at, speak of Bluanfah to, or…” Her voice trailed off as she looked down, her hand coming to her cheek. His ears flamed again as he tried to banish thoughts of winter from his mind.</p><p>Suddenly, cold dread mixed with Brenwarmme’s heat in the pit of his stomach as he realized what he always feared others would see him as, she was. Never had he considered he might become Geduldh trapped in his Ewigeliebe’s ice.</p><p>Did that mean she knew he felt for her as the God of Darkness did the Goddess of Light and that she felt the same? Could she truly feel that way for him when he was nothing but–</p><p><em>Stop it,</em> he told himself. <em>How long will you continue to discount the feelings of others because of your origins?</em> Rozemyne had proven to him time and time again she viewed him as a person worthy of seeking happiness. Karstedt had opened his eyes to the respect the knights had for him as an individual. He could not allow himself to continue thinking of himself as a feystone, not when the people who thought of him as such had long since climbed the towering staircase or had never expressed such opinions in this weave.</p><p>In his heart, he still believed himself worthless, but if he reminded himself of the truth Rozemyne and Karstedt had shown him each time the voice in his head whispered otherwise, then surely one day, the voice would fade until he could no longer hear it.</p><p>As they neared their destination, they passed more and more people, each of whom stared openly at Rozemyne before they turned shock-filled eyes on him. He wanted to scream that whatever they thought was wrong, that the outfit had been chosen by her and her mothers, and that winter had not come, but instead, he maintained his stoic expression, willing the blush from his ears.</p><p>Soon, however, just as many eyes were on Dunkelfelger as Lestilaut escorted his wife to the seat of the first wife. Werdekraf and Sieglinde had been in that place at the beginning of the conference, so the onlookers would be unable to make sense of the change.</p><p>As they entered, someone in a black cape stopped Ferdinand and said, “This way, please.” When he resisted, the man said, “By order of the Zent.”</p><p>Gritting his teeth, Ferdinand looked at his brother who gave a resigned wave. This was it, then. From this moment forward, he was no longer a part of Ehrenfest. The loss at least wasn’t as painful as the first time it happened. He wouldn’t be going to meet his death but would instead begin building a new life with the woman he loved. The circumstances could not have been more different.</p><p>Ferdinand and Rozemyne followed the man to a pair of seats near Dunkelfelger. The stir that caused paled in comparison to when Anastasius escorted Eglantine to the section next to them, though it was Eglantine who sat in the aub’s seat. They nodded towards Ferdinand in greeting but then froze when they saw Rozemyne.</p><p>Ferdinand couldn’t read lips, but he was certain Anastasius had said, “That Ewigeliebe…”</p><p>Eventually, once everyone was seated, Trauerqual took the stage, causing the audience to erupt into whispers as they noticed the lack of crown on his head. Holding a voice-amplifying magic tool, he offered the customary opening and then said, “It is with utmost joy and gratitude that I announce to you the Grutrissheit has been found.”</p><p>A roar went through the crowd, but a tense silence filled the room as Trauerqual knelt and Werdekraf walked onto the stage, wearing the robes of the High Bishop. On his chest was a new crest that depicted an open book with the Goddess of Light’s crown before it and the God of Darkness’s cape behind. He held up the sound-amplifying tool as he called forth his schtappe and said, “Grutrissheit!” The book appeared, and the silence vanished. Ferdinand couldn’t make heads nor tails of what anyone was saying, but he trusted Justus was parsing it out to report on later. Trauerqual took advantage of the clamor to slip off stage to sit with his first wife.</p><p>After a few moments, the new Zent glared at the audience as he cleared his throat, and the room grew quiet once again. “Aubs, truly, I was not the one who found the Grutrissheit. Instead, I was guided to it by the gods through their avatar, the incarnation of Mestionora. Representative of the gods, come forth.”</p><p>Ferdinand held out his hand to Rozemyne, and she gave him a questioning look. “Only as far as the stage,” he said. “It would not do to let you walk without an escort.”</p><p>Her face broke into a soft smile, and she took his hand, allowing him to escort her down the stairs. Gasps and murmurs followed in their wake. Only a few mentioned her charms. Most were focused on her new title. When they approached the stage, he leaned down and whispered, “Go all out.”</p><p>She froze for a moment but nodded as she let go of his hand before she ascended the stage.</p><p>“Incarnation of Mestionora,” Werdekraf began, “please show proof that you were a guide to the Book of Wisdom.”</p><p>In response, she took the tool from him and called forth her Grutrissheit.</p><p>The audience erupted, but when Werdekraf knelt before her, they were once again shocked into silence.</p><p>“Werdekraf, ye who were chosen by the gods, have shown proof of Zenthood to all assembled here.” She returned her schtappe to its original form and then produced the cape. “Just as the God of Darkness spreads his cloak across the sky, may your cloak cover the land.” A second schtappe appeared in her hand, which she transformed into the Goddess of Light’s crown, causing the audience to gasp. “Just as the Goddess of Light banishes the dark, may you be a guiding light for the children of Geduldh.” Then, she produced a third schtappe and transformed it into a stylus. Werdekraf raised a brow at her, but she gave him a reassuring smile as she began to draw the circle found at the end of the bible.</p><p>A pang of loss shot through Ferdinand as he recalled that snowy day when a different Rozemyne had poured her feelings into the most breathtaking blessing he’d ever seen, perfect in its balance and efficiency. Jealousy welled in him, a dark part of him wanting to yell at her, <em>Do you not know what that blessing meant to me?!</em></p><p>But no, she didn’t.</p><p>She wasn’t the one who’d bestowed it upon him.</p><p>As much as it hurt, he had to let it go and take solace in the knowledge that at least in this weave, it was used to fulfill a greater purpose.</p><p>“O mighty King and Queen of the endless skies…” As she began to chant the prayer, all of the feystones on her person began to glow.</p><p>Including the two dozen on her legs.</p><p>Ferdinand had made a mistake.</p><p>“O Mighty Eternal Five who rule the mortal realm,” she continued as though she didn’t notice how she shone like the stars in the night sky with her courtship necklace glowing like the sun. “O Goddess of Water Flutrane, O God of Fire Leidenschaft, O Goddess of Wind Schutzaria, O Goddess of Earth Geduldh, O God of Life Ewigeliebe...</p><p>“Please hear my prayer and graciously lend your blessings. I offer you my power and devote to you my service and gratitude. May your divine protection be granted to your chosen Zent—the power of Water to wash away corruption, of Fire that cannot be extinguished, of Wind that wards against danger, of Earth that embraces all, and of Life that never relents. May he have them one and all.”</p><p>The lights of her charms winked out as the mana flowed into the magic circle. It rose above the Zent and then burst into a shower of every color.</p><p>And so the most beautiful blessing Ferdinand had ever witnessed, given by the most beautiful woman he’d ever known, fell on Zent Werdekraf.</p><p>As the lights of the blessing began to fade, Rozemyne bade him stand and said into the sound-amplifying tool, “Kneel to the king chosen by the gods, Zent Werdekraf!” She gracefully took a knee first, followed a heartbeat later by Ferdinand, then Trauerqual. Those from Ehrenfest, Dunkelfelger, and the former royal family were the first in the audience to kneel, prompting everyone else to comply. To Ferdinand’s surprise, Klassenberg had been one of the first after Ehrenfest to kneel, though the aub was pale. It seemed the new Zent had arranged a private meeting with him beforehand and taken measures to ensure his loyalty.</p><p>He took back the sound-amplifying tool from Rozemyne, and he helped her to her feet. “Thank you,” he whispered before signaling to Ferdinand. Rozemyne dismissed her schtappes as he climbed the stairs. Then, he escorted his fiancée, now known to all as an incarnation of a goddess, to their seats.</p><p>“Now then,” Zent Werdekraf said, “I shall announce the real changes.”</p>

<p>The weight of Cornelius’s livid stare bored into Ferdinand’s back, but he ignored it. It was nothing compared to the anger radiating from Sylvester and Karstedt a few sections down. Rozemyne, to his chagrin, seemed pleased with herself. Just picturing the multiple headaches the incident would grant him made him want to wipe that smug little smirk off her face with a heavy application of cheek pinching.</p><p>The assembly had just started, and enduring the wild swing of his emotions had exhausted him. He didn’t know how much more turmoil he could physically handle. Silently, he grasped the charm at his wrist and sent mana and prayers to Verfuhremeer, hoping divine intervention would be enough to get him through the rest of the meeting.</p><p>Werdekraf’s commanding voice drew him out of his prayers as the new Zent began to announce his sweeping changes. “Through the guidance of Mestionora, I have uncovered the hidden origins of our country. With this knowledge, I shall return Yurgenschmidt to the old ways as the gods intended. As you may already know, the first Zent was also High Bishop. However, that was not unique to him. All Zents for many, many generations were High Bishops. This will be the first change I shall enact.”</p><p>“He can’t be serious,” came a whisper from someone in the crowd.</p><p>“I know religious ceremonies are important, but…”</p><p>“Will he live in the temple, then?”</p><p>Werdekraf continued, silencing the whispers. “The Zents of that time did not live in the palace, nor did they live in the Sovereign Temple. They instead lived here in the Royal Academy, the country’s first temple.”</p><p>That sent a shock through the crowd. It seemed many had not pieced together that the Academy was in fact a temple despite all the evidence. Then again, nearly everyone present had spent little to no time in the temples of their duchies, so they had no basis for comparison.</p><p>Werdekraf went on to declare the closing of the palace and Sovereign temple and the dissolution of the Sovereignty with plans to move all operations to the Academy.</p><p>“Now, for the reason you’re all here - the rankings, but first, I will tell you of an attack on our country that we successfully fended off. Lanzenave, with whom we had a long-standing relationship, invaded our lands, kidnapped the incarnation of Mestionora, sent Prince Sigiswald to the distant heights, and attempted to steal Yurgenschmidt’s foundation.”</p><p>The audience took in a collective gasp, and several eyes turned to Anastasius. He continued to look forward, however, unwilling to meet their curious gazes.</p><p>Even more gazes fell on Trauerqual, who also maintained his composure. His wife, however, had bowed her head, perhaps as a show of respect to the departed, or perhaps to hide her expression.</p><p>Ferdinand had wondered how they would handle the betrayal of some of the Sovereign knights and the death of the first prince. Placing all the blame on the Lanzenavians was the simplest, most logical solution, and it was at least partially true.</p><p>“The Sword of the Zent, Dunkelfelger, and the Shield of the Zent, Ehrenfest, heeded the call of Mestionora and together with Ahrensbach defended our foundation and defeated the invaders. I myself closed the country gate. Never again will Lanzenave threaten Yurgenschmidt.”</p><p>He then went on to detail various “deeds of valor” of knights from the three duchies, including Wilfried, and then waxed poetic about Ferdinand’s role in stopping the ships and Rozemyne’s part in transporting the kidnapped victims to safety.</p><p>“Such valiant actions deserve a reward, and indeed, I shall give it to them when I redraw the borders. Dunkelfelger will receive the land they were already promised, and they will be ranked First.</p><p>“Two new duchies will be created. The first, Corinzdaum, will be created from the former Zausengas, Trostwerk, and part of the Sovereignty. For her bravery in defending the Academy alongside the former third queen, the former Princess Eglantine will be named Aub Corinzdaum. They will be ranked Fourth.”</p><p>Giving members of the former royal family an artificially high ranking would signal to everyone that Zent Weredekraf held no ill will against them.</p><p>“The second duchy, Alexandria, will be made from the former Scharfer, half of old Werkestock, and part of the Sovereignty. This duchy, like Dunkelfelger and Ehrenfest, shall remain neutral as the Wisdom of the Zent. Alexandria’s library will hold at least one copy of all printed materials, but more importantly, it will ensure the path to the Grutrissheit is never lost again. The incarnation of Mestionora will be Aub Alexandria upon her coming of age. Until then, her fiancé, Lord Ferdinand, will act as relay aub. They will be ranked Third.”</p><p>“Aub at fifteen? Is he serious?” someone muttered.</p><p>“<em>All</em> printed materials? Won’t their library be larger than the one at the royal palace and Academy combined?” asked another.</p><p>“If he’s only relay aub, then he can’t take a second wife.”</p><p>“Would you <em>want </em> to be married to Ewigeliebe?”</p><p>Ferdinand closed his eyes and sighed, feeling a headache coming right at his temples. He might have given her a few too many charms, but how else was he supposed to protect her from all that would harm her, including the gods? Truth be told, however, he hadn’t realized she was wearing all of them at the same time and that she’d lined her thighs with them. The only charms he’d designed to go on her legs were the enhancement bangles to help her move, which she no longer wore, and the two anklets. The rest had been meant for her arm, but it seemed with the mana chain sleeve taking their place, she’d decided to get creative.</p><p>Gods, he’d already had several marks against him, such as his time in the temple and his disagreeable personality, but now he’d be known as an Ewigeliebe who called winter before autumn and <em>flaunted it in front of the entire country.</em></p><p>Well, Rozemyne would certainly get her way. Someone would have had to take leave of all their senses to want to approach either of them with offers or marriage or mistresses.</p><p>More importantly, he would need to start planning for when their rank dropped at the next Archduke Conference. With their duchy mostly comprised of abandoned lands, it would be impossible to maintain Third. He didn’t doubt Rozemyne’s ingenious ideas and natural ability to gain allies and unify warring factions would see them take it again in the future. However, the inevitable loss in the meantime would strike a terrible blow to morale.</p><p>Ferdinand pulled himself out of his thoughts as Zent Werdekraf continued speaking. He explained Drewanchel would receive what remained of the Sovereignty since their concession from the civil war, Adolphine joining the royal family, had been taken away. They rose to Second.</p><p>Aub Drewanchel looked suitably pleased with the outcome.</p><p>“Because Ahrensbach was unable to prevent Lanzenave from accessing the Royal Academy,” he said, “they will cede land to Ehrenfest and drop to Ninth.”</p><p>The hiss of whispers filled the air, some sounding pitying, others accusatory. Lucius weathered the attention well, maintaining a noble expression for once.</p><p>The zent’s expression darkened, and his voice dropped into a near growl as he said, “As you know, we lost many nobles during the purge after the civil war, some of whom should have been spared, such as the Royal Academy librarians. They were unable to swear loyalty to the royal family because they had already sworn themselves to Mestionora.</p><p>“The purge was so excessive that we, even all these years later, are suffering from a mana drought. People starve in much of our lands. The curriculum was watered down for an entire generation, and we’ve been forced to forgo treasure-stealing ditter in favor of speed ditter, which has led to a decline in the abilities of our knights.</p><p>“Klassenberg was the driving force behind the purge that nearly brought Yurgenschmidt to its knees. Thus, not only will they lose the territory they were managing, but they will cede land to Ehrenfest as well and drop to Eighth.”</p><p>Aub Klassenberg’s lips were pulled into a tight line, and his forehead glistened with sweat as what little color was left in his face drained away. Ferdinand wasn’t sure what Zent Werdekraf had threatened them with to keep them in line, but it must have been truly horrific for the aub to not even offer a furrowed brow in protest.</p><p>“Ehrenfest, who defended Yurgenschmidt and whose archduke candidate led me to my Wisdom, shall be recognized as a greater duchy and take Fifth.”</p><p>With a dignified smile, Sylvester crossed his arms and bowed to the zent. He was a couple of shades paler than normal, though. He’d known it was coming, but having the gazes of all present boring into him obviously proved uncomfortable.</p><p>With the new rankings, Hauchletzte and Gilessenmeyer were Sixth and Seventh. Ferdinand imagined they wouldn’t hold their ranks for long, either, since a large part of where they sat had to do with their connections to the royal family.</p><p>The rest of the rankings remained the same.</p><p>“The lines will be redrawn at the beginning of summer,” Werdekraf announced. “Now then! Let's get the minor things out of the way!”</p><p>He went on to list several other reforms, including allowing priests and shrine maidens to marry, the children of the Zent would be considered archduke candidates of the Zent’s home duchy, the Zent and those who served them would all wear white capes, and Academy professors would continue to wear black capes to signify their neutrality.</p><p>At that, Trauerqual, Ralfrieda, Queen Sieglinde, who had slipped in to sit at the front when Ferdinand escorted Rozemyne to the stage, and Werdekraf’s retinue stood and flipped their capes, revealing the white lining they’d added. Or perhaps it was more accurate to say they revealed the true color and hid the lining that had been showing throughout the conference.</p><p>“More announcements will be made over the course of the conference,” Werdekraf said. “The next meeting will be five days hence at fifth bell. Then, we will meet again on the last day to perform a Dedication Ritual after which I will give my final updates for the year. You are dismissed.”</p><p>The zent descended the stage to take his wife’s hand and escorted her from the room, their retinues, Trauerqual, and the former first queen following in their wake.</p><p>The moment the doors closed behind them, the entire chamber erupted in roars of questions, demands, outrage, and confusion. Several descended upon Klassenberg and Ehrenfest, some on Ahrensbach and Dunkelfelger, and the rest on Ferdinand and Eglantine.</p><p>“You dare overtake Glissenmeyer with a new duchy made from the leavings of the civil war?” Aub Glissenmeyer snapped.</p><p>“You dare speak so openly against a decision made by the Zent?” Ferdinand replied. “Alexandria, for one, serves at the behest of the Zent.”</p><p>That gave the man pause. He’d evidently grown used to speaking from a place of power since he had connections to the defunct royal family.</p><p>Aub Drewanchel took the opportunity to step in at the abrupt break in conversation. “Lord Ferdinand, soon to be Aub Alexandria, shall we meet when your schedule allows?”</p><p><em>And so it begins,</em> Ferdinand thought with a sigh. He gave a signal to Janrik who stepped forward to coordinate with the aub’s attendant.</p><p>The First Wife of Drewanchel addressed Rozemyne while they talked. “I would dearly love to have you at one of my tea parties, Lady Rozemyne.”</p><p>“Oh, dear,” she replied, placing a troubled hand on her cheek, “I’m afraid that as an underaged archduke candidate, I was only permitted to participate in this meeting. I am retiring to Ehrenfest this afternoon.”</p><p>“Oh, how disappointing,” she sighed. “I had hoped to discuss how our printing industry is coming along and discuss the new books we’ve created.”</p><p>The excitement and longing in Rozemyne’s eyes was nearly pronounced enough to make Ferdinand a little jealous. He began to reach for her hand to physically hold her back from accepting, but she said, “I dearly wish I could hear of it myself. Alas, I must rely on my fiancé to inform me of all the updates from the conference once he returns. Perhaps we will have another opportunity to speak when our threads intersect once again.”</p><p>“It seems Dregarnuhr’s weaving has been swift,” Ferdinand said. “It is time for my fiancée to return, and I must escort her.” He offered parting pleasantries before taking Rozemyne’s hand and swiftly fleeing the room, setting a brisk pace for the dormitory. She easily kept in step with him, even her breathing remaining even. The gods truly had given her a healthy body, and her desire to protect all she held dear enabled her to strengthen it.</p><p>The knowledge continued to give him no end of relief.</p><p>When they arrived back at the dorms, Rozemyne directed her attendants to begin packing while Ferdinand asked Janrik and Justus to prepare a meeting room. Rozemyne immediately tried to say her goodbyes, but he tightened his grip on her hand and smiled at her. “You will be returning to Ehrenfest soon, no? We will meet now while you have time.”</p><p>“Oh, but my packing—“</p><p>“Can continue without you.”</p><p>He saw the moment she gave in and took her to the prepared room. “Turn around,” he told his retainers.</p><p>With a sigh, Rozemyne told hers to do the same. When Cornelius started to protest, Elvira gave him a withering look. “You would disobey your lady’s orders?” she asked.</p><p>“N-no, it’s just… How can you stand by and let your daughter be with her fiancé unsupervised?!”</p><p>“I didn’t think I raised a fool,” she said. “Is it not obvious what is about to take place?”</p><p>Cornelius blinked at her and then looked to Ferdinand. Whatever he saw sent a visible shudder through him, and he spun on his heel, more than happy to face the wall.</p><p>With the final obstacle out of the way, Ferdinand activated his ear cuff. When he received the pulse indicating it had connected to hers, he launched into his lecture. “Rozemyne, it was brazen enough for you to expose your arms to show off your protective charms. I cannot fathom what possessed you to put even more charms on your legs. It’s beyond shameless. You cannot use the excuse of playing Ewigeliebe for such an action, unless you mean to tell me you planned to make every feystone on your person shine like the noonday sun!”</p><p>“That was your fault!” she protested. “You’re the one who told me to go all out!”</p><p>“What fool would take that as license to show off the location of all her protective charms?!”</p><p>“I didn’t know they would glow like that! I’ve never ‘gone all out’ before, so how was I supposed to predict I’d light up like a [#%+*^] tree?!”</p><p>He sighed and tapped the side of his head. “There you go with that incomprehensible language of yours. Regardless, it shouldn’t have mattered at that moment if they glowed because you shouldn’t have had any charms on your legs to begin with, save for the anklets that are always visible regardless.” At least those Sylvester hadn’t given him any grief for since they weren’t in contact with her skin.</p><p>“Well where else was I supposed to put them?” she demanded, standing up and holding up the arm with the mana chain sleeve. “The arm they used to be on is already covered, and I don’t have any room left on the other!”</p><p>“Fool, the sleeve replaced all of those! Did you think I would leave you with subpar protection?”</p><p>“Bwuh?” she spluttered, uttering a sound he hadn’t heard in years. “But you were the one who told me to wear all my charms!”</p><p>“Yes, when you needed all of them. Obviously, the sleeve replaced those. Did you not remove the enhancement bracelets once you no longer needed them?”</p><p>She blinked at him.</p><p>“Even if you truly thought I meant for you to continue wearing the arm bangles, why would you put them…put them…<em>there?!</em>” He covered his eyes with a hand and heaved a sigh. “You shouldn’t have felt anything from the enhancement bracelets because they relied on your mana to function. Those charms, however, are filled with mine. Do you not understand? Are you unable to feel it?”</p><p>When she didn’t answer, he lowered his hand and found her looking away from him and fidgeting, painted in Geduldh’s color.</p><p>His jaw dropped in disbelief.</p><p>How shameless could she be?!</p><p>His hand shot across the table and pinched her red cheek. “You…! You’re fourteen! How could you do something so… so… so lewd?! How could you let a man’s mana touch you in such an intimate place <em>for such an unspeakable purpose?!</em>”</p><p>“Ah sawee! Eh na wa ah-“</p><p>“Silence, you!” he barked. “I will not hear your excuses! I have struggled against Brenwarmme’s heat, feeling disgusted with myself for even having his fires kindle within me, and you render useless my efforts and use the mana meant to protect you to do such a thing?!”</p><p>Her tearful eyes widened in shock, and he let her go, collapsing in his chair and resting his face on his folded hands.</p><p>“Ferdinand, I-“</p><p>“No,” he said. “I said I will not hear your excuses.”</p><p>She huffed and snapped, “Would you just listen to me?!” He remained silent, so she continued, “It’s true that I can feel your mana, but the sensation isn’t very strong because I’m already dyed in your colors. Surely you’ve noticed how your courtship necklace feels closer to your own creation than something filled with someone else’s mana.”</p><p>He let one of his hands drift down to the feystone hanging from his neck and felt the gentle caress of her mana. It was true. While it was slightly different thanks to her wind element being a touch stronger than the rest, it felt very similar to the charms he’d made for himself.</p><p>“Trust me, if I did derive that kind of pleasure from them, I wouldn’t be wearing them on my thighs in public.”</p><p>“Are you implying you’d wear them in private, then?” he asked, not bothering to hide the anger in his voice.</p><p>“What I do in private is none of your business!” she snapped back. “I don’t ask what you do when I leave the hidden room, do I?”</p><p>His ears flared as his eyes widened. Had she known that he’d…?</p><p>“This conversation is over,” he said, refusing to look at her. “Go prepare for your departure.”</p><p>“Fine,” she said. “Oh, and I won’t wear them anymore since you were gracious enough to explain that I don’t need to. You can tell anyone who asks that they were worn over my socks.”</p><p>His head snapped up. “What?!”</p><p>With a snort, she crossed her arms and said, “You just assumed I had them against my skin? All the ones that require skin contact are on my arms. Who’s really the lewd one here?”</p><p>“You didn’t say-“</p><p>“You didn’t ask.”</p><p>He gaped at her, and she gave a frustrated sigh. “I get where you’re coming from. You’ve always been mindful of our ages, and I would also be upset if someone underaged was using my mana to [#%#^?&amp;$], especially if I were in my late twenties.”</p><p>Ferdinand had the strong impression he did not want the translation to that word.</p><p>“This was the result of a communication failure on both our parts,” she said. “We can talk about this later in the hidden room. For now, I… I apologize for not explaining myself. And looking back, yeah, I could see how you would assume I knew arm bangles weren’t meant for legs, even if they expand to fit. I’m also sorry I made you feel bad about yourself, but Ferdinand…”</p><p>He looked at her, not trusting himself to speak.</p><p>“There’s no reason to feel disgusted with yourself. I’m less than a season away from my autumn, and I know how old I look. It’s natural to feel Brenwarmme’s heat for someone you care about like this.” Her eyes darted to her mother’s back and said, “Well, that’s what Mother and Florencia say. They told me not to tease you too much because you would be feeling the same way.”</p><p>Lowering his head, he pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed, his ears heating again. He knew she was trying to explain that even her mothers thought his feelings were, if not acceptable, perfectly normal. However, he couldn’t move past his self-loathing for looking upon her that way while she yet attended the Academy.</p><p>“Rozemyne,” he said, not looking up, “I apologize for my…lack of explanation when I gave you the mana chain sleeve. …And for the way I reacted. I realize a calm, collected conversation would have revealed the truth of the matter and somewhat settled things.”</p><p>“Thank you, Ferdinand,” she said in a soft, forgiving tone. “I will see you at dinner. Try not to let Sylvester yell at you too much.”</p><p>The warmth in his ear cuff disappeared, and she left with her retainers. He didn’t see the looks on their faces because he remained in his chair, his eyes closed and head bowed. <em>Could this day get any more exhausting?</em> he wondered.</p><p>“Ferdinand!” Sylvester boomed as he burst through the door. “How convenient you’ve already prepared a meeting room. Let’s talk.”</p><p>
<em>Ah, perfect.</em>

<p>My beautiful, talented, headache-inducing daughter came out of the teleportation room wearing a dress that made her look like the adult she was actually going to be in a season. I recognized it immediately, even with all the alterations. It was Florencia’s whirling outfit from when she played the Goddess of Wind. Florencia had it made to show off the courtship necklace I’d given her that year, just as Rozemyne was doing now with the one she’d received from Ferdinand.</p><p>She’d had the hem taken up since she wasn’t of age yet, and Queen Sieglinde had sent thin, veil-like fabric to further alter the dress, including the floating sleeves that were popular in the southern parts of the country. For such a short time frame, they’d done an excellent job.</p><p>Seeing my daughter in my wife’s whirling outfit would have nearly brought me to tears if it weren’t for the ice covering her arms ruining the effect. The bracelets and arm bangles I’d known about; Ferdinand and I had already had a discussion about them. The sleeve of feystones, however, was an excessive addition.</p><p>How many times had I told my little brother not to cover her in ice? Despite being an unprecedented genius, he could be the biggest idiot when it came to this stuff, and here he was, covering her in his ignorance. I knew my brother. I knew he thought, “She’s been targeted so many times, and she nearly got kidnapped again. I came so close to losing her. The only solution is to cover her in so many protective charms that if anyone even looks at her askance, they’ll go up in golden flames.” I wasn’t concerned by the excessive number of charms. Well, I was, but it wasn’t out-of-character for him, so it was more embarrassing than aggravating.</p><p>What was far more concerning was the smile on Rozemyne’s face. That feystone sleeve combined with the other charms, the courtship necklace, and the matching ear cuffs should have had her curled up on the floor in violent shudders with the sheer amount of foreign mana touching her skin. She, however, didn’t have the slightest sign of distress. I knew she’d learned how to hide her emotions and pain pretty well over the years, but no one could hide that much discomfort. Well, except for maybe Ferdinand.</p><p>I glanced at my little brother to see his reaction, expecting the same stoic expression with maybe a slight hint of annoyance, but boy, was I surprised. The man was completely dumbstruck. Even his mouth was hanging open. I couldn’t tell if he was shocked because she was gorgeous or because she’d just shown off all her protections.</p><p>At least, I <em>hoped</em> that was all of her protections.</p><p>Either way, his pink ears clenched it for me. Either he was embarrassed because he’d just realized how much of his mana was on her skin or because he’d just been caught. It didn’t matter which one. Pinching the bridge of my nose, I sighed as I gripped Ferdinand’s shoulder and hissed, “Gods, when we get back, we’re going to have a long talk, Little Brother.”</p><p>For a moment, he looked like he wanted to crawl up the towering staircase and greet the Supreme Couple. I still didn’t know if that meant he was ashamed of covering her in ice or for the rest of us finding out he’d been covering her in ice. Either way, that was a problem for future Sylvester. Present Sylvester had a foundation-shattering assembly to attend.</p><p>I pulled out a sound-blocking tool and slipped it to Florencia as I escorted her from the dorm. “What the hell, Florencia?”</p><p>She held her peaceful smile as she replied, “She’s going to be one of the youngest aubs in history of a new duchy riddled with issues that would make most other aubs cry themselves to sleep for months, all while maintaining neutrality, meaning she ostensibly can’t acquire allies. Showing how extensively Ferdinand is protecting the incarnation of a goddess will not only signal to others that she’s not the easy target her age makes her out to be but also that she won’t accept other suitors. That will prevent opportunistic duchies, such as the soon-to-be-fallen Klassenberg, from trying to circumvent their neutral status before its fully established.”</p><p>“Well, it certainly makes a statement,” I muttered. “Still, as a female aub, it’s easy enough to turn down second husbands.”</p><p>My wife giggled. “It also discourages women from offering themselves as mistresses to her Dark God.”</p><p>“Okay, he’s my brother, and I love him, but seriously, who would want to be his mistress?” I asked. “He’s famous for hating any woman but Rozemyne, and he’s been called an Ewigeliebe since she started at the Academy with that giant courtship necklace. No one wants to be Geduldh trapped in ice.”</p><p>Florencia raised a brow at me.</p><p>“Hey, that’s just when we play around. Besides, you’re the one who always wants– You know what? I’m going to stop talking.”</p><p>“A wise decision.”</p><p>It was a little depressing to think that soon I’d have to forgo winter games with Florencia in favor of synchronizing with my daughter’s guard knight. Neither Natalie nor I were exactly looking forward to it, but if she didn’t have at least one child, it’d ruin whatever goodwill my second marriage would garner with the Liesegangs. For a moment, I was jealous that my little brother would get to stay true to his all-goddess, but then again, if Father and I had both been better aubs, I wouldn’t have had to take a Liesegang wife to begin with.</p><p>At least Charlotte had learned from our mistakes.</p><p>When the Sovereignty noble directed Ferdinand and Rozemyne to follow him, I felt an entwickeln erect a wall between us. My little brother and daughter were no longer Ehrenfest nobles. With a resigned wave, I sent them on their way. I’d known it was coming for a while now, basically ever since I first learned my kids were on the path to their Wisdom. Out of my four kids, Rozemyne was the easiest to take, and she was a package deal with Ferdinand. I didn’t want either of them to leave, of course, but it was the way things had to be.</p><p>We got a few questioning looks as we walked to our seats, but no one said anything. As we settled down, Aub Ahrensbach came over and offered us a noble greeting. Once pleasantries were out of the way, I asked, “How are things in Ahrensbach?”</p><p>He gave me a weary smile, an expression that highlighted the few differences between his face and my brother’s. “They’re settling down. Letizia wanted me to thank you for the picture books Lady Rozemyne sent afterwards. It’s a chore to get her to put them down long enough for her lessons.”</p><p>Florencia laughed and said, “Oh, my! It sounds like she’s doing well after everything, at least.”</p><p>His smile warmed. He really was a bit too open for a noble, but it wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. “She is,” he said. “It seems she’s developed a bit of an attachment to your daughter. She sees her as her personal heroine.”</p><p><em>Oh, great. Another worshiper,</em> I thought. Rozemyne had enough of them already, and she would probably gain even more after today’s meeting. “They’ll be at the Academy together with her next year, right?”</p><p>“Indeed. She’s growing fast,” he said. Gods, he really was a doting father. This man was far too similar to Myne. I would have suspected him of being another commoner in disguise if it weren’t for his resemblance to both Ferdinand and the man from Lanzenave. That all three were related was without question, but how was another matter. I could surmise that Gervasio and Lucius were father and son, but I didn’t know the connection between Gervasio and Ferdinand. They looked just alike, so it was evident they were closely related. Had Gervasio been a woman, I would have suspected him of being my brother’s mother. Still, how Ferdinand had any blood connection to Lanzenave was beyond me since he hadn’t shared anything with me. It hurt that my little brother couldn’t trust me with the truth, but he’d never once spoken of his time before he came to Ehrenfest, and now knowing it involved Lanzenave, I could only assume it was for good reason.</p><p>We exchanged a few more pleasantries before Lucius went to find his seat. By then, a bit of a commotion had stirred around where Ferdinand was sitting. Glancing over, I saw Anastasius and Eglantine had entered with the latter taking the aub’s seat.</p><p>“And so it begins,” I muttered. Once again, I was struck with the unfairness of it all. If the royal family had just done what they were supposed to - actually, if there hadn’t been a royal family to begin with, then my brother and daughter wouldn’t be caught up in this mess. They could be living out their lives happily in Ehrenfest rather than running a greater duchy whose land had been impoverished thanks to the royal family’s bickering leading to a civil war and massive purge.</p><p>My frustration must have been leaking through my aub mask because Florencia patted my hand and said, “Eyes forward.”</p><p>With a sigh, I nodded and braced myself as the former King Trauerqual took the stage.</p><p>Things proceeded about as I expected from there until Ferdinand escorted Rozemyne to the stage. He whispered something in her ear that lit that dangerous gremlin spark in her eye, and sure enough, an unexpected rampage followed. Rozemyne cast a breath-taking blessing, but in doing so, every feystone on her body lit up, including what appeared to be some faint lights on her legs, though it was impossible to tell how many. At least half a dozen, though.</p><p>“Florencia?!” I hissed after passing her a sound-blocking tool.</p><p>She shook her head. “I didn’t know about those,” she said. “Well, Ottilie and Lieseleta wouldn’t have let her wear anything inappropriate.”</p><p>Meaning they wouldn’t let her wear anything with direct skin contact on her legs that someone else had made. Given the anklets, which were glowing just as brightly, were outside her socks, it stood to reason the others were as well. What wasn’t reasonable was just how many there were. Sighing, I closed my eyes and said, “This is why everyone calls him Ewigeliebe. I get why he’s so protective. I do, but there are limits.”</p><p>Florencia placed a hand on her cheek. “Have you ever told him what those limits are?”</p><p>“Huh? Yeah, of course I…” I trailed off and furrowed my brows. I had told him, “Don’t cover her in ice,” and “You have a tendency to go overboard - don’t,” and things of that nature. I’d never given him an exact number.</p><p>I wanted to hold my head in my hands and howl at my idiocy. My little brother had only been in a “relationship” one other time, and it was an engagement with a woman who immediately got herself engaged to her teacher instead. Even what he had now with Rozemyne wasn’t entirely romantic, at least not yet. I knew he cared about her, of course, but he still largely viewed her as someone in need of his protection - for good reason, sure, but this was a man who didn’t know what “restraint” meant. When told to do well, he went and got first in class in every course he could take. When he compressed, he pushed himself to the point of sickness and ended up with more mana than anyone in the country.</p><p>Rather than say, “Hey, Sylvester, I actually have a lot of work to do now that I’m High Priest, so could you stop sending so much my way?” he would just complete whatever I sent him while forgoing sleep. It wasn’t until Rozemyne said something that I even knew he was struggling, but maybe more importantly, neither did he. He had no frame of reference for “normal” amounts of work.</p><p>As his older brother, I should have known he wouldn’t know what a “normal” number of charms would be. Instead, I gave him vague limits, and he interpreted them in the context of, “How many does she need until I know she’s safe?” rather than, “How many should you have your underaged fiancée wear?” Again, he wouldn’t even be able to guess at the second number. I’d failed him.</p><p>“Well, what can we do now?” I asked. “I think most people will just think it’s excessive, but there are always those who will claim it’s snowing when they see a puddle of water.”</p><p>My wife waved a tired hand. “We’ll go with the original plan - that Ferdinand was tasked with protecting the incarnation of a goddess, but we’ll say she made many of the amulets herself.”</p><p>Given whose disciple she was, that was a real possibility. “Alright, I’ll trust you with women’s society, then. I’m sure it’ll come up there.”</p><p>“Of course,” she said. “It’s my duty as her mother.”</p><p>“Speaking of duty as a mother,” I said, “does it not bother you how much of Ferdinand’s mana Rozemyne is easily able to tolerate?”</p><p>She blinked at me. “What do you mean, ‘easily’?”</p><p>“Come on! Look at her! It doesn’t bother her at all.”</p><p>Quirking a brow at me, she said, “You would be surprised how much pain Rozemyne can mask. She’s also been wearing his amulets for years, so I imagine she’s grown used to the discomfort.”</p><p>I wasn’t buying it, but I knew from experience if I pressed the point, I would just earn myself a lecture on all the pain women have to endure under polite smiles, especially when Geduldh’s soil turned. I mean, I knew it was terrible what she had to deal with, but there was only so much I could do about it.</p><p>Regardless, I decided to turn my focus to what Zent Werdekraf was saying. When he announced just how far Klassenberg’s ranking would fall, I felt myself get lightheaded. There was no way they weren’t going to resent us, and I doubted the land we were getting from them would provide us with anything but a drain on our mana. We planned to spread the stages to the new lands so that they wouldn’t suffer under such a long winter, but there was no telling how long it would take for them to start reaping benefits from an early spring. Either way, we would have more chalices to fill but one less archduke candidate to offer mana.</p><p>At least it seemed Aub Klassenberg had been properly cowed, so he probably wouldn’t make any overt moves.</p><p>When the Zent left, the floodgates opened. Six different aubs, including my brother-in-law, descended upon me with questions.</p><p>“That was your daughter, right?” Aub Lortzing asked. “When did she obtain her Wisdom?”</p><p>“When Mestionora opened the path for her,” I replied. In retrospect, I really should have gone over possible questions and answers with everyone. For now, though, my audience would have to be happy with vague replies.</p><p>“How was she able to lead Aub– Zent Werdekraf to his Wisdom?” Aub Jossbrenner asked.</p><p>I held my hands up. “It was under the guidance of the gods.”</p><p>My brother-in-law stepped in then and said, “I am sorry to hear that she was put in danger because of her knowledge. Truly, she must be beloved by the gods to have survived not one but three attempted kidnappings.”</p><p>“Three?” one of the wives asked.</p><p>Holding back a sigh, I gave Aub Frenbeltag a noble smile. “Indeed. Ferdinand and I were able to protect her during the first attempt when she was still hidden in the temple, and my brother saved her after the second and third.”</p><p>“It’s no wonder he’s gone to such lengths to protect her, then,” he replied, his expression grave.</p><p>The others looked expectantly at me, so I nodded. “She is the incarnation of Mestionora, and as you just heard, there is reason to fear for her safety. That’s why he also taught her how to brew her own protective amulets. In fact…” I pulled the one she’d made me out from under my collar and showed off the rainbow feystone. “She’s made amulets for everyone in the family and her entire retinue. Her encounters have taught her to be wary.”</p><p>Florencia took the opportunity to show off her protective charm as well.</p><p>“Oh, she brews them personally?” Aub Jossbrenner asked. “I should have expected as much from the student who took first in class two years in a row for the scholar course.”</p><p>In the back, Aub Lindenthal said, “So some of them were hers.”</p><p>And just like that, the inferno had been banked to a roaring fire. Ferdinand would never escape his Ewigeliebe moniker, but at least anyone who tried to spread the worst kind of rumors would be silenced.</p><p>Eventually, Florencia and I found enough of a break in conversation to slip away, and to no one’s surprise, Ferdinand had already beat a hasty retreat. The man had a way of disappearing when he really wanted to.</p><p>When we got back to the dorms, Florencia caught sight of Rozemyne speeding up the stairs and left my side to chase after her. That was a conversation I was glad I would not be privy to.</p><p>Still, that meant she’d just been lectured by Ferdinand, and as I expected, he was still in the meeting room where he’d taken her, decompressing.</p><p>“Ferdinand!” I called as I entered the room. “How convenient you’ve already prepared a meeting room. Let’s talk.” With a wave of my hand, I got my head attendant to bring us a couple of glasses and a bottle of vize before ordering the room cleared.</p><p>I sat and grabbed the bottle, and before I could say a word, he launched into an explanation. “They were bracelets meant for her arms, The feystone sleeve was meant to replace them. She thought she was meant to wear all of them, so she put them on over her socks.”</p><p>“So-”</p><p>“We already argued about it.” He took the glass I offered him and drained it before holding it out again. I filled it for him as he continued, “Neither of us knew she would make all of her feystones glow. Honestly, I can’t imagine what her mothers and attendants were thinking letting her go out in such a…such a…provocative dress!” He drained the glass again.</p><p>“Hey, slow down, there,” I said, taking it from him. “First of all, there wasn’t anything wrong with the dress. In fact, that was my wife’s Dedication Whirl outfit.”</p><p>“But the sleeves–”</p><p>“Were provided by Queen Sieglinde. Gods, man, are you alright?”</p><p>It was a dumb question. Of course, he wasn’t alright. My cool, composed little brother was trying to drown himself in vize, and there was a storm brewing in his eyes. The man was at a breaking point.</p><p>“What must they think of me?” he grumbled. “It was scandalous enough showing off all the charms on her arms, but the ones on her legs!”</p><p>I rubbed my forehead, wondering what the hell kind of gentleman’s education he’d received to be reacting like this. “Look, Ferdinand, first of all, the aubs I talked to understood you’re just being overprotective after she got kidnapped, and thanks to our dear brother-in-law, the whole country is going to know within the next bell that she’s been abducted three times. And before you say anything, yes, some people already knew, but most hadn’t heard about the temple, or at least they hadn’t had it confirmed.” I went on to explain how we hinted that Rozemyne had made many of the charms that she wore, even displaying the ones she’d made for me and my wife to emphasize the point. “So if anyone thinks what you seem to be thinking they think, they’ll be denounced thoroughly, especially since the First and Second are enamored with you.”</p><p>Ferdinand gave me a baleful look, and it almost made me swallow my next words. “The number of charms isn’t the problem. Well, it’s not the problem I’m concerned with right now. My problem is that my daughter is covered from head to toe in your mana, and she doesn’t show the slightest sign of discomfort. Care to explain why, Little Brother?”</p><p>I stared at him, still holding his empty glass, and glared when he took the bottle. Holding up a hand, he poured me some vize and slid it over to me. With a dubious look, I took it, but I didn’t drink. Eventually, he sighed and rubbed his temples, his face pale. “Rozemyne’s constitution is…unique.”</p><p>“Because she’s a devourer?” I asked.</p><p>“Yes and no,” he replied. “Before she was baptized and came to the temple, she nearly died several times.”</p><p>That made me pull my lips into a tight line. I’d known she’d had to compress to survive, but I didn’t like hearing about how much she struggled back before I could do anything about it.</p><p>“She came so close to death so many times, in fact, that she started the process of becoming a feystone. That was why she had so many hardened mana clumps in and around her mana organ.”</p><p>I nodded, taking a sip of my drink. Ferdinand had more or less reported as much, though not in this light. He’d been more matter-of-fact, stating she’d had mana clumps that needed to be dissolved. It just sounded like a medical issue at the time. The way he worded it this time, however, made it infinitely more heartbreaking.</p><p>“That is called the Mark of Ewigeliebe. Devourers, by nature, are easier to dye, but because of the Mark, when I gave her the synchronization potion to read her memories, it ended up dyeing her mana organ completely and permanently.”</p><p>I stared at him.</p><p>He stared back.</p><p>“You… You dyed my daughter? <em>Permanently?!</em>”</p><p>“With medicine,” he said.</p><p>“Yeah, I got that,” I sighed, holding my forehead. “Gods, no wonder she isn’t bothered by all those charms. Just how similar is your mana?”</p><p>Ferdinand looked away for a long moment before his shoulders slumped in defeat. “Similar enough that she will not have to redye the foundation to become Aub Alexandria.”</p><p>“Good gods!” I gasped. “You’d have to be locked in winter for six months straight to get that dyed!”</p><p>His ears flushed as he muttered, “It was with medicine.”</p><p>“Yeah, I know!” I snapped. Scratching the back of my head, I asked, “If she were to take someone else’s synchronization potion, would she be redyed permanently?”</p><p>With a shrug, he said, “They’d have to overpower my mana, and now that she has a healthy body, I’m not certain it will continue to function the same way as it did before. Her color now may be considered her ‘true’ color. Or if someone’s able to overpower my mana, she may be permanently dyed their color. I couldn’t say without experimenting, which I am not inclined to do.”</p><p>“Not saying you should,” I replied. “That aside, let’s talk about why you think Rozemyne’s outfit was so improper. I mean, it was excessive with the charms, but…”</p><p>He furrowed his brows at me. “Did you not see everyone’s shocked reactions when they saw her in it?’</p><p>“You mean when they saw an underaged archduke candidate at the Archduke Conference?”</p><p>That made him blink.</p><p>“Alright, let’s get to the bottom of this.”</p><p>Ferdinand and I went through two bottles of vize as I investigated the cause behind his assumptions, and I could have done with another by the end of it. Over the years, different women had been sent to him with plans to weaponize winter against him, and the things they’d said to try to force him into complying had twisted his ideas of what constituted appropriate behavior, especially when combined with the vague remarks he’d get from people like me. His view of charms in particular came from one of them who’d gotten her hands on a couple of the trinkets he’d made while brewing. She’d publicly taunted him in the Ehrenfest dorms by saying he’d intended them for lewd purposes, claiming they were made for contact with the skin of the thigh. They’d actually been made to use around the ankle, but that was beside the point.</p><p>Of course, I had to glean all this from his hedgy answers and parse out the facts from what he left unsaid. It would have been easier to do without the vize, but that would have made it harder to endure hearing. He was careful not to mention my mother in all this, but it was obvious who was behind the whole thing. I could only hang my head in shame. Yet again, I was shown just how blind I was to my brother’s suffering. Just how pervasive was her torture? How horrible could the woman who raised me with such love be?</p><p>He eventually fell into silence, and after gathering my thoughts, I said, “That’s…not how it’s supposed to be. In fact, at least half of what they said was completely untrue, and the other half is dependent on context. That girl with the leg charms. First, even if you had made them with winter in mind, it wouldn’t have been any of her business unless you had given them to her. Even then, she could have just refused them. It’s not like you had forced them on her or anything.</p><p>“Even if she wanted to claim that… Yeah, it’s bad if someone forces a person to wear things imbued with their mana on their skin in a sensitive location, but it’s also so unlikely to happen to anyone with attendants that it’s basically a nonissue. I’m telling you, the first assumption anyone with half a brain would make in that case is either her attendants were flat out lying about the charms even existing or exaggerating about their placement. In Rozemyne’s case, the question might have existed, but everyone was instantly convinced she’d made those charms herself. Even Florencia’s first statement was, ‘Her attendants wouldn’t let her wear something inappropriate.’” Scratching my head, I tried to find another way to say it to get through to him, but he raised his hand to stop me.</p><p>“I understand,” he said. “It seems I’ve been working under many misguided notions. I’ll have to apologize to Rozemyne.”</p><p>“Wait, wait, wait,” I said. “Before you go off apologizing, you should know she wasn’t entirely faultless, either. I mean, she was the one that caused the questions to come up in the first place. The whole thing definitely makes you seem like an Ewigeliebe, which is what she was going for, but if you ask me, the problem here is that she didn’t include you on any of this. Like, wanting to stake a claim and all that? Fine. I get it. Believe me. But pulling that without telling you? Yeah, that’s a problem. I know Florencia and Elvira were in on it, but that was also before they knew about the charms on her legs. I don’t think either of them was expecting to have to do damage control on that.”</p><p>“You implied there wasn’t much damage to control,” Ferdinand replied accusingly.</p><p>“Not much, but still some,” I said. “Anyway, bottom line here is… You know, I don’t know where I was going with that. Well, in the end, she’s still an impulsive girl on the cusp of autumn, and it’s really not a whole lot worse than what I did when courting Florencia. I think, though, you should get on the same page with this…whatever it is with the chasing other suitors off thing. And we should address the holes in your gentlemen’s education.”</p><p>“Justus–”</p><p>“No. He’s competent, but he’s divorced, and he didn’t like his wife that much to begin with, right? He’s not going to understand all the intricacies between a loving couple. I’ll be handling this. Well, probably with Karstedt. Anyway, I can’t let my little brother bind his stars like this. I want you to be happy.”</p><p>Ferdinand’s gaze turned towards the table as he swallowed and nodded.</p><p>“We’ll start after we get back,” I said. “For now, let’s see if Schlaftraum can help with Vantole’s blessings.”</p><p>“I fear Schalftraum’s efforts will not be sufficient,” he grumbled, but when he followed me out of the room, he walked perfectly fine. He was way too good at holding his liquor.</p>

<p>Rozemyne had returned to Ehrenfest before Ferdinand’s conversation with Sylvester ended, and he decided not to contact her that night. He’d imbibed too much alcohol, and his emotions were too volatile to trust himself to have a conversation with her. He woke the next morning with a pounding headache and an anxious heart. A potion fixed the former, but there was nothing to do about the latter except try to ignore it. He had no meetings scheduled that morning since he hadn’t been announced as Aub Alexandria until the day before, so after tending to his headache, he got an update from Justus.</p><p>“Most conversations since the assembly have revolved around the new Zent, as you can imagine. The general mood is positive since everyone’s been waiting for a true Zent with Wisdom, but some are disgruntled with his additional duties as High Bishop. They’re worried he will force aubs to take on the role as well.”</p><p>“They’re not too far off the mark,” Ferdinand observed.</p><p>“Indeed, my lord,” Justus said. “There is much speculation about what role Lord Trauerqual will play now that he is no longer Zent, but the general consensus is that he’ll be a minister of some sort. Some talked about Klassenberg’s fall, though in very hushed whispers. It seems they are exercising caution in case the duchy finds a way to regain its former status.”</p><p>Ferdinand scoffed. “Unlikely, given the blame for the purge has been put squarely on their shoulders, and they’ve been reduced to a middle duchy.”</p><p>Justus shrugged as though it didn’t matter to him either way. “I caught more than one conversation about Ehrenfest’s promotion to a greater duchy. Many suspect it’s a show of favoritism since the Zent’s daughter is marrying Lord Wilfried. Others have wondered if Ehrenfest’s neutrality during the civil war was because of their role as Shield of the Zent, but since that would mean Dunkelfelger acted inappropriately by joining in the war, it didn’t progress much further than idle speculation.”</p><p>There were, of course, many conversations about the two new duchies and their aubs. Everyone was mindful of what they said of the former royal family given Eglantine’s appointment as aub of the Fourth, and they understood why Rozemyne, the incarnation of Mestionora, would become Aub Alexandria. No one debated her brush with divinity given she was able to obtain her Wisdom and lead the new Zent to his when no one else in the entire country had been able to locate it. Some talked about her excessive charms and how her fiancé guarded her like Ewigeliebe, but no one insinuated he’d done anything inappropriate. It likely helped that word about her attempted abductions, Ferdinand’s need to protect the incarnation of a goddess, and her brewing some of the charms herself had spread as fast as Stifebriese, just as Sylvester expected it would. However, thanks to Sylvester and Florencia showing off their impressive charms, some wondered if Ferdinand wasn’t just as covered under his robes as Rozemyne had been.</p><p>Many speculated that Alexandria and Corinzdaum would fall in the rankings at the next conference, especially since they would only have two suppliers each despite being greater duchies. Some wondered if Eglantine would take a second and third husband to combat this. Anyone who even brought up the same question regarding Rozemyne was practically laughed out of the room. It seemed Rozemyne’s plan had succeeded.</p><p>“Overall, the reaction to Rozemyne was positive,” Justus said. “The same cannot be said of Ahrensbach.”</p><p>Apparently, given Ahrensbach had lost both the territory they were managing and their northern provinces, some were saying their crimes must have been far graver than merely being unable to stop invaders from entering the Royal Academy. Because of the new Aub Ahrensbach’s close resemblance to Ferdinand, some wondered if the two were related, earning Lucius more lenient treatment thanks to Ferdinand’s close association with the new Zent. Apparently, his visits to the Dunkelfelger tea party room to watch ditter hadn’t gone unnoticed. Of course, after some probing, Ferdinand discovered the only ones talking about his possible relation to Lucius were aubs who would have been unfamiliar with Adalgisa. The others were content to keep their silence on the matter.</p><p>Justus then reported on the focus of most of the duchies’ trade. Of note were Drewanchel and Jossbrenner’s new sweetener, Ahrensbach’s blueprints for mana-efficient magic tools, and Klassenberg’s printed musical scores and books detailing dozens of art techniques. Since copies of the printed materials had already been provided to Sylvester, Ferdinand had no need to go out of his way to meet with Aub Klassenberg. That was just as well since Klassenberg had tried to meet with as many upper-ranking duchies as possible before the announcement so they could negotiate from a position of power. The aub’s schedule was likely to be filled with those who now ranked higher trying to renegotiate.</p><p>As for the blueprints, Ferdinand had overseen the development of most of them, so he had no interest in discussing them during the conference. The sweetener, however, would be worth discussing. Rozemyne had said that if it was what she thought it was, she had several uses for it, and Alexandria would need new trends to spread.</p><p>Justus also provided a long list of innocuous minor details that Ferdinand filed away in the back of his mind in case they proved useful later.</p><p>That afternoon, he met with Aub Drewanchel. After they exchanged pleasantries and erected a sound-blocking barrier, the man asked, “How did it come to pass that the Goddess of Wisdom herself descended upon your fiancée?”</p><p>“I am uncertain why Mestionora chose her,” Ferdinand replied with a shrug. “What mortal can fathom the whims of the gods?”</p><p>Quirking a brow, the aub pressed, “Was she truly visited by the goddess?”</p><p>“You doubt the Zent’s words?”</p><p>“Of course not,” he chuckled. “I merely wonder if perhaps Mestionora used more mundane means, such as having a mentor show her the path.”</p><p>Ferdinand offered him a smile to mask his annoyance as he replied, “There was no one else there to guide her. It was truly the work of the gods that led to her gaining her Wisdom and allowing the Zent to obtain his.” Not a word of that was a lie. If the gods had not rewoven the fabric, then neither Rozemyne nor Werdekraf would have obtained a complete Grutrissheit.</p><p>Aub Drewanchel hummed to himself, not satisfied but knowing he’d get no more answers from him. “Do you plan to have any major exports from Alexandria?”</p><p>“Books, naturally,” Ferdinand said. “Anything else will be revealed at the next Archduke Conference.”</p><p>“Perhaps you’ve heard of our newest export,” the aub said. “In our partnership with Jossbrenner, we were able to develop a new sweetener that we are finally able to debut.”</p><p>He began by offering the syrup at a ridiculous price, and Ferdinand brought him down to an unreasonable one before he pulled out one of Justus’s pieces of information combined with the other worldly knowledge Rozemyne had shared with him. “I understand this is made from the sap of an ahorn tree, which is boiled down until you get the dark, thick consistency you desire. The trees only grow in colder regions, but with the magic tool that can control climates within a facility, that wouldn’t prove an issue in warmer regions like Drewanchel…or Alexandria.”</p><p>Aub Drewanchel frowned at him, but Ferdinand merely shrugged. “I would rather not expend the resources on such a venture, but if it is more cost effective, then I suppose I am left with little choice.”</p><p>The price dropped to something more reasonable.</p><p>Once the agreements were made, Ferdinand looked at the aub’s clean plate and asked, “Did you find the lava cake to your liking?”</p><p>“Oh, indeed,” he said with a small smile. “Quite intriguing. The caramel sauce inside paired well with the lightly-sweetened cake. I would be most interested in a recipe.”</p><p>“Unfortunately, that particular recipe will not be made available for a couple of years,” Ferdinand said with a regretful grimace. “The future Aub Alexandria plans to release it in another recipe book.”</p><p>“How disappointing,” he said.</p><p>“I believe I could convince her to part with this particular recipe if she were to receive an offer of some kind.”</p><p>“Oh?” Aub Drewanchel asked. “Does she want to borrow books from my personal collection? I could provide one in exchange for the recipe.”</p><p>Rozemyne would have likely jumped on the offer, but unfortunately for her, that wasn’t what he was after. Shaking his head, he said, “She’s rather curious about gumka trees and their sap. If you would agree to give her a couple of saplings and a steady supply of sap over the next two years, then we could offer you exclusivity on the recipe for the same time frame. Not even Alexandria will use it.”</p><p>The aub raised his brows in surprise for a brief moment before he leveled a calculating look at Ferdinand. “What plans do you have for the gumka?”</p><p>He shrugged. “Her plans are her own.”</p><p>“Hmmm… You must have some other dazzling recipes if you’re willing to part with this when you will dearly need to disseminate trends as a new duchy.”</p><p>“I did say it was a recipe book she was releasing.”</p><p>Eventually, Aub Drewanchel shrugged. “It is a simple matter for us to collect the materials and have our merchants bring them to Ehrenfest this summer. We can discuss the logistics of delivering them to Alexandria at the next Archduke Conference after you have a better idea of the infrastructure you will have.”</p><p>The conversation shifted into research with the aub probing Ferdinand and Ferdinand dropping tidbits about old experiments of little import. Eventually, they started talking about patents, which led Aub Drewanchel to discuss some new tools they’d created that were protected under the new system, meaning Ferdinand wouldn’t be able to steal them. He considered whether he should patent the ear cuffs or not, but he decided against it. He didn’t want to advertise that he and Rozemyne could always be in contact so long as they were in the same duchy. Naturally, that meant the shumils would remain a secret between the two of them and their attendants. Merely imagining the ramifications of introducing interduchy communication devices gave him a headache.</p><p>Before long, Aub Drewanchel’s attendant gave him a signal, and he said, “Ah, it seems Dregarnuhr’s weaving was swift today. May you walk with the blessings of the gods until our threads cross once again.”</p><p>Ferdinand bade him goodbye and then went back to his room. “What are you planning to do with the gumka, my lord?” Justus asked, his eyes glowing with anticipation.</p><p>“As I told Aub Drewanchel, Rozemyne’s plans are her own.” In no weave would Ferdinand ever tell Justus what they were planning to do with that sap. Not before his starbind, at least. He forestalled any more questions by handing his nosy scholar a stack of paperwork to review.</p><p>That night, as he lay in bed, he stared down at the shumil sitting on his chest. With a sigh, he activated a small area sound-blocking tool and then sent mana into the doll’s feystone.</p><p>Nothing happened for several moments, but right before he moved to stop the signal, the feystone flashed.</p><p><em>Ferdinand?</em> Her voice was uncharacteristically weak.</p><p>“Good evening, Rozemyne.”</p><p>
<em>You didn’t come to dinner or call last night.</em>
</p><p>He sighed and said, “No, I did not. I spoke with Sylvester until late, and I’d had more vize than I normally consume.”</p><p>
<em>Wait, did you get drunk?!</em>
</p><p>“No, it would take far more than that to intoxicate me,” he replied with a scoff. His alcohol tolerance had always been high, which he suspected was a side effect of surviving so many poisonings. “However, I was not completely free from its effects, so I judged it best not to contact you.”</p><p>
<em>That was the only reason?</em>
</p><p>Raising a brow at the shumil, he said, “Yes. Why?”</p><p><em>Nothing,</em> she muttered. <em>I just…thought you might have decided to cut me off.</em></p><p>“Why would I ever do that?” he asked, flabbergasted. They had argued, but it had ended calmly enough. The last thing he’d said to her was an apology for his poor communication. He could not think of anything he’d said that would have indicated he’d written her off.</p><p><em>You don’t lecture people you’ve given up on,</em> she explained.</p><p>“Did we not already have that discussion?” he asked. “Why would I have lectured you afterwards? Furthermore, we already agreed to talk about the matter once I returned to Ehrenfest, no?”</p><p>
<em>Yeah…</em>
</p><p>He brought the shumil closer and let the worry he was feeling slip into his voice. “Rozemyne, you are the single most important existence to me, the person I’ve sworn my name to, and the one I will bind my stars with. Why would you ever think I would discard you?”</p><p>
<em>Well, I don’t think I ever saw you that angry before.</em>
</p><p>Heaving a sigh, he held the shumil against his forehead as he contemplated his next words. “I realized while speaking with Sylvester that I’ve been operating under some misguided notions. I will tell you more later in the hidden room. However, until then, can we agree not to pull stunts such as playing Ewigeliebe without talking about it first?”</p><p>
<em>Yes. I’m sorry.</em>
</p><p>He pressed the doll into his face for a brief moment before pulling it away and setting it on his chest. “I met with Aub Drewanchel. I’ve secured supply of both the new sweetener and gumka.”</p><p><em>Oh! Wonderful!</em> she exclaimed. <em>We can start making all sorts of [#%*^*] treats, then! And the gumka will prove infinitely useful. My revolution is at hand! Ehehehehe!</em></p><p>His brows shot up. “What revolution? Explain.”</p><p>She was silent for a moment before she said, <em>Well, it was used for so many things in the dream world.</em></p><p>She was hiding something, which was almost never good. “Rozemyne.”</p><p>
<em>Fine! Yes, I’m planning something, but it’s specifically for women. The moment it involves you, I will let you know.</em>
</p><p>Sighing again, he said, “As long as it doesn’t cause trouble.”</p><p>
<em>It won’t! Ehehehe!</em>
</p><p>Her disturbing giggles made him nervous, but he decided to drop it. If it truly only affected women, then he would likely never hear about it.</p><p>
<em>What are we giving in exchange?</em>
</p><p>When he told her the price of the syrup, she let out a long hum. <em>That’s actually not bad. Did you have to talk him down?</em></p><p>“Yes,” he said. “I told him I knew the process for making it and threatened to start growing the trees in climate-controlled research facilities in Alexandria. This was the price he agreed to charge to prevent that from happening.”</p><p>
<em>So it is the same as I remember? That’s good to know. We should be able to make sugar out of the syrup as well. It won’t taste the same as what was produced in Lanzenave, but it has its uses. What about the gumka?</em>
</p><p>“Two years of exclusivity on the lava cake recipe, as we discussed.”</p><p><em>Okay, good,</em> she said in a bright tone. <em>I’m going to debut cheesecake this year, and if things go to plan, sandwich cookies made with the new syrup next year.</em></p><p>“I haven’t tried this cheesecake,” he said, glaring at the shumil. “Do you mean to debut it without sharing it first with your aub?”</p><p>
<em>Hugo made his first successful one last week. I haven’t had time to share it with you. Why are you asking for some, though? Don’t you hate sweets?</em>
</p><p>“I don’t ‘hate’ them. I simply do not prefer sweet things. However, most of your creations are palatable, and the inclusion of cheese means it will be less sweet, no?”</p><p><em>Wow, you really know how to compliment someone,</em> she said in a sarcastic tone. <em>It’s still pretty sweet, but there is a bit of tang to balance it out. I’ll have some prepared after you return.</em></p><p>Ferdinand stared at the shumil in confusion. There were few sweets he could stomach eating, which she knew, as she’d just stated. Why, then, did she take offense to his saying her confections were among the very few he would consider eating?</p><p>He decided not to belabor the point and moved on. “I look forward to your invitation, then.”</p><p>There was a long stretch of silence. Had the doll’s feystone not been glowing, he would have assumed she’d cut the connection.</p><p>“Did you fall asleep, Rozemyne?” he asked.</p><p>
<em>No. I just got lost in thought.</em>
</p><p>Bracing himself to hear an outlandish idea, he asked, “What about?”</p><p>
<em>You seem…distant.</em>
</p><p>“Well, I am at the Royal Academy.”</p><p><em>Not like that!</em> she huffed, and he could picture her puffing out her cheeks in annoyance. <em>I mean that you’re talking to me differently, almost like when I was an apprentice blue shrine maiden. Are you trying to push me away?</em></p><p>He stared at the doll, dumbfounded. Reviewing the conversation, he saw that she was correct; he was speaking to her in a more formal tone. Was he subconsciously trying to gain some distance from her after their argument? It was true that part of his misunderstanding was rooted in a memory he’d rather forget, and he knew he would have to share it with her once they met in his hidden room. Just thinking about it, however, filled him with disgust and shame.</p><p>For years, he’d bury the memory any time it surfaced, thinking it dealt with. He hadn’t realized how it had affected his mindset. How much of Rozemyne’s failures with socializing in the past weave had been due to similar false beliefs he held?</p><p><em>Leave the past weave in the past,</em> he admonished himself. <em>What matters is how I’m communicating with this Rozemyne.</em></p><p>Perhaps he was seeking distance. He had confessed his greatest shame to her, after all. If he were to share it with anyone, it should have been with Sylvester or Karstedt, not the underaged girl who was the object of his inappropriate desires.</p><p>She should have been the one to distance herself after what he’d said. Truly, it was likely only a matter of time. Once she took stock of that conversation or shared its contents with her mothers, she would push him away.</p><p>Even the mere thought of it threatened to overwhelm him with anguish. It was far better to distance himself instead.</p><p><em>Ah, that’s it, then,</em> he realized. He had been trying to protect himself by beating her to the punch.</p><p>Swallowing his doubt and gathering his courage, he asked, “Do you not wish to push me away after what I said?”</p><p><em>Of course not!</em> she huffed. <em>You’re not the only one who swore their name, Ferdinand! Do you think you’re any less important to me than I am to you? When I swore my name, I was grateful because it meant I wouldn’t have to know the pain of losing you. I’ll never have to live a day without you.</em></p><p>Warmth bloomed in his chest at her words, and he could scarcely breathe for how full it was. Holding the shumil against his face, he took in her scent and committed her words to memory, writing them over his heart. He hadn’t lived long in a world without Rozemyne, but he would rather suffer through a thousand dinners with Veronica than relive even a moment of that misery. This Rozemyne, <em>his</em> Rozemyne, wouldn’t suffer him to live without her, so he would never have to know that pain again.</p><p>That she felt the same way left him speechless.</p><p><em>Why would you ever think I’d want to push you away just because you want me, too?</em> she asked, her tone indignant.</p><p>The warmth melted away, replaced by cold, sick dread. “You are in your summer. You were an adult in your previous life. Surely you understand the problem with an adult man looking upon a girl that way.”</p><p>
<em>Okay, first of all, I can’t be compared to other people my age. As you said, I have memories of being an adult, so I never saw people my age as peers. Second, I’m on the cusp of autumn, and I already look grown. No one even looked twice when I had my hair tied up. It’s understandable if you feel attracted to me. I mean, I am a beautiful woman in this life.</em>
</p><p>“Just because you are absolutely stunning does not give me leave to–” Rozemyne gasped, causing him to pause. “Are you well, Rozemyne?”</p><p><em>Oh, um, y-yes, I’m fine. It’s just…</em> She let out a muffled, undignified squeal as her bedding rustled violently in the background. Dead silence followed for a moment before she whispered, <em>”Absolutely stunning.” Ehehehe!</em></p><p>A smile pulled at Ferdinand’s lips for a heartbeat before the coldness returned.</p><p>Eventually, Rozemyne calmed down enough to ask, <em>Ferdinand, did you have those feelings about me when I was in my first year at the Academy?</em></p><p>“Of course not,” he scoffed.</p><p>
<em>They’ve only developed recently, then?</em>
</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>
<em>After I pretty much looked like an adult?</em>
</p><p>“…Yes.”</p><p><em>Well, there you go,</em> she said, her voice smug. <em>There’s nothing to feel guilty about. It’s not like you can keep those feelings in a box and only pull them out once I tie up my hair. Besides, you won’t even kiss me.</em></p><p>He sighed with exasperation as he pulled the shumil away from his face. “Of course I won’t!” he snapped. “Must I make a recording device that says, ‘You are in your summer,’ so I can replay it for you a dozen times a day?”</p><p><em>You know…</em> she said. <em>I’ll actually reach my autumn next season.</em></p><p>“Goodnight, Rozemyne.” With that, he turned off the shumil and ignored the flashing feystone. As he lay staring at his canopy, fear of what she might do once she physically reached autumn enveloped him.</p><p>It took a long time for him to enter Schlatraum’s realm.</p><p> </p><p>The morning of the next assembly, Ferdinand met with Lucius. It was oddly comforting to see another aub navigating the conference alone, even though Ferdinand wasn’t truly an aub yet.</p><p>They went through the poison checks, and then Lucius tried the fruit tart Ferdinand was serving.</p><p>“Oh, this is delectable!” Lucius said. “It has just the right amount of sweetness. Many of the items served in the Sovereignty were nothing more than lumps of sugar. It was your…Goddess of Light who created this, right?”</p><p>“Still unfamiliar with noble euphemisms, I see,” Ferdinand observed, “but yes, Rozemyne is the creator of this recipe. It’s available in the third volume of her cookbook. You can speak with Aub Ehrenfest if you wish to purchase it.”</p><p>“Ah, yes, I’ve heard about <em>Rozemyne’s Ravishing Recipes,</em>” he replied with an open smile. “I am most excited to get my hands on every volume in print. Little Letizia would love these tarts. I’m sure she’ll be delighted with the other recipes as well.”</p><p>Ferdinand sipped his tea. He would have preferred to have a conversation over gewinnen, but Lucius barely knew how to play, so there was no point in challenging him.</p><p>“How is Lady Rozemyne doing?” he asked. “I can only imagine the pressure she’s under after that last meeting with Zent Werdekraf.”</p><p>Keeping his face carefully blank, Ferdinand raised a hand to have Justus refresh the tea and erect the sound barrier. Lucius watched the proceedings with some confusion. He’d doubtless had similar encounters before, so he likely did not understand why the tea was being refreshed so early in the conversation.</p><p>“Aub Ahrensbach,” Ferdinand said.</p><p>“You can call me Lucius under a sound barrier.”</p><p>Staring him in the eye, Ferdinand said, “Aub Ahrensbach, you seem rather taken with my fiancée.”</p><p>Lucius’s brows furrowed as he titled his head in confusion. “Taken? How so?”</p><p>Was he really going to make him spell it out? Sighing, Ferdinand began listing off his offenses. “You complimented her ridiculous highbeast, you showed obvious excitement when speaking with her - even smiling openly at her, and you mentioned her thrice in less time than it takes to offer a proper greeting.”</p><p>The man had the audacity to snort and smile as though he were speaking with a petulant child. “I see why they call you the Ewigeliebe.”</p><p>“<em>An</em> Ewigeliebe,” Ferdinand corrected. “If you are going to insult me, at least do it correctly.”</p><p>“Fine, fine,” Lucius sighed. “First, let me state that I find it sad you openly insult your fiancée’s highbeast, especially when it’s as adorable as it is. It brings to mind some of the stuffed animals that were given to children in Lanzenave.”</p><p>“They would give them toys modeled after gruns?” Ferdinand asked, disgusted.</p><p>“No, there are no gruns there. There are, however, cute little animals with fluffy red fur who look much like Lady Rozemyne’s highbeast. Honestly, it makes me wonder if she’s been to Lanzenave to see them.”</p><p>“She hasn’t.”</p><p>Lucius shrugged. “Regardless, I called it cute because it was cute. As for showing excitement when speaking with her, of course I was excited. She’d just helped defend my duchy, brought back my kidnapped people, and was generally just a nice person. Would you rather I treat her with resentment?”</p><p>“I’d rather you stop letting your emotions show so openly,” Ferdinand said. Truly, it was disconcerting to see such an expressive face that so closely resembled his own.</p><p>“Right, right,” he sighed. “You’ll have to forgive my <em>lack of composure</em> the night my duchy was invaded.”</p><p>“Even now, you wear your emotions openly.”</p><p>“Yes, because you’re family,” he said nonchalantly. At Ferdinand’s glare, he shrugged again and said, “Deny it all you want, but our faces show the truth of the matter. You might as well accept it now since we’ll be fostering a close relationship. Since the future Aub Alexandria wishes to engage in joint construction of fast, safe roads to facilitate trade, we will continue to work together in the future. We will also share a border, and I will be regularly sending you feystones. Sending the empty ones back, by the way, would be appreciated.”</p><p>Ferdinand gave a brisk nod. “That will not be an issue.”</p><p>“I thank you ever so much,” Lucius said with a smile. “Now, as for mentioning Lady Rozemyne, is it not natural to bring up the creator of a trend in conversation? And I daresay she’s the topic at many a table here at the conference. But regardless, let me state plainly that I have no romantic interest in your fiancée. I do, however, hope to count her as a friend.”</p><p>“Alexandria will be a neutral duchy. We cannot take allies.”</p><p>“I don’t believe I used the word ‘ally,’” Lucius clapped back. “Now then, have I assuaged your jealousy?”</p><p>Ferdinand’s temper flared, but he hid it behind a slight narrowing of his eyes. “Jealousy?”</p><p>Leveling a flat look at Ferdinand, Lucius said, “You forewent social decorum to erect a sound barrier two heartbeats after the poison test just to admonish me for mentioning Lady Rozemyne three times, only one of which was referring to her directly by name.”</p><p>Ferdinand’s ears began to warm.</p><p>With a chuckle, Lucius leaned back in his chair and picked up his cup of tea. “Well, Dear Cousin, I must say my own jealousy has only been flamed. Would that I could experience the joys of such a passionate love.”</p><p>Ferdinand scoffed and took a long, slow sip of tea as he tried to calm his embarrassment. It rankled him that he couldn’t even deny the ridiculous statement.</p><p>“Unfortunately,” Lucius continued, “I shall be… Ah, binding my star next year to a woman I’ve yet to meet - the niece of the Zent no less. Truthfully, after seeing the knights the Zent sent to Ahrensbach as well as Lady Magdalena at that meeting, I worry that a Dunkelfelger woman may be too much for me to handle.”</p><p>“A legitimate concern to have,” Ferdinand agreed with a nod. “Dunkelfelger women are schemers by nature.”</p><p>“Schemers, you say?” Lucius murmured as he looked off into the distance. “How long, then, will it take to discover the truth about me and the transplanted Lanzenavians?”</p><p>“Is it not obvious that she will already know everything?” Ferdinand asked. “She is being sent to keep an eye on you, no?”</p><p>Lucius tilted his head and said, “Hmm… That might actually be for the best. Perhaps then her scheming can be focused on helping us increase our sugar production, improving conditions in Ahrensbach, and negotiating with our peers. Plus, I won’t have to worry about her actions causing me to go against the loyalty contract. If she acted as Lady Georgine did, my father and I would go up in flames.” He gave a shudder. “Magic is both wondrous and terrifying.”</p><p>Magic had always been a part of Ferdinand’s life, so he didn’t view it in such extremes. However, he recalled how amazed Rozemyne had been at the simple magic circle that he’d used to pour her jureve into the soaking tub, her shock at an ordonnanz flying through a window, and her astonishment over the circle at the noble’s gate. In many ways, speaking with Lucius was like speaking with a commoner with the Devouring. It was as though he embodied the previous weave’s Rozemyne. Perhaps the gods simply wanted Aub Ahrensbach to be that sort of odd person. It might have been what the duchy required in order to recover after everything it had been through.</p><p>“We should discuss this summer,” Ferdinand said. “Once the borderlines are redrawn, I will travel to Alexandria and claim the foundation.”</p><p>Lucius nodded. “We can coordinate to build gates between our duchies, and afterwards, I will send my father to act as a supplier.”</p><p>“You understand that the castle will not be constructed yet as the entwickeln will require a considerable amount of mana.”</p><p>“Where will you be staying?”</p><p>“The temple.”</p><p>“Ah,” Lucius said. “Then Father can stay there as well. It’s a large enough building that you should be able to have adequate space between you.” At Ferdinand’s raised brow, he chuckled and said, “Even with your blank expression, it’s easy to see you dislike him. I’m not sure what you hold against him, though. I’m aware of that place, but he was just as much at the mercy of it as you were.”</p><p>Ferdinand clicked his tongue and looked away. “The temple will be empty. He will need to provide everything he needs, including his furniture, personnel, and food.”</p><p>“Very well. You will need to interact with him some. He does not intend to move without your orders.”</p><p>It was unfortunate, but Ferdinand would not be able to avoid contact with Gervasio regardless. He would need to set him up as a supplier if nothing else, and he didn’t trust the man enough to leave him to his own devices. He would be too understaffed to dedicate Justus to watching Gervasio, so Ferdinand would have to check in on him regularly. Never before had he regretted having a small entourage so much.</p><p>“I won’t lie,” Lucius sighed. “It will be difficult supplying Ahrensbach without him, but at least I will still have my mother to help.”</p><p>Ferdinand froze as he tried to process those words. “Your mother came?”</p><p>Lucius nodded. “Just her. His other wife stayed behind, which was just as well. It was a political match.”</p><p>It stood to reason that if Gervasio had a love match, he would bring her. However, no one had made mention of the woman, so he’d assumed she’d either been left behind or climbed the towering staircase. If she had enough mana to conceive a child with Gervasio, then Ahrensbach wouldn’t be in the dire straits he’d previously thought. He’d planned for Rozemyne, Letizia, and himself to provide for the duchy alone in the previous weave, which they would have been able to do. With Ahrensbach losing as much land as it was, however, supplying enough mana to the foundation would be child’s play for two people with the amount of mana Lucius’s family had.</p><p>If Ferdinand had known, he might have ensured Gervasio had to fill feystones until he was nearly drained dry for years to come.</p><p>Regardless, he and Rozemyne would be able to provide for Alexandria, and she would have resented him for ruining her plan. Unlike Mestionora, he could see his pettiness would have cost him more than it was worth.</p><p>He was pulled from his thoughts by Lucius glancing over at his attendant. “Ah, it seems Dregarnuhr weaved swiftly today. Before I depart, however…” Sighing, he rubbed the back of his neck and said, “I hesitate to do this after earlier, but I have a gift I would like to present you. It is rather large, so I didn’t bring it with me.”</p><p>Ferdinand narrowed his eyes, wondering what could possibly be too large to bring to a meeting yet still be an appropriate gift.</p><p>“See, you’re already giving me a look, and I haven’t said anything yet. It’s a time-stopping magic tool filled with fresh fish. Lady Rozemyne seemed rather excited at the prospect of importing– Ah, that’s why I almost changed my mind about saying anything.”</p><p>With some effort, Ferdinand forced himself to relax his dark expression to his typical stoic mask. “How do you expect a man to react upon hearing another man has prepared a rather substantial gift for his fiancée?”</p><p>“It’s for the both of you,” he sighed. “Or do you mean to tell me the genius behind this tart was unable to develop mouth-watering recipes for seafood?”</p><p>“...She has.”</p><p>“Excellent. Then I hope you <em>both</em> enjoy the gift. I shall make arrangements to have it delivered here later.”</p><p>Watching Lucius depart, Ferdinand couldn’t help but feel he lost to him somehow.</p><p>With some resignation, he realized he would have to prepare an equally ridiculous gift in return. Otherwise, Rozemyne would certainly do so, and he didn’t want her giving that man anything.</p>

<h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
<p>As Ferdinand sat alone with his small entourage, he desperately wished the seat next to him provided a source of warmth, comfort, and companionship rather than the cold emptiness it delivered. He shouldn’t have wasted time or energy entertaining such childish notions. After all, Rozemyne had special permission to accompany him starting next year. This would be the only time he would attend alone. Even so, he couldn’t quite manage to shove the loneliness down.</p><p>Fortunately, he didn’t have too long to stew in his misery. Zent Werdekraf, escorting Queen Sieglinde, entered, followed by their entourages. Lord Trauerqual was among them, but by his side was Lady Magdalena. Ferdinand glanced over to Eglantine and Anastasius. The latter sighed and waved dismissively while the former laid a hand over her heart. It seemed the former first queen could not handle the social pressures of noble society after her loss, meaning that “show of respect” at the first assembly had actually been her reaching her breaking point. That made two of Trauerqual’s wives who’d stepped away from society because of the loss of a child. Hopefully, there wouldn’t be a third.</p><p>Once everyone was seated, Werdekraf took the stage and offered the standard greeting before immediately launching into an explanation about the Grutrissheit and Zent selection. “We have all seen the importance of prayer and offering mana to the gods, especially as it relates to divine protections,” he said. “What you may not know is that the quality of your schtappe it dependent upon those protections. In order to obtain the Book of Mestionora, you must have the protections of all seven pillar gods <em>before</em> you acquire your schtappe.”</p><p>A stir ran through the audience, and Ferdinand caught several voices counting how many people in the entire country would be able to acquire their Wisdom. Many glanced his way, and some looked towards Ehrenfest. Sylvester’s face paled a little at the attention, but he kept his expression neutral, though he was likely lamenting that all of his children had turned into gremlins.</p><p>“It is fortunate, then, that schtappe acquisition has already been moved to fourth year since all archdukes used to hold their Wisdom. Those whose duchies had a country border gate would help supply the country foundation through it as well. This is a practice we will return to within the next two generations. Four duchies have already acquired the means to achieve this in less than ten years - Alexandria, Corinzdaum, Ehrenfest, and Ahrensbach.”</p><p>Eglantine smiled politely as was her custom, and Lucius had a proud smirk. Sylvester, however, turned alabaster. The Zent had just ordered him to retire by the time Charlotte reached twenty-three years of age, which was exceedingly young for an aub. However, given that Lucius was only twenty-one, Eglantine nineteen, Lestilaut seventeen, and Rozemyne would ostensibly be fifteen when she became Aub, no one could offer any complaints. If anything, they were setting the trend for the next generation of aubs to be impractically young. Then again, Ferdinand had one set up Rozemyne to be the first underaged aub in history, so he had no room to talk.</p><p>The piercing gazes turned back to the Zent as he explained the new process for archduke candidates receiving their schtappes. It was as he had stated at the meeting the night of Lanzenave’s invasion. If they did not obtain all seven pillar gods’ protections, they could postpone obtaining their schtappe as they dedicated themselves to prayer, even being allowed to come back to the Academy in the off season or attend after their sixth year if necessary. It was at this point he revealed the existence of the shrines. At the Zent’s signal, a pair of attendants carried a large white sheet hanging from a frame onto the stage. Werdekraf then used a projecting magic tool that he’d likely borrowed from Hirschur to display a map of the shrines dotted across the Academy grounds. It matched what was in the Grutrissheit, though there were marks to indicate the shrines that would be restored before the next academic term. “A copy of this map will be distributed to all aubs at the final assembly where we will perform a Dedication Ritual.” Undoubtedly, it would be stamped with the Rozemyne Workshop sigil on the back since it was likely produced in the orphanage in Dunkelfelger.</p><p>“The importance of religious ceremonies and prayer have been stated and exemplified. As such, my next decree will be of no surprise. The temple in each duchy will be cleaned out and returned to its original purpose. Ehrenfest led the charge in this and helped Dunkelfelger do the same. As a result, many of the Dunkelfelgarian knights are now able to summon divine instruments, just as the incarnation of Mestionora and her siblings do. Behold!” He brought forth his schtappe and transformed it into Leidenschaft’s spear, fully charged and sparking with blue mana.</p><p>Several aubs gasped, their only experience seeing a divine instrument being when the Ehrenfest archduke candidates summoned Schutzaria’s shield during the ternnisbefallen attack. Despite the pockets of shock, a pall had fallen over the audience in general. Regardless of the justification, almost no one would step foot inside the temple by choice. They would also no longer be able to use it as a place to dispose of undesirables who were unable to become nobles. Surely most had come to the conclusion that following the Zent’s order would entail installing schtappe-wielding nobles to positions of power within the temple, an assignment that would feel degrading no matter what their aub said.</p><p>Drawing everyone’s attention away from their new misery, Zent Werdekraf went on to detail the new selection process for the Zent, emphasizing that the gods would select the next ruler, not blood or politics. This, of course, started a round of muttered speculation about who the next Zent might be and how to secure the role for someone from their own duchy.</p><p>“At the final assembly,” Zent Werdekraf called over the noise, “I shall reveal the exact path to the Grutrissheit.” He then offered the standard farewell before escorting his wife from the room, ignoring the shouted questions and cries of shock. Truthfully, Ferdinand didn’t know where they found the energy to be continuously surprised. If he had come to this conference blind, he would have stopped reacting by the third foundation-altering announcement and simply silently absorbed the rest to be processed later. That affected nonchalance might have been because he’d grown used to Rozemyne’s antics, however.</p><p>When they returned to the dorms, Sylvester let out a long sigh. “The next couple of days are going to be terrible,” he complained. “Not that the past few have been all that great.”</p><p>“We knew this was coming,” Florencia said.</p><p>“Doesn’t make it any more fun to deal with.”</p><p>Ferdinand snorted. “When has the Archduke Conference ever been fun for you?”</p><p>“You know what?” Sylvester said. “I’m going to go to my room and enjoy an entire bottle of my best vize while I contemplate my early retirement.” With that, he gave them a brisk nod and marched up the stairs.</p><p>Florencia sighed and held a hand to her cheek. “That part was somewhat unexpected, but it’s not as though he’ll be stepping away from the role entirely. Given the circumstances of his own ascension, however, I understand why he feels this way.”</p><p>Their father’s worsening health and sudden climb up the towering staircase when Sylvester was still so young had truncated the usual handoff, making a difficult process that much harder. Being told to make his daughter take the role at roughly the same age he had was likely causing him some unexpected grief.</p><p>“I’ll go check on him,” Ferdinand said, earning him a grateful smile from his sister-in-law.</p><p>When Ferdinand entered the room, he found Sylvester sitting at his table with a goblet in one hand, a bottle in the other, and his unfocused gaze cast out the window across the verdant grounds. Ferdinand said nothing as he grabbed another glass and sat across from him.</p><p>After a long moment, Sylvester filled both vessels and then started to slowly sip his, still staring out the window. Ferdinand was halfway through his glass before his brother spoke. “He was supposed to introduce me to the other aubs and help me form alliances. We just kept putting it off, though, because I was so young and there was always more time. Until there wasn’t.” He took a long draft of his vize and then held the rim of the glass against his forehead as he sighed. “It was Father’s decision to remain neutral, and then we suddenly found ourselves in the upper-middle rankings through no merit of our own. I was left to navigate through the aftermath without his guidance, even though it was his decision that put us in that hated position.”</p><p>Ferdinand nodded. He’d moved to the temple by then and thus hadn’t witnessed Sylvester’s struggles at the time. Bonifatius had been there to offer his support, but there was only so much the man could do as the brother of the former aub. He hadn’t been privy to the inner workings of his little brother’s mind.</p><p>“There wasn’t even a real transition period. Just one day he was too sick to do the work, so I had to step up, and then he was…gone. I know it’ll be different with Charlotte and that she’s already been training to become the next Aub Ehrenfest, but having to cede the seat to her while she’s still so young feels like I’m setting her up to be the failure of an aub that I was.”</p><p>“You weren’t a failure, Sylvester,” Ferdinand said.</p><p>He scoffed and shook his head. “Says the man who had to leave his position as knight commander because I let Mother’s abuse continue. Gods, I’m so sorry about that, Ferdinand. I should have—“</p><p>“Stop,” Ferdinand said, holding up a hand. “You have already offered apologies, and I have no need for more. You did not come here to reminisce about my past, no?”</p><p>Sylvester shoved both hands into his hair as he rested his elbows against the table. After several moments, he said, “I can’t believe I’m complaining about this when you’re about to go into a new duchy alone.”</p><p>“We are not here to discuss my situation,” Ferdinand said. “We can complain about that over drinks at a different time.”</p><p>“But—“</p><p>He sighed. “I will not be alone. Rozemyne will be coming with me and garnering the support of the younger generation. I and both of our retinues are familiar with the work of an aub as well, so I will be well-positioned in that regard.”</p><p>Sylvester rested the side of his head against his hand as he looked back out the window, his eyes glassy. “I wish you didn’t have to go. Still, I know if anyone can handle it, it’s you two.” Sighing, he turned back to Ferdinand and said, “Well, Charlotte won’t be alone, either. We received the Zent’s approval this morning for her engagement to Alaric. They’ll bind their stars once he graduates. That should give him enough time to acclimate to Ehrenfest before he has to take over Florencia’s duties.”</p><p>Ferdinand’s stomach fell as he realized that he, too, would have to take on First Wife duties after his starbind. Perhaps he should seek out training with Elvira and Florencia in the autumn while he still had the chance. Setting that to the back of his mind, he asked his older brother, “What of Wilfried?’</p><p>“He’ll have his starbind with Brunhilde after he graduates, same time that you and Rozemyne do, and he’ll have the one with Hannelore once they turn nineteen since Brunhilde should have weaned their first child by then so there won’t be any issues with the two of them mixing mana.”</p><p>“Will Brunhilde still become Giebe Groschel?”</p><p>Sylvester shook his head, his lips pulling into a regretful line. “There was a lot of backlash after Wilfried got engaged to a woman from an upper-ranking duchy.”</p><p>That was to be expected. They feared a return of Gabrielle more than any other province.</p><p>“Even so, she’s still marrying into the archducal family, so her mother’s position won’t suffer. Berthilde is working to take on the role, though. If she proves as exceptional as her older sister, then I think she has a fair shot of beating out her little brother.”</p><p>Tapping the side of his head, Ferdinand said, “So they will need a place to live sooner rather than later.” At Sylvester’s nod, he said, “If you wouldn’t mind, I would like to offer Wilfried my estate when I leave.”</p><p>Sylvester’s jaw dropped.</p><p>“It is next to the castle, so it’s suitable for the knight commander. There is also a side building for Brunhilde to occupy.”</p><p>“But… Didn’t Father give you that estate?” Sylvester asked.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>“And… you would give it to Wilfried?”</p><p>He nodded again.</p><p>Letting out a long sigh, Sylvester slumped back in his chair and stared at the ceiling. Eventually, he said, “It wouldn’t bother me at all. If anything, I… I can’t put into words how grateful I am.” His voice caught on the last word, and he had to pause to swallow. “To think not that long ago you were telling me to disown him, and now…” He cleared his throat and said, “You’ve both come a long way, you know.”</p><p>Ferdinand thought back to the hopeless brat the boy had been and compared him to the man he was becoming. He maintained his best characteristics, and while he had not completely overcome his worst, he was surrounded by the right people to help him stay on the right path. Ferdinand was startled to realize he’d grown fond of the boy and would actually miss training him.</p><p>“You know,” Sylvester said, cutting into his thoughts, “I was worried at first when we decided to have you and Rozemyne get engaged and she mentioned wanting children. You’d always been so harsh, but she really softened those sharp edges of yours. You’ll be a good father if how you treat my kids is anything to go by.”</p><p>Ferdinand nearly spit out his drink, causing Sylvester to burst into laughter. “Fool!” he snapped. “Have you forgotten how you banned me from being anywhere near your children?”</p><p>“Of course not,” Sylvester snorted, “and that was a mistake. Who knows? Had you been more active in Wilfried’s life, he might not have ever gone to the White Tower. That’s beside the point, though. All of my kids respect you, not just the one you’re engaged to, even if you are out-of-standard.”</p><p>“I believe that moniker belongs to Rozemyne.”</p><p>“It belongs to both of you,” Sylvester corrected. “Need I remind you that you put a zent on the throne in the course of a single night? Or that your idea of problem solving is to throw more mana at it? Or—“</p><p>“I grasp your point,” Ferdinand said, the corners of his mouth twitching downward. “However, as I stated before, the Zent was to save Rozemyne, and I typically make magic tools for personal use, so if it’s more efficient to use more mana, then that is what I will do.”</p><p>“Alright,” Sylvester snorted, “then what about that time you got your own Wisdom?”</p><p>From there, the two spent a bell or so sharing drinks as they reminisced.</p><p> </p><p>“My Lord,” Justus said as Ferdinand was climbing into bed, “before I give you the shumil, there is something I feel I must say.”</p><p>Ferdinand raised a brow at him, taken aback for a moment by the obvious pain in the man’s eyes. “What is it?”</p><p>He grimaced for a moment before he closed his eyes and bowed his head. “I must apologize to you. Because of my neglect of your gentlemen’s education, you had an unnecessary argument with your all goddess, and you suffered undue mental anguish.”</p><p>“Whatever do you mean?” Ferdinand asked, perplexed. “What transpired was not a result of any failing on your part.”</p><p>“But it was, my lord,” he insisted. “I don’t believe you would have gotten as upset as you did if it weren’t for what Gertrude said to you during your fourth year at the Academy about those magic tool anklets you made. Had I addressed it with you at the time rather than telling you to put it out of your mind, you might not have developed the ideas that led you to look at your all goddess with such repulsion.”</p><p>“Repulsion…?” Ferdinand repeated, his eyes slowly widening with new-found horror. While he was certain no one else would have been able to read his expression, Rozemyne would have, and if she’d seen him regard her in such a way… It was no wonder she was convinced he’d cast her to the side after he failed to come to dinner or contact her that night. Shaking his head, he said, “Justus, I have no intention of placing the blame for my actions on your shoulders. Besides, you…” He swallowed, forcing the next words past his lips. “You were not responsible for my gentlemen’s education.”</p><p>Silence hung between them as the implication of his words turned it leaden. Had he ever admitted any of his father’s faults out loud? Nearly twenty years he had lived since the man’s death, and only now was he able to face the fact that his father had failed him in any way. It was such a slippery slope that he’d subconsciously avoided it his entire life. After all, his father had saved him from Adalgisa and accepted him despite being a bastard that had driven his wife to show open defiance to him. Aside from Sylvester, Ferdinand believed his father was the only one in Ehrenfest who loved him like family, until that fateful day Rozemyne declared she’d make enemies of the entire country if necessary for him.</p><p>He looked down at his open palms as he remembered his father holding his hand out to him, pulling him close, and telling him he was proud of him. Then, he remembered collapsing in the supply chamber on the verge of mana exhaustion as Veronica laughed, vomiting halfway through his meals, dodging assassins, fleeing from poisonous flowers veiled in the promise of deadly winter, and asked himself what his father did during those times. Rihyarda had intervened, and his father had spoken to Veronica, but to no avail.</p><p>His mind conjured a picture of the young Myne, her eyes aglow as he sat her in his lap and read the bible to her. Her dark hair, though, was as light as his, as were her eyes, and when she looked up at him, her face held all the trust that the blue apprentice shrine maiden had when she reached out to him from within the branches of a trombe or when she wrapped her arms around him after waking from having her memories read. Rozemyne’s voice echoed in his memory as he imagined staring at the light-haired little girl.</p><p>
<em>Your father should have stood up for you!</em>
</p><p>If someone who hated that little girl wanted to force her to swear her name, would he take her name instead, or would he shield her instead?</p><p>Was that even a question?</p><p>
<em>You’ll protect ours, though, right?</em>
</p><p>He clenched his hands into fists. He loved his father, but the man had been far from perfect. Ferdinand would do better. He would be like Gunther and keep his promise to Rozemyne to protect their children. He couldn’t be a good father, but he could at least do that much.</p><p>Eventually, he looked back to Justus and said, “Do not blame yourself, Justus. Sylvester has promised to correct my misunderstandings and ensure I am properly educated before my starbind.”</p><p>“The Aub?”</p><p>He nodded. “Now, if that is all.”</p><p>Justus looked at the hand his master held out and then gave a warm, defeated smile. “Of course, my lord.” He handed over the shumil, wished him Schlaftraum’s blessings, and left.</p><p>Ferdinand could well understand where Justus was coming from. However, there was no need for his retainer to feel as though he needed to correct a mistake he never made, and by rights Sylvester would be the one to address the error since their father had already reached the distant heights.</p><p>Setting that aside, he activated the sound-blocking tool, placed his finger against the shumil’s feystone, and waited a few moments before Rozemyne answered.</p><p><em>Good evening, Ferdinand,</em> her sweet voice called.</p><p>“Good evening, Rozemyne,” he replied, letting himself smile. “How was your day?”</p><p><em>We got a lot done,</em> she replied. <em>I met with our downtown associates, and the Italian Restaurant has officially named Liese’s replacement, so she’ll be training them for the next year until she comes to Alexandria in the spring. The Othmar Company has also taken on a handful of other chefs to train to send along with her, and the cost was actually more reasonable than I’d predicted. The new furniture you ordered won’t be ready for summer, but they were already working on a mattress for you, so that should be done within the next couple of weeks.</em></p><p>He heard the question in her voice, but he chose to ignore it in order to avoid the lecture he’d earn by explaining it was for his hidden room. “Very well,” he acknowledged. “I will simply have to bring the furniture from my estate while I stay at the temple in Alexandria. When I get back, we’ll finalize the blueprints for the castle, library, and various research facilities. Also, once we return and you no longer have to fill in for Sylvester and Florencia, you and I will need to stop supplying the Ehrenfest foundation and start storing mana for Alexandria.”</p><p><em>I figured as much,</em> she said. <em>The first draft of the first volume of the picture books we’re making about the history of the royal family is complete. Once Roderick finishes looking it over, we’ll send it to Zent Werdekraf’s scholars to review. As for the one for the aubs, we’re having different print shops print different chapters, and then we’ll have them all bound together at the same time. I’m impressed the Zent’s scholars were able to write it so fast.</em></p><p>“That is the skill it takes to serve the Zent,” Ferdinand said with a shrug.</p><p>
<em>Anyway, that’s about all I have to report. What’s going on there?</em>
</p><p>Lying back, he held the shumil above him as he said, “I met with Aub Ahrensbach this morning.”</p><p>
<em>Really? How is he?</em>
</p><p>“As annoying as I always suspected he would be,” Ferdinand groused. He recounted most of the meeting, leaving out the accusation of jealousy, but stopped when she snorted with barely-controlled laughter. “And what do you find so amusing?” he asked.</p><p>After several false starts, she finally said, <em>You’re complaining, but it sounds like you had fun.</em></p><p>“I certainly did not.”</p><p>
<em>Mmm… Okay, Ferdie.</em>
</p><p>His eyes nearly bulged as he sat up in bed. “Who permitted you to shorten my name in such a manner?”</p><p><em>Oh! Sorry! It just slipped out.</em> After some pointed questioning, she finally admitted, <em>It’s what I call you in my head when I think you’re being adorable…</em></p><p>Raising his brow, he said, “I see. Oh, he also mentioned that he would be giving us a time-stopping magic tool full of fish. Unfortunately, as we will need to store every scrap of mana we can, neither of us will be able to dedicate any to its upkeep, so I must refuse the gift.”</p><p><em>YOU CAN’T!</em> she gasped. <em>Ferdinand! You wouldn’t do that to me, would you?! Not my fish! Please! Anything but my fish!! It was just a pet name!</em></p><p>“I am not a pet,” he said, glaring at the doll.</p><p><em>No, not like that!</em> she insisted. <em>In the dream world, lovers would call each other by a special name that no one else could.</em></p><p>If that were the case, he supposed he could live with it, so long as it remained private. Ferdinand settled back against his pillow and said, “I suppose if you agree to have its contents prepared within two weeks of my return and to never use that name in the presence of others, I could be persuaded to accept the gift.”</p><p><em>Oh?</em> she asked, her voice lilting in a teasing tone. <em>I can be sure to have several delectable meals prepared for us, my dear Ferdie.</em></p><p>The way she purred the pet name sent a shiver down his spine as it kindled the embers of Brenwarmme’s heat. What a dangerous game she’d just introduced, but he could play it just as well, and it was his move. Dropping his voice to the octave she preferred, he murmured directly into the shumil’s feystone, “I look forward to sharing them with you, my lovely Myne.”</p><p>The squeal that followed nearly pierced his eardrums, and he instinctively thrust the shumil to arm’s length as he covered his ear with his free hand and winced. It was several moments before she could form coherent sentences. <em>That’s cheating, Ferdinand!</em> she yelled.</p><p>“I merely returned what you gave,” he said, his head still ringing.</p><p>
<em>Uh, no! I joked around a little. You turned into the Lord of Winter and tried to summon a blizzard!</em>
</p><p>A wave of guilt washed over him after the fight they’d recently had. He’d falsely accused her of being lewd, and here he was purposely setting her aflame. Of course, he’d only meant to fluster her a little, but intentions mattered little in the face of outcomes. Sighing, he shoved the shame down and instead filed away the information he’d just obtained to use in two years. “Shall I summon Flutrane to wash away those winter thoughts?” he asked, considering a couple of topics that would surely do the trick.</p><p><em>Oh, you summoned Flutrane’s waters, alright,</em> she muttered, likely thinking he hadn’t heard her.</p><p>He narrowed his eyes in confusion. Hadn’t she just said Brenwarmme’s heat had been ignited in her? Why, then, did she claim he’d simultaneously extinguished them?</p><p>Well, it wasn’t the first incomprehensible thing she’d ever said. Regardless, since she wasn’t in need of his assistance in straying out of frosty thoughts, he wished her Schlatraum’s blessings and rested the shumil against his chest. “Two years… Might as well be a hundred,” he sighed, closing his eyes as his treacherous brain replayed Rozemyne purring his pet name over and over until he at last grabbed his handkerchief from his bedside and poured mana into the embroidered magic circle, calling Schlaftraum’s blessing on himself.</p>

<p>The next meeting Ferdinand had scheduled was with the new Aub Corinzdaum. He understood it was necessary, but he wasn’t looking forward to that Ewigeliebe prince glaring at him for an entire bell for having the audacity to breathe in the vicinity of his Geduldh.</p><p>Like Alexandria, Corinzdaum had no dormitory yet. While Zent Werdekraf was allowing the royal family to stay in one of the villas, they were unable to host anyone there. Instead, the new Aub and her soon-to-be consort would come to Ehrenfest’s tea party room. When they arrived, they offered the standard greeting, which filled Ferdinand with a sense of wrongness. Even though Rozemyne had held Eglantine’s name in the past weave, he’d still had to treat her and her husband as royals. Seeing them as an aub couple in a duchy ranked lower than his gave him mental vertigo.</p><p>Their attendants served the treats, and both Eglantine’s and Anastasius’s eyes lit up when the cream puffs were placed on their plates, just as Justus predicted. They in turn had brought a type of cookie that had been in the first volume of <em>Rozemyne’s Ravishing Recipes,</em> and while it was a far sight better than traditional Sovereignty fair, it was still too sweet for Ferdinand. He managed to eat one, though, for the sake of politeness.</p><p>“How fairs Ehrenfest after the battle?” Eglantine asked.</p><p>“Well enough,” Ferdinand replied. “We suffered little.”</p><p>Anastasius sniffed. “Unsurprising. Tell me, how is Rozemyne?”</p><p>It seemed the fool had forgotten he was no longer a prince and now ranked below Ferdinand. Eglantine, however, had not, and she cleared her throat and glared at her fiancé. Sighing, he said, “Forgive me. How is Lady Rozemyne?”</p><p>“She is doing well,” he replied. “She is making preparations for our upcoming departure as we speak.”</p><p>“Hm. I’m glad to hear it.”</p><p>“Yes,” Eglantine said. “Oh, I hear congratulations are in order. Your niece is engaged to an archduke candidate from Drewanchel, yes?” Her smile was genuinely happy, likely because Charlotte had been one of her last students. Going forward, someone else would be teaching the archduke candidate course as she would have to attend the duties of aub.</p><p>Ferdinand studied Anastasius from the corner of his eye, but he didn’t seem to care that his fiancée was smiling at another man. Rather, he seemed to be more interested in both the conversation and the cream puff that was steadily disappearing from his plate.</p><p>“Indeed,” he answered. “Charlotte has been meeting with Alaric for some time now. I believe they’ve become rivals at gewinnen.”</p><p>Anastasius nodded. “As the future Aub Ehrenfest, she will undoubtedly find herself in more than one match if she wishes to socialize as most aubs do.” Turning to his wife, he said, “You might want to learn to play yourself, Eglantine. Perhaps you can learn alongside Rozemyne, assuming she is also a beginner since her aubhood was only just announced.”</p><p>Ferdinand nearly raised his eyebrows in surprise. In the past weave, Rozemyne had described Anastasius as being so jealous he tried to prevent Eglantine from meeting even with other women without him. It seemed having a chance to grow at least somewhat separated from her had improved his behavior significantly.</p><p>“Rozemyne is indeed a novice,” Ferdinand agreed. “I shall have to start training her.”</p><p>That made Anastasius frown. “Is it not a bit cruel to pit her against the Lord of Evil?”</p><p>Little did he know that once upon a time, Rozemyne went all out against Ferdinand in a brand new game in order to seize victory. Turnabout was fair play. “Was it not my tutelage that allowed all three Ehrenfest archduke candidates to receive first in class? I believe I can handle explaining the rules of a game.”</p><p>“Then I look forward to playing with her at the next Archduke Conference,” Eglantine said. “I shall have Anastasius teach me before then.”</p><p>“Hmm… A battle of disciples, then. I accept,” Ferdinand said with a smile, causing Anastasius to grimace and Eglantine to gulp.</p><p>Soon after that, Ferdinand called for the tea to be refreshed, and Janrik activated the sound-blocking barrier. Everyone inside sat up straighter, and Ferdinand asked, “When are you planning to move to your new duchy?”</p><p>“We will begin the process this summer,” Eglantine said, “and plan to be finished by the end of fall. I will be there most of the time starting late summer, though.”</p><p>“As I will be High Bishop, I will go around the same time, but as I will be staying in the temple until our starbind, I will be there permanently starting from late summer,” Anastasius added.</p><p>Ferdinand nodded. “Very well. We shall plan to set up the border gates in late fall, then. Have you finally gotten your Wisdom?”</p><p>Eglantine’s mouth pulled into a tight line as Anastasius frowned at him. Their reactions didn’t cow him in the slightest; it was her own fault for taking so long to obtain the Grutrissheit. “Yes,” she said, “now that the obstacles that were keeping me from it have been removed.”</p><p>Ferdinand raised a brow at her, and she sighed. “There was no end to the harassment from Sigiswald’s retainers, and unfortunately, one of my attendants was a spy who passed along whenever I planned to step foot outside the second queen’s palace. That is all I wish to say on the matter.”</p><p>There were at least half a dozen ways Ferdinand could devise the moment she stated the problem to circumvent it, but he decided to let it go. Everything had worked out for the best with Zent Werdekraf who could easily be plied with ditter stakes. Eglantine without a namestone was less reliable.</p><p>“When will you and Lady Rozemyne move?” Anastasius asked, obviously trying to change the subject.</p><p>Ferdinand allowed it. “I will go this summer to dye the foundation and keep an eye on Gervasio before returning to Ehrenfest in the fall. Rozemyne and I will then move to Alexandria before winter starts.”</p><p>“When do you plan to move the priests?” Eglantine asked. “Since we’ll be splitting those from the Sovereignty, I thought it would be easier if we had ours come to Corinzdaum at the same time.”</p><p>“After we move in the winter before the Dedication Ritual.”</p><p>“Won’t that be difficult for the priests?” Anastasius asked.</p><p>Ferdinand shook his head. “Rozemyne will come back from the Academy and use her highbeast to move them. We also have to have them for the Dedication Ritual, but I refuse to have them enter Alexandria’s temple without the Aub or High Bishop present to protect and monitor them.”</p><p>Sighing, Eglantine placed a hand on her cheek and said, “Very well, then. I’m afraid that since I don’t have the same type of highbeast as Lady Rozemyne, we will have to move our priests sooner. It may cause some issues, but not nearly as many as having them travel through winter.”</p><p>“As for the other matter,” Anastasius said, “we have had the print shops and paper-making facilities from the Sovereignty investigated, and they are all of comparable quality. Since the part you are gaining has most of the paper-making and we have the majority of the print shops, I suggest we send three of the print shops to you and you send four of the paper-making facilities to us. We plan to have the ones who live closest to the border move.”</p><p>The state of both industries was confirmed by Justus, so Ferdinand had no qualms going forward. “Very well. I shall do the same on our end.”</p><p>After some vague promises to meet again at the next conference once they held their duchies, the meeting came to an end, and Anastasius escorted Eglantine out of the tea party room.</p><p>As they left, Ferdinand sat back and considered his soon-to-be neighbors. Anastasius, like Wilfried, had changed to the point of nearly being unrecognizable. Even the way he escorted Eglantine was different; he maintained a socially acceptable distance and kept his eyes forward rather than on her. The permanent scowl had also disappeared, despite having suffered worse hardships. Had Sigiswald survived and the truth of Rozemyne’s Wisdom been revealed to Anastasius, this version of him likely would not have pushed for the two to marry. The fact he had been shielding Hildebrand from his older brother was proof enough. Ferdinand far preferred this weave’s iteration.</p><p>After reviewing the contents of the conversation with Justus, Ferdinand left to allow Janrik to clear away the vestiges of tea and prepare for his next meeting that afternoon. In the meantime, he went to his room and studied magic circles in the Grutrissheit until Justus came to fetch him.</p><p>Not too long after Ferdinand settled himself in the tea party room, Aub Frenbeltag and Constanze arrived, offering greetings and going through poison checks. Once again, Ferdinand was offering cream puffs while they provided a more traditional sweet that, unsurprisingly, wasn’t very palatable compared to Rozemyne’s delicacies.</p><p>It had been a long time since Ferdinand had seen his older sister. Thankfully, she took after their father, so he didn’t have to fight the nausea that always crept up around certain other members of the family. While Rozemyne had taken exception to the two using their status as older siblings to wrest mana from Ehrenfest, Ferdinand accepted it as a matter of course. They needed the resource and found a way to obtain it. It was as simple as that.</p><p>He didn’t have many memories of his sister as she had done everything in her power to fade into the background and then married out to a higher ranking duchy as soon as possible. Other than the few family dinners they were both present for in his younger days, they had little interaction. Still, he had nothing objectively negative to say about her, which was a far sight better than he could say for others in the Ehrenfest bloodline.</p><p>“Aub Alexandria,” Aub Frenbeltag said, “it is good to see you well. I had worried that the stress of the incident after graduation as well as the sudden ascension to your new position had affected your health.”</p><p>Keeping a social smile carefully in place, Ferdinand replied, “I thank you, but there is no need for concern.”</p><p>“I’m ever so glad to hear it,” Constanze said. “How have you been since leaving the temple?”</p><p>“I have been focused on performing my duties as knight commander, though my attention has turned elsewhere as of last week. I was fortunate that Rozemyne had a competent retainer who could take over my old duties and assist her in my place as she acted as High Bishop.”</p><p>Smiling just as politely, the aub said, “Ehrenfest’s archduke candidates are certainly busy between their normal duties, serving in the temple, and in Lady Rozemyne’s case, doing scholar work.”</p><p>“Oh, yes, our brother showed us the most beautiful charm, saying she made it. Did she give you one as well?”</p><p>“Indeed,” he replied, touching the courtship necklace he still wore above his robes.</p><p>“Oh, is that the only charm she’s given you?” Aub Frenbeltag asked.</p><p>Ferdinand’s smile brightened, but he didn’t reply. Their smirks, however, said they didn’t take his silence as assent.</p><p>“It must be difficult trying to ensure the safety of the incarnation of a goddess so prone to fall into danger,” the aub said. “Did she brew the protective charms she made as part of her scholar training?”</p><p>“In part,” Ferdinand said. “How fairs Frenbeltag?”</p><p>“Much better now that the archducal family is involved in religious ceremonies,” Constanze said. “We hope Rudiger will obtain more divine protections for his contributions.”</p><p>“He undoubtedly will.” With that, Ferdinand had the tea refreshed so they could settle their business and be done with it.</p><p>At Ferdinand’s invitation, the aub brought forward his most pressing concern - bringing the printing and paper-making industry to Frenbeltag. Unfortunately for him, Alexandria was neutral, so Ferdinand had to discard family ties when making such decisions. “My apologies, but that is a conversation that will have to wait until Rozemyne is present as she leads those industries. It will be at least two years before we are able to make such decisions regardless as we will barely have a season to take stock of the state of the duchy and finish settling matters with printing and paper-making with Corinzdaum and Drewanchel.”</p><p>“I see,” Constanze said, a little disappointed. “Do you plan to expand into Ahrensbach first? We didn’t speak much growing up, but perhaps your connection is stronger with their aub?”</p><p>Ferdinand’s smile brightened even more. Constanze’s attack was twofold. First, since neither he nor Lucius had said a word about their connection, she sought to confirm if the two of them shared blood ties, and if so, what they were. Second, she implied that if he did the sensible thing and expanded into Ahrensbach before Frenbeltag, he would be forgoing neutrality to show family-based favoritism despite the fact that she was asking him to do that very thing. It also served as an attempt to guilt him into capitulating to their request.</p><p>How annoying. They’d likely employed similar tactics when convincing Sylvester to fill their chalices during the Dedication Ritual. “We have no plans currently to expand into any other duchies,” Ferdinand said. “As I said before, we will be focused on establishing Alexandria for at least two years, likely more as that will be when Rozemyne takes the seat of Aub, so we will need to work on stabilizing her rule for some time after that.”</p><p>In other words, her provocation had just moved her further down the list. Her and her husband’s expressions revealed they understood the position they were now in.</p><p>After making plans to contact each other once Ferdinand was ready to create the border gates between their duchies, they beat a hasty retreat.</p><p>His next two meetings were with Aubs Neuehausen and Berschmann. The former had maintained the trade routes between Dunkelfelger and the Sovereignty, but now that Alexandria both held the land those trade routes connected to and bordered Dunkelfelger, their duchy’s importance had plummeted overnight. Since Aub Neuehausen’s first wife was attending a tea party with other lower-ranking duchies, Ferdinand and the aub met over the gewinnen board. Ferdinand had provided cookies, per Wilfried’s suggestion years ago, and the aub brought a mildly sweet pastry that suited Ferdinand’s tastes much better than anything else he’d been served.</p><p>“Are you and your fiancée doing well?” Aub Neuehausen asked, rubbing at his red beard as he studied the gewinnen board before making his move.</p><p>Ferdinand nodded and countered the aub’s advance easily. “She is busy preparing for the move, but she is otherwise doing well.”</p><p>“Yes, it is rather short notice, isn’t it?” he replied, frowning for several moments before shaking his head and moving another three pieces forward.</p><p>“The speed is necessary to ensure the lands are amply supplied with mana.”</p><p>They exchanged several more moves with Ferdinand blocking the aub at every turn before he finally took pity on him and ended with a swift victory.</p><p>Aub Neuehausen groaned and sat back in his chair, running his hand over his beard. “You’re as good as I heard.”</p><p><em>Wilfried offers a better challenge,</em> Ferdinand thought, but he smiled politely and thanked him. “Shall we play again?”</p><p>“Yes,” the aub readily agreed. “I think I have a handle on your tactics now.”</p><p>Indeed, he improved significantly, though he still didn’t pose any real threat to Ferdinand. As they played, Ferdinand asked, “What are your plans going forward given the changes?”</p><p>Aub Neuehausen knew what he meant and sighed. “We will listen for the wisdom of the gods.”</p><p>In other words, he hadn’t the faintest idea what to do. It had only been a few days since he learned one of the main sources of income for his duchy was to be rendered obsolete in the summer, so that was to be expected.</p><p>“If I might offer a suggestion,” Ferdinand said, “extending the trade routes from Neuehausen through Alexandria to reach Drewanchel would take minimal effort.”</p><p>The aub’s eyes widened, the gewinnen pieces that had just started to move growing still. “You would help facilitate trade between Dunkelfelger and Drewanchel through Neuehausen?” At Ferdinand’s silence, he asked, “What would you ask for in return?”</p><p>“Neuehausen has several unique feyplants, including fey trees, does it not?” Ferdinand asked. “My fiancée would be interested in studying more mundane trees as well. There are also a small number of feybeasts that can only be found in the Southwest, no?”</p><p>“Ah,” he said, nodding and moving his pieces finally, only to frown as Ferdinand swept two of them off the board a moment later. “I had heard you were a man with a Drewanchel mind and Dunkelfelger blood. I can arrange for those items to be delivered to you in exchange for your assistance. Shall we have our scholars draw up the terms and agree on them formally at the next conference?”</p><p>“That seems reasonable enough,” Ferdinand said as he once again took victory on the gewinnen board.</p><p>The meeting with Aub Berschmann was less eventful, though he was by far a stronger gewinnen player than Aub Neuehausen had been. Aub Berschmann agreed to send feyplants and the wood of young, pliable trees to Alexandria starting after the next Archduke Conference, and he would wait for Ferdinand’s letter to establish a border gate.</p><p>The next day, Lestilaut was finally able to meet. Ferdinand went to the Dunkelfelger tea party room and offered his greeting to the young aub before taking a seat at the gewinnen board under a sound-blocking barrier. Once they proved the cookies they both brought weren’t poisoned, they turned their attention to the game. They checked each other’s pieces to ensure they had been emptied of mana before opening the feystone cases and charging all five contained within each. After the usual checks, they closed the compartment and determined that Lestilaut would make the first move.</p><p>“So we’ll soon be neighbors,” Lestilaut said as he moved his pieces forward.</p><p>Ferdinand analyzed the board, running several scenarios through his mind before deciding on the most likely actions the young aub would take. He moved his pieces in a way that appeared to be a slightly modified standard opening but actually set him up to counter the top four possibilities he’d discerned. “Yes. We will need to set up new border gates once I dye Alexandria’s foundation. Are their current locations acceptable, or do you want to move them?”</p><p>Lestilaut shook his head and made his next move, taking the third most likely option Ferdinand had predicted. “Where they are now is fine. Let me offer you a warning - the old Werkestock nobles are an unruly bunch, more so for your half than mine.”</p><p>With a snort, Ferdinand made another move that obfuscated his intentions. “The attack on the former royal family two years ago was proof enough of that.”</p><p>Furrowing his brows, Lestilaut stared at the board for several long moments before finally taking the expected action. He played just as Wilfried’s analysis of him had said. “You’ll need a solid plan to win them over. I trust you won’t rely solely on the fake title my father just granted your fiancée.”</p><p>“Who said it was fake?” Ferdinand asked as he made his first of many counters.</p><p>Lestilaut frowned and offered a counter in turn. “Do not take me for a fool. I know you were the one to lead him to his Wisdom. My only question is did you make Rozemyne get hers after so you could continue to play in the shadows, or had you already taken her down the path but panicked when her kidnapping ruined your plans?”</p><p>Hearing the boy call her so familiarly without a title caused him to bristle, but he hid it behind his sociable smile. “Neither,” he said as he once again made an unclear move on the board. “She found the path on her own during her first year. Mestionora truly guided her.” Coincidence after coincidence had piled up in both weaves until she ended up with the petty goddess’s Divine Instrument. Twice. How else was he meant to interpret such a string of events?</p><p>Snorting with derision, Lestilaut pressed his attack. “Let’s say I believe you. Why hide behind her?”</p><p>“How would the other aubs react to my playing the part rather than Rozemyne?”</p><p>“Well, you did go out of your way to build a certain reputation for yourself.”</p><p>“In a way,” Ferdinand admitted. He had cultivated his outward persona to fight against Veronica with the only tools available to him. Even so, he thought being known as a cold statue pulling strings from the shadows was preferable to being an unruly brat who couldn’t beat a first year from the Tenth duchy at ditter.</p><p>Lestilaut’s moves seemed carefully planned, but a hint of desperation began to show as he tried to counter Ferdinand. “While your actions are understandable, they’re forcing your Goddess of Light to take on a role much too difficult for someone so recently graduated, especially without proper support.”</p><p>His words carried weight given he’d been forced to become Aub Dunkelfelger much earlier than anticipated. However, his analysis of the situation was flawed. “Do you truly think I would abandon my all-goddess to perform her duties alone without supporting her to the best of my ability?” he asked, leveling a look at the fool as he set up his final counter.</p><p>Lestilaut seemed to realize he’d called for Vantole instead of Grammaratur with his last statement. Breaking eye contact after a barely perceptible gulp, he fully fell into Ferdinand’s trap and lost the game.</p><p>“Ah, I will be extending the roads from Neuehausen to Drewanchel to help facilitate trade between all our duchies,” Ferdinand said as he began draining the mana from his pieces. “How is your portion of the books for aubs regarding our true history coming along?”</p><p>“We’re on schedule,” he replied, also clearing away his pieces, “even with printing the maps of the shrines on such short notice.”</p><p>Since that was his father’s fault, Ferdinand saw so reason to comment. Instead, he segued into discussing the state of the printing industry in Dunkelfelger as well as what he understood of the status in the parts of Alexandria that had belonged to the Sovereignty. They also discussed trade goods that Dunkelfelger and the Sovereignty had exchanged, how dark feybeasts in their territories had been handled since the civil war, and who was being appointed High Bishop in both duchies - Rozemyne and one of Lestilaut’s uncles. When the boy brought up the engagement between his cousin and Aub Ahrensbach, Ferdinand pumped him for information, refused to acknowledge his connection to Lucius, and declared that Dregarnuhr had woven swiftly before leaving.</p><p>It sounded as though Lucius’s future First Wife was a typical Dunkelfelger woman, but that was what he needed. The man was too naive to the ways of Yurgenschmidt nobles, and if she lived up to what Lestilaut claimed, she would run circles around anyone in Ahrensbach.</p><p>Not that he cared. He just didn’t want Aub Ahrensbach’s naivety to cause any problems for Alexandria or Ehrenfest. They did share borders, after all.</p><p> </p><p>Two days later, the final assembly took place, starting with the Dedication Ritual. Several blue priests and shrine maidens showed the aubs and their wives where to situate themselves, and since nearly all had participated in the ritual the year before, instructions by and large weren’t necessary. Soon, the Sovereign High Priest, a man Ferdiand didn’t recognize, rang the bell and announced the High Bishop’s entrance. Zent Werdekraf strode through the door, his step wide, his shoulders straight, and his movements powerful. He looked less like a man about to lead a religious ceremony and more like a knight heading to battle. In a way, Ferdinand supposed he was.</p><p>The Zent walked to the front where the divine instruments were set up on the altar and knelt, prompting everyone else to follow suit. “I am one who offers prayer and gratitude to the gods who have created the world,” he intoned, and everyone else followed behind. As expected after a year of everyone saying the prayer when dedicating mana to their foundations, their cadence was nearly perfect, and they followed his words fluently. Mana began draining from Ferdinand, and suddenly, he felt connected to every person present. The sensation was much stronger than he’d ever experienced due to the sheer number of participants, and even his cold heart was moved.</p><p>A pillar of light shot up from the chalice, but few reacted to it. Such an event had become commonplace after Rozemyne and her siblings began rampaging around the Academy.</p><p>Just before the point Ferdinand would have stopped back when he was still part of the temple, Zent Werdekraf lifted his hands from the rug and declared the ritual complete. Everyone was dismissed for lunch mostly so that the mana collected could be poured into the supply and the Farthest Hall cleaned up before the announcements began.</p><p>Lunch in the Ehrenfest dorm was a quiet affair with everyone bracing themselves for the final announcements. Soon, chaos would reign, and they, Dunkelfelger, Ahrensbach, and Corinzdaum would be the only ones exempt from the shock of it. On the brighter side, everyone would be too preoccupied with their own circumstances to notice the five duchies who were unaffected by the news.</p><p> </p><p>The final assembly proceeded as Ferdinand expected. Maps of the shrine locations printed on quality paper were passed out by men and women wearing white capes as they entered the Farthest Hall. The back was stamped with the Rozemyne Workshop crest, just as Ferdinand predicted. Naturally, this garnered several piercing looks from his peers, but he ignored them since none of them would have the opportunity to speak with him again for the remainder of the conference.</p><p>When Zent Werdekraf detailed the way to obtain the Grutrissheit, the air was filled with scratching as scholars hastily scribbled directions on wooden boards or, less commonly, paper. Several of the younger aubs with children who’d yet to obtain their Divine Will were whispering among themselves while older ones were looking on bitterly.</p><p>After that, the Zent declared that within fifteen years, an archduke candidate in every duchy would have to hold the role of High Bishop. This, as expected, caused a serious uproar with some shouting the temples were no place for members of the archducal families to inhabit while others claimed it would reduce their number of suppliers too much.</p><p>“Will you ask them to raise their children within the temple as well?!” someone yelled.</p><p>“Aren’t you just asking us to forcibly remove one of our archduke candidates from the possible line of succession?” cried another.</p><p>The Zent allowed this ruckus to continue for only a brief moment before he raised a hand and threw a hardened glare at the crowd, causing them to fall silent. “‘Why is the Zent doing this?’ you wonder?” he asked. “Simple. The path to the foundation of your duchy is not found within the castle as everyone has come to think. That door acts as a teleporter, just like the dormitory doors here at the Academy. The foundation is located directly underneath the temple, and the true path is found within its walls.”</p><p>Several gasps rent the air.</p><p>“Within the book room in the temple is a carving of Mestionora. Inserting the High Bishop’s bible key into the Grutrissheit she holds will open the door to the foundation. Only those sworn as priests or shrine maidens are able to enter the book room, and only the High Bishop holds the bible and its key. This is why within the next fifteen years, an archduke candidate must be the High Bishop in every duchy.”</p><p>The Zent cast his heavy gaze around the room and nodded. “I can see you are taking this seriously. I shall end the conference here so that you may go secure the path to your foundations.”</p><p>After giving his final parting words and stating that he looked forward to all of their threads crossing again at the Interduchy Tournament, he escorted his wife from the hall, followed by both of their entourages and all their ministers.</p><p>As expected, chaos erupted as aubs rushed from the room in an effort to secure their foundations as soon as possible. Alexandria, Ehrenfest, Dunkelfelger, Corinzdaum, and Ahrensbach waited patiently for the panicked aubs and their wives to leave before they leisurely made their way back to their dorms, giving each other acknowledging nods along the way.</p><p>“Well, Little Brother,” Sylvester said after they entered the common room, “how was your first Archduke Conference?”</p><p>“Long and somewhat pointless,” Ferdinand replied. “As I do not hold a foundation, nor do I have the faintest idea of the state of my would-be lands, I was unable to conduct any meaningful negotiations.”</p><p>“You made connections, though, right?”</p><p>“...A couple,” Ferdinand admitted.</p><p>“Good,” Sylvester said as he patted him on the back. “I wanted to take you around myself, but since you’re higher ranked…”</p><p>Ferdinand shook his head. “I understand the predicament you were in. We will undoubtedly drop below you next year, so you can do the introductions then.”</p><p>His older brother opened his mouth with a look that said he was going to protest, but then he just nodded and said, “We’ll have the post-conference meeting after we return, and then tomorrow, you and I will have a private meeting. Understood?”</p><p>Tapping the side of his head, Ferdinand sighed and lamented the preparation time he would lose in favor of gentlemen’s education, though he understood he would ultimately benefit from it. Even so, he had so little time before his summer departure. “Very well,” he said at last. His aides were competent, after all, and would complete their assignments by the time they needed to leave.</p><p>Before long, they entered the teleportation hall. Despite technically being a higher-ranking aub, Ferdinand would return before his brother and sister-in-law since they were going back to their duchy.</p><p>When he arrived, all of the archducal clan was there to greet him, including Rozemyne, whose noble smile sat stiffly upon her lips. She was likely thinking of the private meeting they would have later. The thought made Ferdinand’s stomach clench, but he hid it behind his usual stoic mask.</p><p>“Uncle!” Melchior called as he rushed forward. “How was the conference?”</p><p>“It was as I expected.”</p><p>“So Rozemyne didn’t do anything crazy while she was there?” Wilfried asked.</p><p>Ferdinand snorted. “I said it was as expected.”</p><p>Charlotte shot her sister a look, but Rozemyne pointedly turned her gaze away.</p><p>The questioning came to an end as the archducal couple appeared. Everyone offered their greetings, and Sylvester announced they would meet in his office in half a bell to discuss the conference before leaving with Florencia. The room began to empty, and Ferdinand held a hand out to Rozemyne to escort her. She once again gave him a strained smile, and as they walked, the cuff on Ferdinand’s ear warmed. He pulsed mana into it and asked, “Yes?”</p><p>“Are we going to meet after this?” she asked, dipping her head a little to keep Justus from reading her lips.</p><p>“If your schedule allows,” he said. “Will you be going to the temple?”</p><p>“Yes, I plan to meet with some of my downtown associates tomorrow morning, so I will go there this afternoon and stay the night.”</p><p>“Hmm… I need to arrange a meeting with some of them myself.”</p><p>“Is it about…?” Her voice trailed off as her cheeks tinged pink.</p><p>“In addition to other matters, yes,” Ferdinand replied, facing forward and willing his ears to remain cool. There was nothing to be embarrassed about. All he would be discussing with the merchants or craftspeople would be ways to ensure fewer unwanted children were born. It was far better for him to broach this topic than his underaged fiancée, and if he didn’t, she would.</p><p> </p><p>The announcements made at the meeting came as no surprise to those gathered, save perhaps their new rankings and everyone’s shock that Alexandria was the Third and Ehrenfest the Fifth. When it came time for the family-only meeting, Ferdinand and Rozemyne decided to take their leave. They were privy to most of the news that would be shared, but Charlotte and Wilfried wanted to discuss what trends to disseminate at the Academy, which neither Ferdinand nor Rozemyne could take part in. The children were all visibly upset to see them leave, and Melchior in particular looked ready to cry as the reality of their impending move settled upon him. Though Rozemyne hid it well, Ferdinand could tell she was just as upset, which meant Ferdinand had a significant amount of hugging in his immediate future.</p><p>After they parted ways, Ferdinand went to his hidden room at his estate and waited for Rozemyne’s arrival. As he’d guessed, the moment she appeared, she leapt off the circle and into his open arms where she bawled into his chest as he stroked her soft hair. Eventually, he pulled her over to his bench where she sat beside him and wept into his shoulder. He rubbed her back in gentle circles, waiting for her to calm down.</p><p>“Rozemyne,” he said at last, “we don’t have infinite time together.”</p><p>“Y-you’re right,” she sniffled, wiping at her face. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>Placing his hand over her eyes, he said, “Don’t apologize. May Heilschmerz’s healing be granted.” After waschening his robes, he tucked some of her hair behind her ear. “You aren’t leaving them like you did your downtown family,” he said. “You’ll still be in Ehrenfest until the end of Fall, and then you’ll see Wilfried and Charlotte at the Academy. Sylvester, Florencia, Karstedt, and Elvira will come to the Interduchy Tournament as well. Perhaps the only one you won’t see is Bonifatius, but I imagine he’ll visit Alexandria upon occasion, whether we want him to or not.”</p><p>That made her giggle. “Yes, Grandfather can be a little forceful.”</p><p><em>Yes, like how a goltze can be a little troublesome,</em> he thought.</p><p>“Anyway,” she said, her eyes drifting down, “we have other things to discuss today.”</p><p>Ferdinand gave a stiff nod. “Yes, I… recently learned that some of my perceptions of noble society are not quite correct, mostly where it comes to interacting with women.”</p><p>“That’s no surprise,” Rozemyne said. “You hate women after all.”</p><p>“I don’t hate them,” he corrected her. “I simply do not wish to interact with them if possible, present company excluded.”</p><p>Rozemyne tilted her head and leaned forward slightly so she could catch his eye. “So one of those misconceptions led to our argument?”</p><p>He had to look away from her in order to tell her the story, but he explained what had happened to make him believe everyone in the audience would think the worst of him when the amulets on her legs began to glow and what Sylvester had to say on the matter. She listened in silence, and when he finished speaking, she laid her hand over his and gave it a gentle squeeze.</p><p>“I didn’t mean to trudge up such horrible memories,” she said. “I…um… I hope you know that… Well, I should say that I… um… I haven’t done… anything inappropriate… with your mana.” She flicked her face away from him so fast that her hair slapped against his arm. “Ahhh! This is so embarrassing!”</p><p>Ferdinand looked away, feeling just as uncomfortable.</p><p>“So you’re getting gentlemen’s education?” she asked. “I thought they did that for boys after they developed mana sensing. There’s no way someone with your memory would have forgotten, even if you weren’t interested.”</p><p>“They only went over the mechanics,” he said, “namely how to ensure your mana is synchronized and the steps involved to give your partner Geduldh’s burden.”</p><p>“Oh, that is pretty bare bones,” she said. “They didn’t talk about diseases or contraception?”</p><p>“What diseases?”</p><p>“Eh?” Rozemyne tilted her head again. “Do they not have them here? In the dream world, you could get all sorts of illnesses from summoning winter. Learning about them was a big part of our ladies’ and gentlemen’s education, though I guess it’s more accurate to call it winter education since we took it together.”</p><p>“You were educated on the matters of winter with boys present?!” Ferdinand asked, aghast.</p><p>“Yeah, some places still separate the genders, but my school didn’t. Anyway, it seems what I learned is only partially applicable to Yurgenschmidt. We didn’t have mana, after all.”</p><p>Sighing, Ferdinand rubbed at his temples and tried to push the bizarre, highly inappropriate place where she’d originally lived from his mind. The utter shamelessness was beyond his ability to grasp.</p><p>“I’ve been getting bits and pieces of ladies’ education as I’ve grown,” she said, shifting topics slightly. “I guess I won’t be able to complete it since I’m leaving home two years early.”</p><p>The sad, wistful tone in her voice pulled at his heart. “Elvira and Florencia won’t leave you with a partial education. I’m sure they’re devising a plan to ensure you’re able to complete it.”</p><p>“Maybe…” With a sigh, she shook her head and said, “Benno, Otto, and Freida are coming tomorrow.”</p><p>“I’m aware.”</p><p>“Yeah, well, I’m going to ask them for input on designing our lower city. The Zent is creating a whole new foundation, right? He’ll probably place it close to the center of Alexandria, where there aren’t likely to already be any big cities. One thing I want to look at is having several inns so that we can welcome plenty of merchants in summer. There’s also the restaurant, stores, workshops, and commoner housing to consider in addition to walls…”</p><p>Rozemyne’s voice trailed off as Ferdinand took a lock of her lustrous hair and brought it to his nose to take in its floral scent. Speaking about his past had left a heavy pall over him, and the fragrance of her rinsham never failed to calm his anxiety.</p><p>She stared at him, her eyes wide and cheeks pink. Was this not the same girl who had covered herself in his mana to declare to the entire country that she belonged to him? He touched her hair all the time in his hidden room, and he’d kissed it the night Lanzenave invaded. Why was she acting bashful now?</p><p>“Continue,” he said, not letting go of her hair.</p><p>“R-right,” she said, squirming in her seat. “Um… Oh, I think the walls should be as far out as we can make them so we have room to grow. If Ehrenfest had a place to put up another inn, we would’ve been in much better shape, I think. Zent Werdekraf is building the temple, right? We should have the library castle nearby so it’s easy for me to go back and forth.”</p><p>Ferdinand’s brows shot up. “Library castle?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Sighing, he dropped her hair to tap at his temple as he said, “We’ll look at that later when we start making blueprints.” He wanted to make the castle, library, and research facilities all separate buildings, but that was a debate they could have at a later date. “I am interested in hearing your associates’ input, however. Have Hartmut send the report over at his earliest convenience.”</p><p>She nodded and ran her hands over the lock of hair he’d released, a small smile playing at her lips. What an endearing picture she painted.</p><p>“Speaking of Hartmut,” Ferdinand said, “I would like to take him and Clarissa with me to Alexandria this summer if you will allow it.”</p><p>“Hmm… I suppose you do need more than just Justice acting as a scholar. However, they can’t go until after their starbind.”</p><p>That would delay his plans and reduce his timeline significantly, but it was better than nothing.</p><p>Before he could agree, however, Rozemyne launched into an explanation. “First, I only got permission to bring Clarissa to Ehrenfest, not to take her to Alexandria. Ahrensbach was an exception since it was dire circumstances, and we had Dunkelfelger knights coming with us as well. They need to be married for her to truly be my retainer and thus able to leave Ehrenfest.</p><p>“Also, Hartmut and Clarissa heard about the Zent investiture ceremony at the Archduke Conference, so to calm them down before they could cause irreversible damage, I promised to offer a special blessing for their starbind.”</p><p>Well, it was a small price to pay to control those two. He didn’t even want to imagine the state she’d found them in before she made that promise. “Will it be a private blessing after the ceremony?”</p><p>She nodded. “I don’t want them to start their proselytizing and ruin everyone else’s starbind. Instead, I made them swear on their schtappes to not say a word about me until after I gave them their own special blessing. At least then I can leave them alone in a room to preach at each other so they don’t bother anyone else.”</p><p>Smirking, he reached for her hair again as he said, “Not bad.” Her endearing blush returned as he lifted her hair to his lips. Something about the smell, color, and texture filled him with a sense of calm and warmth. It would be a sad day once she started tying it up and he could no longer play with it as he desired.</p><p>Except when he untied it, of course.</p><p>He quickly pushed the thought from his mind and decided to ask her to keep a lock of it loose for him. Once they tied their stars, he didn’t think he would be able to stop touching it, and that was the most sensible solution.</p><p>“Y-You really like my hair, don’t you?” she asked, squirming in her seat again.</p><p>“I do,” he admitted, causing her eyes to widen and her hands to go to her cheeks. “Your hair is as dark as the night sky and as comforting to me as the God of Darkness’s cloak is to the Goddess of Light. It shimmers brighter than the sea at midday and smells of Bluanfah’s sweet flowers at the first blush of spring. There is nothing I would change about it.” Except perhaps to keep it all to himself, but he didn’t voice the ridiculous notion.</p><p>Rozemyne squealed in a most undignified manner as she covered her face and kicked her feet. “How can you say those sorts of things and then not let me kiss you?!”</p><p>Raising an eyebrow at her, he said, “I merely stated facts. That is no reason to engage in such shameless behavior.”</p><p>“It’s not shameless!” she protested. “We’re engaged!”</p><p>“And you have not reached your autumn,” he reminded her. Again.</p><p>“So once I do reach my autumn, I can kiss you then?”</p><p>Ferdinand’s mind went blank for just a moment. He’d been so concerned with respecting her age that he’d kept himself from thinking too much about where they would stand after he returned from Alexandria.</p><p>He’d only given two excuses for not kissing her before - she was too young, and she deserved somewhere better than his hidden room for their first kiss. The first reason was immutable - he would not engage in that sort of behavior with someone underaged. The second had been a desperate attempt to cool Brenwarmme’s flames within her.</p><p>Once she was no longer in her summer, though, there was no reason to abstain from the act. He still wanted to offer her better than a hidden room, but he also didn’t have any confidence that he would stop if the opportunity presented itself as it had in the past.</p><p>Rozemyne took his silent reverie as an affirmative and gave him a mischievous grin. “Well then. I’m only a season away from turning fifteen. We should prepare appropriately.” She held out her hand, and her palm began to glow as though she were about to summon her schtappe.</p><p>The tips of his ears began to burn as he covered the bottom half of his face with a hand. “It’s much too soon for that.”</p><p>“Not according to my mothers. They were surprised we hadn’t already started.”</p><p>Narrowing his eyes at her, he said, “Are you certain that’s what they meant?”</p><p>She brimmed with confidence as she nodded. “Yes! Florencia said that since we live in the same duchy, have been engaged for years, and aren’t a purely political match that she expected we would have started mixing mana at least a little bit when I returned from the Academy this year.”</p><p>So he wasn’t too far off the mark for wanting to wait until they moved to Alexandria at least. Her outstretched hand still glowed, but memories of her casting copy and place on his Wisdom flashed through his mind, making him hesitate. She’d been completely innocent then and unaware of his affections. This time, however, not only was she fully aware of them, she was too willing to physically return them. If his body reacted the same way it did then and she tried to get carried away, he might get swept along with her.</p><p>Of course, a bit of mana on a palm was much different from her spreading her mana all over his schtappe. It would be like comparing the flames of a hearth to a bonfire. Probably. It wasn’t as though he’d been on the receiving end of her mana before aside from that one incident.</p><p>Feeling as though he were signing his own execution order, he pooled mana in his palm and took her hand.</p><p>Rozemyne gasped, and he stiffened as the warmth and slight tingle of her mana enveloped his hand and began traveling up his arm. It moved slowly but encountered almost no resistance. His, however, poured into her as easily as pouring water from a cup, as though she were made to accept it. Well, in a way, he supposed she was.</p><p>The sensation was most comparable to having Rozemyne trail her fingers across the back of his hand and up his arm. While it caused his heart to race and the embers of Brenwarmme’s fire to glow, the effect wasn’t nearly as strong as copying and placing into his Grutrissheit was. He almost sighed with relief. This much was easily manageable.</p><p>His fiancée, however, seemed to have a different opinion. She’d turned away from him, and the sliver of her face he could see was deep red. Her fist gripped her skirts forcefully enough to tear them if she weren’t careful, and she squirmed in her seat.</p><p>After only a couple of moments, she ripped her hand away with a squeak, covered her face, and turned her entire body away from him.</p><p>Worried he’d done something to upset her, Ferdinand called, “Rozemyne?”</p><p>“Ahh! Don’t talk to me right now!” she yelled.</p><p>“Why not?” he asked, his stomach sinking. “Did I do something to hurt you?”</p><p>“No!” She took several deep breaths. “The opposite. I… I knew I was already dyed, but I wasn’t expecting… Mother and Florencia insisted there would be at least a little resistance, but there wasn’t any at all! Ahh! This is so embarrassing!”</p><p>Now that he understood, he couldn’t suppress the urge to return all the teasing she’d tortured him with over the past year. “Were you not the one who insisted on mixing mana?” he asked.</p><p>“I was but…!”</p><p>“Was it too much for you?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“I understand. We shall refrain from doing it again until you graduate from the Academy.”</p><p>She spun on him, her eyes wide. “No!” she cried. “It’s crazy to wait that long!”</p><p>Ferdinand shrugged. “Perhaps, but we cannot continue if only a moment of it leaves you in this state. As you are already dyed, it is unnecessary to begin with.”</p><p>She blinked at him in disbelief before her eyes narrowed. “You’re just teasing me, aren’t you?”</p><p>“I am,” he admitted, taking pleasure in the pout she gave him and the remaining softness of her cheek when he pinched it.</p><p>She brushed his hand away since he wasn’t pinching her seriously. “Maybe… Maybe we can wait a little bit before we do it again,” she muttered. “Not very long, though. Just… Just a little bit.”</p><p>Taking up another lock of her hair, he said, “As you wish.”</p><p>She looked away and stared at one of his shelves for several moments, though her gaze was unfocused. Eventually, she said, “This is kind of off topic, but… I know I apologized before, but I wanted to say I was sorry again. Both my mothers said it would have been better to talk to you about my plan, but I was able to convince them to go along with it regardless. I should have discussed it with you. Then, we might have cleared up this whole misunderstanding before it ended up causing you such distress.”</p><p>Letting go of her hair, he turned to face her seriously. He would have absolutely been against her plan, and he was afraid to admit he might have been pressed to use her name out of desperation since he believed the display to mean more than it did. He didn’t want to give anyone any more reasons to look down on her. She had enough strikes against her in noble society with being engaged to a motherless “Ewigeliebe” and growing up in the temple, both of which were his doing. He didn’t want to be the cause for a third.</p><p>That was all the more reason to do what he could to ensure such gaps in communication didn’t occur in the future. “Rozemyne,” he said, letting his hands ball into fists on his lap, “I never paid any heed to the relationship between men and women. More accurately speaking, I actively avoided the topic. Even with Sylvester’s help, I cannot promise to rectify all of the gaps in my knowledge. However, I will attempt to correct them regardless and to keep myself from falling victim to my emotions.” He grit his teeth and looked away. “Had I but thought for a moment, I would have reasoned out that things were not as dire as my initial reaction suggested.”</p><p>She laid her hand over his again, wrapping her fingers around his clenched fist until it relaxed. “All we can do is keep trying to do better,” she said.</p><p>“Not that it will be an issue for much longer,” he sighed with some relief.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>He raised an eyebrow at her. “We’ll tie our stars in two years, and we’ll have much more leeway in terms of what’s socially acceptable than we do now with your being underaged.” With his free hand, he grabbed another lock of her hair and brought it to his lips. “There will be nothing barred between us then, so we will not have to worry about the assumptions of others.”</p><p>Her face flushed red as she covered her cheeks in embarrassment. “F-F-Ferdinand, I—“</p><p>A light flashed at her neck, and she jumped with a squeak. “Oh! My attendants are calling for me!”</p><p>“Rozemyne,” Ferdinand asked, “what is that?”</p><p>Grinning smugly, she pulled a necklace from under her collar and displayed it for him. “It’s a magic tool that lets me know when someone is calling at my hidden room door. After studying the magic circles on the ear cuffs, I came up with the design.”</p><p>“What?” he asked, grabbing the pendant and pushing a little magical power into it to see its circle. He hadn’t considered making anything like it, but it was utterly useless to anyone but the two of them, unless Zent Werdekraf or Eglantine connected their hidden rooms to another location.</p><p>His eyes traced over the beautiful, intricate lines of the magic circle, and he gave an impressed grunt. Still, there was one glaring issue. “Who did you get to help you construct this?” If it were Hartmut as he suspected, then he’d need to seal the scholar’s lips with contract magic since he would piece together the truth of the situation in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“No one!” Rozemyne declared proudly, causing Ferdinand’s thoughts to come to a screeching halt. “When I saw what you had done with the ear cuffs, I thought I could use the Wind portion of the magic circle and modify the Light part, so I…” Her eyes narrowed at him before her cheeks puffed out in displeasure. “Why do you look so surprised? I got first in class in the scholar course two years in a row, and you taught me yourself! Plus, I was super motivated to make this work.”</p><p>“I didn’t realize you had progressed so far,” he admitted. He’d only known her to replicate, not create. Any time she’d needed a new magic circle, she’d reached out to him or Hartmut to develop it. “I am truly impressed.” Analyzing it again, he muttered, “It’s reasonably efficient as well. Very good, Rozemyne.”</p><p>Her cheeks turned Geduldh’s noble color as she grinned shamelessly and giggled, repeating his words of praise to herself.</p><p>As much as he wanted to spend more time with her, they didn’t have the option. “You need to return,” he said, letting some of the regret show.</p><p>“Yeah, I know,” she pouted before she wrapped him in a tight hug. He chuckled and returned the embrace, once again letting his fingers run through her silken hair.</p><p>Reluctantly, she pulled away and walked towards the transportation circle. “I’ll see you soon,” she said with a little wave before disappearing in a flash of gold and black.</p><p>The temperature dropped significantly in her absence, and the room felt empty despite the piles and piles of notes, books, and research materials. Melancholy settled over Ferdinand as he stood and got to work packing and preparing for his quickly approaching departure.</p>

<p>Fighting the urge to sigh, Ferdinand braced himself and entered the Aub’s office. There waiting for him was Sylvester, who sat at a table set with glasses, multiple bottles of vize, and a variety of both salty and sweet snacks. With a wave of his hand, his older brother cleared the room and then invited Ferdinand to take a seat.</p><p>“Does this not seem excessive?” Ferdinand asked, looking pointedly at the copious amounts of alcohol.</p><p>Sylvester shrugged and filled their glasses, taking a sip to show it wasn’t poisoned before trying one of each of the snacks. “Look, it’s for me so that I can hopefully block out who you’re going to be using this knowledge with later. And don’t give me that look. No one wants to think about their daughter one day inviting winter.” He drained the glass and poured himself another. Meanwhile, Ferdinand had yet to touch his.</p><p>“And speaking of,” Sylvester continued, “I’m going to go ahead and address what we’re pretending is under Verbergen’s shroud. You and I both know Rozemyne is going to come of age next season, and then you two are going to another duchy this winter. A duchy where you will both be recognized as aub by the foundation, so the typical shields blocking winter will be lowered. I’m going to move forward taking that into consideration and be realistic rather than idealistic. Alright?”</p><p>Ferdinand raised an eyebrow. “Realistic in what regard?”</p><p>“In the regard that you have two years until your starbind, Rozemyne is a beautiful woman, and you’ll have as much access to each other as you want once you become Aub Alexandria and she returns from the Academy. You could connect your hidden rooms with teleportation circles to get around your retainers if you wanted, among other things.”</p><p>“Do you think I would dishonor her before our starbind?” Ferdinand asked, anger, disgust, and shame welling up inside him.</p><p>Sylvester snorted and replied, “I think you’re a man and woman in love with opportunity. You’ve only got three ways to actually dishonor her.” He held up his fingers as he counted them off. “Welcome winter before autumn, let someone catch you two engaged in frigid activities, or give her Geduldh’s burden before your starbind. Number one is about to be a nonissue, you can easily circumvent number two, and I’m going to help you ensure number three doesn’t happen.”</p><p>Ferdinand shook his head in disbelief. “Surely you’re not suggesting I engage in such shameless behavior.”</p><p>“You really think I didn’t when Florencia came during our engagement?” Sylvester asked, causing Ferdinand’s thoughts to halt as he fought to keep his jaw from dropping at the revelation. “It’s really only political matches like Karstedt’s first two where everything’s hands off until the contract burns. Why do you think those moving to other duchies for marriage are only given a short time together before their starbind? It’s because that’s about the amount of time it takes once you start actively mixing mana before you can comfortably move beyond exploring the winter landscape by touch.”</p><p>Was his brother actually confessing to inappropriately touching his Goddess of Light before their starbind? And then encouraging him to do the same? Regardless, his assertions made little sense. “But surely the need for synchronization potions–”</p><p>“Alright, I’m going to stop you there,” Sylvester said, holding up a hand. “Yeah, trying to welcome winter without synchronizing first is pretty awful.” He spoke as if he had first-hand experience, which suggested he’d attempted it before he was married since there was no reason to forgo taking the potions afterwards. He’d always been a master at slipping away from his retinue, but how had he gotten Florencia away from hers long enough to…? “However, there is a lot you can do besides that, and trust me - it’s worth the slight rejection.” Sylvester paused and then sighed. “Not that it’ll be a problem for you, given you’ve already dyed her. <em>With medicine.</em> Yeah, yeah, I know. No need to protest.”</p><p>Ferdinand closed his mouth.</p><p>“Anyway,” Sylvester said, refilling both their glasses before popping a cookie in his mouth, “there are steps to all of this.”</p><p>“I’m aware,” he interrupted. “After you take the potion–”</p><p>“What? No!” his brother barked. “Good gods! Was your plan really to go from only escorting her to suddenly welcoming winter? You can’t go from nothing to everything like that!”</p><p>“You just said political matches–”</p><p>Sylvester waved him to silence. “Look, most political matches don’t welcome winter right away, either. They drink the potion for appearance’s sake and then build up to it. They normally get there before the effects wear off, though. Of course, it doesn’t always happen that way, but I’d say it’s a good seven out of ten times.</p><p>“Anyway, just like there are seasons in life, there are stages to a physical relationship.” Sylvester went on to detail them, explaining that first was usually things like holding hands or hugging. At some point, that would progress to mixing mana. “I would expect you to already be doing that at this point,” he said, “except you don’t really need to. Still, it’s pretty nice when you’re synched, so… Oh!” His face split into a mischievous grin. “Never mind. I see you’ve already experienced it for yourself. We can move on.”</p><p>“You can see no such thing,” Ferdinand snapped.</p><p>“Your ears are practically shouting it,” he teased.</p><p>With a grunt, Ferdinand tossed back the rest of his vize and slammed the glass down on the table before refilling it. Curse his hair for being unable to hide his blushing ears!</p><p>After mixing mana, a couple would typically start kissing, though it may start with the back of the hand or cheek to avoid the repulsion from their partner’s mana-rich saliva. Once they could handle the tingle, though, they would move on to the lips. This apparently naturally escalated to getting tongues involved, which either preceded or coincided with letting one’s hands get covered in frost.</p><p>“I’d say many people bind their stars pretty soon after they reach that point,” Sylvester said, crossing his arms as he thought. “With your starbind so far away and your mana already synched, you could get there before the next feast celebrating spring, and that’s taking her time in the Royal Academy into account.”</p><p>Ferdinand scoffed. “You think so little of my self control?”</p><p>Running a hand down his face, Sylvester said, “Look, she’s my daughter, and I love her, but she’s a force of nature, and I’ve seen how skillfully she can make you dance in the palm of her hand. No, don’t waste your breath trying to deny it.”</p><p>Once again, Ferdinand clamped his mouth shut.</p><p>“All I’m saying is if your fiancée wants to go play in the snow, I think she’d use every tactic in that gremlin brain of hers to have you standing in the middle of a blizzard before you even realized you were going outside.”</p><p>He felt the blood drain from his face as he envisioned that exact scenario playing out.</p><p>“Hey, don’t look so scared,” Sylvester said in a comforting tone. “I’m telling you that as long as you don’t break one of the three rules, you’re fine. Look, like I said, there are all sorts of things you can do short of welcoming winter.”</p><p>He then went on to list such acts of depravity that Ferdinand could scarcely believe his ears. Surely his brother couldn’t be suggesting Rozemyne would engage in such behavior, and before their starbind, no less! The mere thought made his heart simultaneously thunder and freeze over. Despite how appalled he was, he knew the images Sylvester’s descriptions had briefly conjured would return to haunt him for years to come.</p><p>Eventually, his brother grew quiet and then sighed. “Alright, with that out of the way, let’s talk about the most important part of any physical relationship since you’re going to struggle with it the most.”</p><p>He nearly shuddered to think what his brother believed was worse than what he’d already said.</p><p>Sylvester stared Ferdinand in the eye and said, “The most important thing is communication.”</p><p>He blinked in mild confusion.</p><p>“Yeah, I figured you’d give me that look,” Sylvester sighed. “You have to talk with your partner. Be open about what you’re feeling, both emotionally and physically. Tell her if something makes you happy, sad, whatever, or if something feels good or hurts or if you want to try something new. Talk about what kinds of things you like or think you might like, and the things you don’t. That doesn’t just apply to inviting winter, either. I know you two have had some decent conversations over the years, but if what happened at the Archduke Conference is anything to go by, you still have some issues.”</p><p>Ferdinand tapped at his temple as he recalled his and Rozemyne’s most recent conversation. “I’m well aware. We are both making efforts to improve.”</p><p>“Good. Keep doing that,” Sylvester said with a nod. After giving a few tips, he began to talk about inviting winter.</p><p>“So before the sword can meet the chalice, you first have to summon Flutrane’s waters–”</p><p>Ferdinand blinked in mild surprise. He’d known the lubricant the chalice produced could be referred to as Flutrane’s waters, but he’d always assumed the phrase “summon Flutrane’s waters” was about dowsing Brennwarme’s flames. Suddenly, several conversations he’d overheard throughout the years took on a different meaning.</p><p>His conversation with Rozemyne about pet names came to mind, and he filed it away with other vitally important information to be used at a later date.</p><p>Once Sylvester finished explaining the basics of summoning winter, he went on to describe a myriad of positions one could use for the ritual, most of which sounded implausible or demeaning. Also, what aub would have enough room on their desk for such a thing? Was that what Sylvester had been up to while Ferdinand was doing his work in the temple?</p><p>“So, let’s talk about ways to keep Entrinduge from visiting,” Sylvester said. “First, of course, is to ensure the sword doesn’t meet the chalice when playing winter games. Second is to spill any snow outside of the chalice. You can also avoid summoning winter at certain times, but to be honest with you, I don’t really know when those are. It’s related to when Geduldh’s soil turns, so I’m certain Florencia will teach Rozemyne about it if she hasn’t already.”</p><p>Ferdinand waited, but when his brother didn’t continue, he asked, “Is that all?”</p><p>“Huh? Uh, yeah.”</p><p>“You don’t use an amulet or a potion?”</p><p>Sylvester scratched the back of his head and sighed. “You would immediately think of that. I remember hearing about a potion like that once, but supposedly the man who took it had something unspeakable happen to Beischmacht’s pouches, so no one’s touched it since.”</p><p>Rozemyne had been right. There was a completely untapped market for nobles that they could take advantage of. The moment she let that slip to Benno, he’d latch on like a wolfiniel to its prey. He could see them turning it into a major duchy industry, and while the patents would likely bring ludicrous profits, he could imagine nothing more shameful for his duchy to be known for. It would be a number of years before they could even think of bringing it to market regardless given how low the noble population still was.</p><p>“On that note,” Sylvester said, “let’s talk about your duties as a father once your wife takes on Geduldh’s burden. You have to supply mana, too, and there are many ways to do it. My personal favorite, of course, is summoning winter.”</p><p>Ferdinand narrowed his eyes at his brother. “While she’s already carrying the burden? Does that not risk hurting the child?”</p><p>“Huh?” Sylvester asked, one of his eyebrows shooting up his forehead. “No, not at all. The burden is carried above that part of the chalice. Anyway, it’s not like you’ll have much choice regardless. Women can get very, <em>very</em> demanding at certain points before Entrinduge visits. It’s not the only way, though. You can give it directly by placing your hand on her stomach and channeling a little mana into her, and she can then cycle it to the baby. There’s also…”</p><p>His explanation continued for a while, covering not only mana donation but also changes to expect in the woman, his place when she gave birth, the amount of healing and rest she would need after, how long they would need to refrain from winter play, how to support her while she was in the nursing period, and how to protect a newborn.</p><p>“When you get to Alexandria,” Sylvester said, “I would immediately start looking for a competent doctor for Rozemyne. You don’t want to wait until you find out Entrinduge is going to visit. The doctor will need to get to know what’s normal for her so she’s able to notice if something is going wrong as soon as possible.”</p><p>In this weave, Lieseleta hadn’t focused on medical courses because Rozemyne had been healthy the entire time she knew her. Gretia had out of personal interest, but Ferdinand wasn’t certain of her competence. He would have to test her. If she failed, either he would have to encourage her to take her studies more seriously or seek out a doctor in their new territory.</p><p>How troublesome.</p><p>“Anyway, that’s probably enough for now,” Sylvester said. “We can do the rest when you return in the fall.”</p><p><em>Good gods, there’s</em> more?!</p><p> </p><p>Some days later, Ferdinand sat at a table in his estate across from a slightly trembling Otto under a sound-blocking barrier. The merchant had come as requested by Rozemyne to “discuss the production of a new product,” but he hadn’t been provided any other information. Ferdinand hadn’t worked much with the man, so he didn’t enjoy the same rapport with him he did with Benno or Lutz, but he hoped the conversation would be fruitful nonetheless.</p><p>“What I’ve brought you here to discuss should not leave this room without my express permission. Understood?”</p><p>Otto gulped and nodded.</p><p><em>So much for building rapport,</em> Ferdinand admonished himself. Still, he pressed on. “As you might have heard, the temple is becoming a more reputable place, and it will soon cease to offer flowers altogether. However, my fiancée is concerned this will lead to those who sought such… services to seek them elsewhere, bringing harm to innocent victims. We thought to ask about the possibility of creating an establishment to fill the void the temple is leaving behind.”</p><p>Blinking several times, Otto brought his hand to his chin and thought for a moment. “My lord, waitresses in most restaurants fill that role, so I’m not certain the loss will be felt very widely.”</p><p>“Perhaps for commoners,” Ferdinand said, causing Otto’s eyes to widen with understanding.</p><p>“I see. If you are talking to me about this, I assume you plan to have commoner women involved?”</p><p>“Men and women, yes, and perhaps some individuals with small amounts of mana. They would have to be willing to work there. We will not engage in the purchasing or placement of individuals against their will.”</p><p>He nodded slowly as he considered the new information. “So long as the aub approves it, I believe it could be a profitable business. I can’t speak for those with mana, but there would be commoners willing to take part if they are compensated well enough.”</p><p>“Well enough” for a commoner was a pittance, so Ferdinand saw no issue there.</p><p>“Were there any special concerns about this venture?” Otto asked hesitantly.</p><p>Ferdinand kept his expression neutral as he said, “We would like to prevent unwanted children from being born as a result of someone’s patronage.”</p><p>“Ah,” Otto said as he nervously rubbed at his chin. “Forgive me, my lord, but while there are some herbs that are supposed to reduce the chances, there is no way to completely prevent it.”</p><p>It was as he’d feared. Waving a hand, he called Justus over, who presented a box to Otto. The merchant opened it and blinked a few times before pulling out the sheet of dried gumka sap.</p><p>“I trust you are familiar with that material?” Ferdinand asked.</p><p>He nodded. “We’ve been using it in clothing recently.”</p><p>“Good. I want you to look into the possibility of making a sheath for a sword with it.”</p><p>Otto blinked at him. “Um… How big of a sword, my lord?”</p><p>“They don’t vary that much in length, do they? The material is stretchy, so if you make it for the average size, it should accommodate most.”</p><p>“Forgive my ignorance, but wouldn’t a sword cut through this material?”</p><p>Ferdinand narrowed his eyes at him for a moment before he realized what was happening. Otto, being a commoner, was unfamiliar with noble euphemisms, at least as far as they applied to this scenario. The problem, however, was that Ferdinand was just as unfamiliar with the language people in the lower city used for these things.</p><p>With a sigh, he raised a hand to summon Justus again.</p><p>“Yes, my lord?”</p><p>“Justus, you are not to speak a word of what transpires in this sound barrier unless otherwise instructed.”</p><p>His attendant stiffened slightly, and when he gave verbal acknowledgement of the order, Ferdinand explained the situation and asked if he would be able to bridge the communication gap.</p><p>With an amused smile, Justus nodded and then acted as an intermediary from that point forward.</p><p>Once Otto understood the request, his cheeks reddened, but he approached it with all the gravity of a proper merchant. “I see. We can already make it pretty thin, but I can talk with our craftspeople about making it even thinner, with your permission, my lord.” Ferdinand gave a brisk nod. “There’s going to be a lot of trial and error with this, I’m afraid, so I cannot say when or even if we’ll have results, my lord.”</p><p>“I ask that you do your utmost to make this succeed,” Ferdinand said. “Before you depart, I have an order for a hairpin I would like to place.”</p><p>Justus handed over an order form with a small box. Otto looked inside at the engraved stick and mana-dyed thread Ferdinand wanted to use and then nodded. “I will give it to our best craftswoman.”</p><p>“See that you do.”</p><p>After Otto left, Ferdinand went to his hidden room and leaned against the door with a heavy sigh. He was fairly certain he’d spoken more about winter deeds in the past season than he had in his entire two lives combined, and it was taxing. What business did an unmarried man have talking about such things? He should have been spending the time focusing on his departure and duties as the future Aub Alexandria, however temporary.</p><p>Sighing again, he started packing what remained of his hidden room until Justus called for him, saying his students had arrived.</p><p>Ferdinand exited the hidden room and went to greet the four archduke candidates. Then, he assigned Justus to instruct Charlotte, Janrik to help Melchior, and Eckhart to train Wilfried. “Rozemyne, join me in the library.”</p><p>“With pleasure!” she beamed.</p><p>“We’re not going to read.”</p><p>Her disappointment was palpable.</p><p>He led her into the library and went to one of the shelves to pull down a large scroll that he unrolled across the table. On it was the preliminary sketch he and Rozemyne had been working on for the Alexandrian entwickeln. The castle, modeled loosely after Ehrenfest’s, was situated in the top center. To its left were five feyplant research facilities and on its right were ones for feyfish and feybeasts as well as a feybeast enclosure. In the center of the city was the library, a massive structure that threatened to dwarf the castle, but nothing Ferdinand could say or do would convince his fiancée to make it any smaller. She, of course, had a point about it being the home for all the books printed in Yurgenschmidt, so he quickly stopped wasting energy arguing with her about it.</p><p>She wouldn’t budge on the placement, either, stating that both commoners and nobles needed to have access to the “crystallizations of knowledge” kept within. Never mind that commoners and nobles wouldn’t be comfortable frequenting the same establishment. She fully believed that like the dream world, people from every walk of life would come to accept the unusual system. “Besides,” she had argued, “most nobles will probably send retainers to retrieve their books. Those retainers will likely already be familiar with commoner merchants at the very least.”</p><p>Once again, Ferdinand had decided to let her have her way. Most likely, the problem would solve itself with commoners being both illiterate and too afraid to approach the building to begin with.</p><p>“Hey, Ferdinand,” Rozemyne said as she pointed to the library, “I would like to install hanging gardens outside the library.”</p><p>He was immediately intrigued. “Explain.”</p><p>Taking a scrap of paper from her pouch, she used a self-inking pen to make a quick sketch of a tiered structure with each level containing crude depictions of a variety of plants. The drawing itself lacked beauty, but the concept was exceptional.</p><p>“Fascinating,” he murmured as he studied the paper. “What would the purpose be?”</p><p>“Well, first, it would look pretty,” she said. “It would also offer more insulation for the library itself, and it would serve as another place for feyplant research so that… maybe… you would… come to the library… more often.” She looked away as her cheeks colored, twisting her fingers around each other.</p><p>So his fiancée wanted to be able to see him even while they were engrossed in their own activities. Adorable. When she had mentioned having his research facility and her library connected two years before, it seemed a sweet but nonsensical idea. This proposal, however, made much more sense.</p><p>He almost reached out for a lock of her hair but caught himself. The momentary pleasure wouldn’t be worth listening to Cornelius’s hypocrisy.</p><p>“Very well,” he said instead, adding notations to the preliminary blueprints and relishing his all-goddess’s smile. “We need to decide the placement of the temple.”</p><p>“Let’s put it here,” she said, pointing to a space on the far left of the paper. “I want it to be easy enough to get to but to leave enough space for us to expand the library or research facilities as needed.”</p><p>Ferdinand nodded and drew a box to indicate the temple. As he did so, Rozemyne drew several boxes between it and the other structures that she then crossed out. “What are you doing?” he asked, perturbed.</p><p>“Marking places I want to leave blank for future expansion,” she said.</p><p>He gave a brisk nod, his annoyance draining away. “Have you received any suggestions from your lower city associates?”</p><p>“They still have a lot to consider, but they said we should have several large inns and that the new Italian restaurant should be as close to the noble district as possible. Also, Frieda would like a large training facility for chefs. We’ve been discussing creating more restaurants with different themes, like [#%*+€£] or [%#~**+=].”</p><p>One of these days, he was going to have to get her to teach him that language of hers. “Explain.”</p><p>“Oh, um…” Warmth bloomed at his ear cuff, so he pulsed mana into it. Once they were connected, she covered her mouth and said, “They’re places from the dream world.”</p><p>“I gathered as much.”</p><p>“Well, I was thinking one could be based on… How to describe it? They have a lot of spicy food, but not everything is.”</p><p>Ferdinand grimaced. “So like Ahrensbach?”</p><p>“No,” she said, shaking her head, “but we’d probably import the spices from there. One of the most popular dishes they make is [?!*+]. You mix flour and lard to make really thin dough and then cook it on a flat surface. Then, you fill it with spiced meat, sour cream, pommes, lettuce, and sometimes top it with a spicy sauce.”</p><p>That sounded similar to food that already existed, though Rozemyne surely had a unique twist that would make it entirely novel. “And the other?”</p><p>“Oh, the dish they’re most known for is the [#%^^*+%+]! It’s very similar to the hamburg steak we’ve had before, but you cut a bun off fluffy bread in half and put it in the middle and top it with cheese, pomme, lettuce, and different sauces.”</p><p>“Is it spicy?”</p><p>“Not at all. It’s often served with cut potattofels that are fried in oil. I was also thinking of opening a [#*+&lt;&gt;] bakery. They would serve things like really flaky rolls, filled cookies made with nut flour and egg whites, little cakes, fluffy bread, and so forth.”</p><p>Nodding, Ferdinand drew locations for the four restaurants, chef training facility, five sizable inns, and the Merchant’s Guild. “I’m not certain where the river will be, but we’ll have paper-making facilities located along it. I’ll place the print shops in the manufacturing district. Once you downtown associates have more definitive answers, I can add more to the downtown area. Here.” He went to a shelf and grabbed some magic paper. “Start working on the library blueprints while I draw up the ones for the temple.”</p><p>“What?” she asked. “You’re letting me do it?”</p><p>He raised an eyebrow at her. “Of course. Who else knows the needs of a library better than you?”</p><p>Her smile had him hiding her in his sleeve. When Cornelius moved to protest, Matthias grabbed his shoulder and silenced him with a glare.</p><p>“Rozemyne!” he hissed. “Control your facial expression!”</p><p>“Sorry! You just made me so happy.”</p><p>“I understand, but there are others present.”</p><p>Rozemyne closed her eyes, took in several deep breaths, and relaxed her face to a more noble expression, allowing Ferdinand to lower his arm at last. She glided over to a seat at the far end of the table and happily got to work designing her library, giving Ferdinand enough peace and quiet to focus on the temple. Given the size of Alexandria, he decided to make the structure bigger than Ehrenfest’s with a separate room in the orphanage for the print workshop so the boys could use their basement for storage. He also added two sets of classrooms, one for commoners and one for nobles, freeing up the dining hall. Since priests and shrine maidens were now allowed to marry, he added a section of the temple for married couples, adding two rooms to each chamber for any children they might have. They would have the option to make their own living arrangements and commute if they wished, but he saw no reason not to offer them another option, especially since several might lack the financial support to acquire their own quarters.</p><p>Since grays were also permitted to marry, he went ahead and added a third building to the orphanage for those couples as well as married servants like Rozemyne’s chefs. After that, he added a spacious room between the commoner and noble sections of the temple so Rozemyne would have somewhere to meet with her downtown associates. There were several that she’d had to have discussions with who would not have been permitted within the castle, including Effa. He didn’t want to hinder her ability to have such important meetings.</p><p>Finally, he added Drewanchel plumbing to every part of the temple, though he included measures to stop intruders who tried to enter from the sewers, and wells right by the orphanage, the servant’s stairs in the noble section, and a couple of other locations. He wasn’t certain what the weather would be like in the winter, but he understood that trudging through snow with buckets of water was less than ideal. Hopefully, Johann and Zack could have hand pumps prepared for the temple and castle before long.</p><p>Rolling up the document, Ferdinand went to the common room where Melchior and Charlotte were receiving instruction. Wilfried was presumably outside with Eckhart.</p><p>He called Janrik over, who gave Melchior a few problems to work on in his absence. “Yes, my lord?”</p><p>Ferdinand passed him the blueprints. “Take these to Zahm in the temple. I want him, Fran, and Fritz to review them. Inform me of any suggestions they have. I will see to Melchior until you return.” Rozemyne would be working on her assignment for another bell or two at least and likely wouldn’t even notice his absence.</p><p>“Yes, my lord.”</p><p>Once Janrik left, Ferdinand went to his youngest nephew and looked over his work. He was using Rozemyne’s method for calculation, scratching numbers down on a slate before writing the answers on the reusable parchment he’d been provided. He was nearly as fast as his oldest sister despite being six years - actually seven years - her junior. “You seem to have a mind for numbers,” Ferdinand observed.</p><p>Melchior looked up with a sullen expression. “It’s a lot easier than memorizing prayers.”</p><p>“How far have you gotten on those?”</p><p>“I’ve got all the ones for the most common rituals and ceremonies memorized. I still need to learn the one for the healing ritual, Ewigeliebe’s prayer, and a couple of the other specialized ones like that. Sister told me to save them for last.”</p><p>Ferdinand nodded. “I would prioritize the healing ritual for now. It’s the season for trombes, and the prayer used to restore the gathering spot at the Academy on a regular basis now.” Though the trend had taken root in both weaves, he could hardly believe the words that were coming from his mouth. How was it that a sickly Devouring child had wrought such change throughout the entire country? One way or another, everything linked back to her. To think the insanity started with one poor child’s unquenchable thirst for books.</p><p>“Right!” Melchior said, his face brimming with determination. “I have to be ready for when I start at the Academy next year!”</p><p>“Hmm… Your math skills are satisfactory for an archduke candidate. How about your history?” He gave the boy an oral quiz, and to his mild surprise, Melchior answered every single one accurately. He was likewise able to answer questions on both first and second year content for geography and magecraft. His knowledge in theology stretched beyond what was taught in third year, though that hardly surprised Ferdinand. The boy was so dedicated to his religious studies that Ferdinand half expected him to eventually obtain more divine protections than Rozemyne.</p><p>“Very good,” Ferdinand said, bringing a bright smile to Melchior’s face. “How is your harspiel?”</p><p>He shook his head. “Nowhere near as good as my siblings.”</p><p>Ferdinand nodded his understanding and called Justus over from where he was tutoring Charlotte and told him to retrieve the child’s harspiel that Rozemyne used to practice with. Once done, Ferdinand passed it to Melchior and said, “Play.”</p><p>Gulping, Melchior adjusted the tuning and then performed one of the typical second year pieces, singing in a youthly soprano. He was a decent player and singer overall, certainly good enough not to bring shame to Ehrenfest, but listening to him was like watching Rozemyne fill a small feystone. He had the capacity to do so much more.</p><p>With a grunt, Ferdinand returned to the library where he found Rozemyne still pouring over her blueprints, as expected. He stepped around her retainers and retrieved some sheet music that he then presented to Melchior. “Practice this.”</p><p>“Now?”</p><p>Ferdinand raised an eyebrow, unwilling to waste any breath repeating himself.</p><p>“Yes, Uncle…” Melchoir’s retainer retrieved a stand from the other side of the room and set up the sheet music for his master. The boy started by looking it over, humming the melody to himself as he went. Then, he started again, this time moving his fingers to hold down the strings without strumming them. By the time he struck his first note, Janrik had returned, and he stood by with a soft smile as Ferdinand occasionally corrected Melchior’s posture or pointed out a wrong note. He quickly worked his way through the first page, his pace nearly matching Ferdinand’s own when he’d learned the song.</p><p><em>Music and numbers, hm?</em> Ferdinand thought as he watched Melchior sprint through the second page. The boy would make an excellent minister for Charlotte in the future, likely able to keep an eye on both the temple’s and castle’s budgets and catch any embezzlement before it got out of hand like it had under the current and previous aubs.</p><p>Melchior was ready to perform the piece within a bell, only making three mistakes despite having so little time to learn it. He was disappointed in himself for being unable to play it perfectly, but Ferdinand shook his head at him. “You did admirably considering the time you spent learning it. Most musicians make at least one mistake per performance. Tell me, do you enjoy music?”</p><p>“Yes!” he said, his eyes glittering. “It’s a wonderful way to praise the gods, and you can give out blessings if you pray sincerely. At least, that’s what Brother and Sister said happened to them.”</p><p>Fighting the urge to pinch the bridge of his nose and sigh, Ferdinand said, “While that is true, it is best to avoid giving blessings in that manner. In the temple or during an important performance is one thing, but you must refrain from doing it while playing during class at the Royal Academy. Understood?” The gods knew they didn’t need anymore Ehrenfest saints running around.</p><p>“Yes, Uncle.”</p><p>“Now, have you decided what course you will take?” he asked, wondering if he’d follow after Wilfried’s or Charlotte’s example.</p><p>“I’m going to take all three, just like you!” the boy beamed, causing Ferdinand to freeze in shock. “The temple was attacked during the invasion because of how important it is, right? I think it would be best to take the knight course so I can properly defend it when I become High Bishop. Also, you and Sister made children’s tools for the children with mana so that they could still become nobles. That’s why I want to take the scholar course. It takes a lot of mana to make those tools, so I don’t want to burden my scholars with it, but I still want to be able to provide them to future orphans or even nobles with sufficient mana who are too poor to afford one, just like you did. It really meant a lot to the kids in the temple to receive them. Many had given up any hope of entering noble society. They’re really thankful to you, Sister, and Father. Plus, with both you and Sister leaving with your retainers, Ehrenfest is going to need as many nobles as it can get!”</p><p>Justus’s snort of laughter pulled Ferdinand from his silent reverie. While his retainer held a hand over his mouth in an attempt to forestall any more outbursts, Charlotte gave her brother a worried smile. “You know that Uncle had to stay at the Academy nearly all the time once he entered his third year, right?”</p><p>“I know,” Melchior said. “I can spend four years at the Academy year round no problem if it means reaching my goals. I have to be able to do my part to support Ehrenfest. I can’t stay under my siblings’ cloaks forever!”</p><p>Placing a hand on her cheek, Charlotte sighed and said, “I don’t think anyone will accuse you of being under our cloaks. You’re set to surpass us thanks to receiving Sister’s learning materials at such a young age. You already had all the gods and their subordinates memorized long before your baptism.”</p><p>Ferdinand folded his arms and tapped his temple. “Melchior, while it’s a fine goal, taking all three courses is no simple feat. Keep in mind that you cannot show anything less than excellence.”</p><p>With a determined nod, Melchior declared, “I know! That’s why I’m working hard every day!”</p><p>“So long as you understand,” Ferdinand sighed. “Janrik, you may take over again.”</p><p>“Where are you going, Uncle?” Melchior asked, frowning in disappointment.</p><p>“To check on Rozemyne.”</p><p>“Ah, she’s alone in the library with no one but her retainers.”</p><p>“Indeed.” Ferdinand returned to where he left Rozemyne. She was putting the finishing touches on the hanging gardens outside the library when he approached.</p><p>“Ferdinand! Ferdinand!” she called, holding up the paper to him. “Isn’t it amazing? I was going to go with a circular library, but this rectangular design will actually allow us to store more books. And see here? This gap between the shelves and walls will help control humidity, so the librarians won’t have to use as much mana to keep the magic tool running.”</p><p>Raimund had already made the humidity-controlling magic tool extremely mana efficient, so depending on how effective that gap was, an archnoble could go anywhere from a month to a year without having to replenish it.</p><p>“It seems to be divided into two sections,” he observed.</p><p>“Yes,” she said. “Like the temple, there will be a commoner section and a noble section. We can have shumils help the commoners retrieve books so that they don’t have to interact with any nobles. Of course, we’ll have shumils for the nobles as well, but there will also be librarians on that side. I hope we’ll see many commoners patronizing the library once the temple school is up and running. That should help increase the literacy rate.”</p><p>He grunted his approval. “What are all these doors?” he asked, pointing to the back wall on the first floor.</p><p>“Those will function like the dormitory doors at the Royal Academy,” she said. “You explained a long time ago that I couldn’t have an ever-growing library, so when the collection outgrows this structure, the aub can build new ones elsewhere and connect them to one of the doors so that their contents can still be easily accessed. This one leads directly to the castle. You’ll need a key to open it. Oh, and this one at the end leads to the Underground Library, which you can see here.” She pointed to another part of the blueprint. “This is where we’ll keep sensitive materials. It will require permission from the aub to enter.”</p><p>“I see,” he said, tracing his finger over the lines on the parchment. “Is this the entrance to a hidden room?”</p><p>“Yes,” she said. “There are three. One is for me so that I can relax and read in my library. One is for you, and the third…”</p><p>Ferdinand’s ear cuff warmed, so he activated it. “What is the third one for?”</p><p>“...Us,” she said, casting her gaze down as a light blush dusted her cheeks. “We often have private conversations, so I thought if the need arose while we were at the library, rather than go back to the castle, we could just use a hidden room there.”</p><p>Furrowing his brows, Ferdinand asked, “Could we not just use one of the two registered to us?”</p><p>“This will let us have private spaces that no one else can enter. We can use them for times when we’re preparing gifts for each other or when we just need to be alone for a moment.”</p><p>“One would normally use their bedroom when they need space from their spouse.”</p><p>Rozemyne tilted her head in confusion. “But we’ll be sharing a bedroom.”</p><p>Ferdinand’s brain came to a halt.</p><p>“Oh, another [*&amp;$)@( &amp;*#@^%]. I’ll take this opportunity to explain, then.” She covered her mouth before she continued. “I used to sleep in the same bed with everyone, and I miss that closeness. Also, married couples almost always shared a bed in the dream world. I just thought… I mean, do you not want to?”</p><p>The look she was giving him was fatal. He would never be able to say no to that face. “That’s not it. It’s simply… There are more noble houses that don’t have that sort of arrangement than do. It… never occurred to me that you would want to sleep in the same bed with me.”</p><p>“Of course, I do!” she said, her voice carrying all the pout that her expression didn’t show. “From the night we bind our stars until we climb the towering staircase together!”</p><p>To his chagrin, he felt his ears heat at her words, and he glanced over to see Cornelius leveling a heavy stare at him. “I understand your wish,” he said. “However, there will be times we must sleep separately, such as during the Archduke Conference.”</p><p>“I refuse,” she said, her eyes narrowing into a glare. “You can come up to my room.”</p><p>“Men are not allowed on the third floor.”</p><p>“Then I’ll go down to yours!”</p><p>Ferdinand sighed and tapped at his temple. As much as her desire to be close to him made his heart soar, he couldn’t fathom a weave in which her retainers allowed either scenario to happen. “Rozemyne, be reasonable.”</p><p>“I’ll be Aub Alexandria once I graduate, right? I’ll simply issue a decree that the aub and their spouse can share a room at the Royal Academy if they so desire. Problem solved. Now, does my library meet your approval or not?”</p><p>He sighed again and decided to set aside the argument for now. It wouldn’t matter for another two years anyway. “I find no fault with the library.”</p><p>“Excellent!” she cried. “Then it can be built as soon as you dye–”</p><p>“Rozemyne,” Ferdinand interrupted her, “the castle takes priority, followed by the nobles’ quarter and then downtown.”</p><p>“Don’t worry,” she said. “I’m making plenty of gold dust so that we can take care of everything.”</p><p>Sighing, he pinched the bridge of his nose as a headache began to bloom around the sides of his head. “I told you to store mana, not make gold dust.”</p><p>“I’m doing both.”</p><p>“Do you understand just how much mana we will need for an entwickeln this large? Recall how much it took to create a simple sewer system. We also need to fill the land with mana so our people don’t starve.”</p><p>“How big of a fool must you think I am to assume I can’t grasp even that simple concept? I’ve been draining myself to near exhaustion since the Archduke Conference every single day. My scholars, however, are appreciative of the opportunity to create rejuvenation potions for me. Apparently, I haven’t been giving them enough brewing work. The retainers who are coming with me are also storing mana for the entwickeln. And don’t give me that look!” She shot him the same smile Florencia gave Sylvester when she was particularly upset. “We’ll be creating their estates, too, no? They agreed it’s only fair that they help out. We’ll also have Gervasio’s mana at our disposal for the next two seasons, and he has nearly as much as we do. While he fills the supply, we can focus on storing mana.”</p><p>“Very well,” he agreed. “However, stop making gold powder. We can easily dust filled feystones if necessary, but we can’t turn dust back into mana. Understood?”</p><p>“Fine,” she said before deactivating her ear cuff. “Do you have the plans for the castle already drawn up?”</p><p>Ferdinand walked to one of the bookshelves and pulled down yet another roll of parchment. “Preliminary sketches only. I want your input before I move forward.”</p><p>She gave him a grateful smile before she slid next to him to peer over the document, her shoulder a hair’s breadth from his. Somehow, he found the distance more tantalizing than actually holding her. Half of his mind was consumed with the desire to close the gap and contrived ways he could touch her without giving Cornelius the leeway to complain. Thankfully, creating the castle blueprints was simple enough since they were basing them on Ehrenfest’s that he didn’t need to employ all of his faculties.</p><p>Once they finalized those plans, they went back to the large sketch and began discussing the setup of the noble’s quarter. It was impossible to make any solid plans without knowing the population of the duchy nor the way the land was divided amongst giebes. They agreed, though, that the simplest way to handle giebedoms was to keep them as they were, though they would need to change the names of any that were associated with criminals who had been executed, including those who had invaded Ehrenfest. He was concerned about how those particular provinces were getting on after losing their giebes, but as he was unable to effect any change until summer, he’d kept the matter out of his mind by telling himself the people there had likely moved to neighboring provinces who still had someone supplying mana to the land.</p><p>Ferdinand sincerely hoped they had mana to spare after the entwickeln. Alexandria would be in desperate need of it.</p>

<p>Summer was approaching faster than Steifebrise, and Ferdinand still had so much to do. His most pressing concern was his meeting with the Zent where they would discuss the creation of the duchy foundation and temple. Rozemyne was permitted to join since Ferdinand was merely the relay aub. He brought with him Justus, Eckhart, and Janrik while she brought Elvira, Lieseleta, Gretia, Cornelius, Matthias, Laurenz, Damuel, Leonore, and Hartmut. Clarissa gnashed her teeth in envious regret as she watched her fiancé step onto the teleporter.</p><p>They were only going for a meeting and returning right after, so they didn’t need to bring any luggage or other personnel. It was such a short trip that most of their goodbyes were a single sentence.</p><p>Until Ferdinand got to Wilfried.</p><p>When he approached, the young man passed him a sound-blocking tool. Ferdinand took it with some trepidation.</p><p>“Uncle, can we talk privately when you return?”</p><p>Thinking over his schedule, he replied, “Tomorrow morning in my office.” Ferdinand had planned to go to his estate then and not return to the castle before his departure. If Wilfried felt the need to use a sound blocker just to ask for a meeting, it probably needed to take place in a hidden room. Ferdinand couldn’t invite the boy into the one at the estate with its two teleportation circles, so the next morning was the only opening he could give him.</p><p>Wilfried nodded. “Thank you. I’ll speak with you then.” Taking back the tool, he said, “Farewell, Uncle.”</p><p>“Yes,” Ferdinand replied somewhat absentmindedly, his faculties consumed with determining Wilfried’s purpose for the meeting.</p><p>Finished with his goodbyes, he escorted Rozemyne to the teleportation circle and whispered, “Close your eyes.”</p><p>“I know,” she said, a smile in her voice.</p><p>Gold and black swirled around them and then faded, leaving them in the teleportation room in the Ehrenfest dormitory.</p><p>“Professor Hirschur should have opened the tea party room for our royal escort,” Ferdinand said as they left the hall.</p><p>“Meaning they’re probably still waiting outside,” Rozemyne sighed.</p><p>To their surprise, however, four guard knights, two attendants, and a scholar, all wearing white capes, were in the room where they were supposed to be. It seemed even Hirschur couldn’t ignore Zent Werdekraf.</p><p>The scholar stood when they entered the room. “Aub Alexandria and Lady Rozemyne, I presume? I am Thaddeus, head scholar to the Zent. May I pray for a blessing in appreciation of this serendipitous meeting, ordained by the pure rivers flowing from Flutrane the Goddess of Water?”</p><p>“You may,” Ferdinand replied.</p><p>“O Flutrane, Goddess of Water. May you grant Aub Alexandria and Lady Rozemyne your blessing.” A small green light floated from the man’s ring towards them. Then, he, Ferdinand, and Rozemyne took a seat as tea was served. Thaddeus’s eyes lit up when he saw their new dessert, a cream-based dish called tiramisu. Rozemyne had lamented the lack of something called [coffee] and [chocolate], having to instead use ingredients from Dunkelfelger to provide the necessary bitter notes. While Rozemyne complained that it wasn’t the same as what she recalled from the dream world, everyone else who tried it found it delightful, Ferdinand included. Thaddeus’s expression suggested he felt the same when he tried a bite.</p><p>“I have been sent to review your blueprints for the temple and dormitory,” he said.</p><p>Ferdinand nodded to Justus, who handed over a thin box with the materials inside. By the time the poison checks were done, Thaddeus was working through his second serving of tiramisu. Setting down his fork, he took the sheets from the attendant and reviewed them. After asking a few clarifying questions, Thaddeus nodded his approval and passed them back to the attendant. “Prepare these to be delivered to the Zent.” Turning back to Ferdinand, he said, “Your dormitory is quite similar to Ehrenfest’s. Will your castle be modeled after theirs as well?”</p><p>“Familiarity inspires comfort,” Ferdinand replied with a sociable smile. “It will be some time yet before we have the resources to build it, however.”</p><p>Thaddeus blinked quickly twice, the only show of his surprise. “Dear me, I’m afraid Ordoschnelli has lost her way in all of the excitement recently. You will be provided with gold dust and mana enough to build your library, castle, walls, gates, noble district, and the first floor of your downtown area.”</p><p>Rozemyne’s jaw fell open slightly, and Ferdinand’s eyes widened in shock. Three of their retainers gasped, but he could forgive the slip up in the face of such news.</p><p>“With only two suppliers with a significant portion of your lands having lost their foundations, the Zent and First Queen determined that asking you to create your city on such short notice would be too much.”</p><p>“Is Corinzdaum being shown the same generosity?” Ferdinand asked. He didn’t want the added headache of inspiring jealousy in his neighbor.</p><p>Thaddeus nodded. “But of course! They are in the same situation as you, no?”</p><p>Rozemyne finally came out of her stupor to ask, “Forgive me, but how was the Zent able to provide so much gold dust and mana when the country’s foundation was in the state it was?”</p><p>“Only the gods can say,” he answered with a mysterious smile. “Though Dunkelfelger did provide a small portion as a show of goodwill to the new Zent.”</p><p>“How was Dunkelfelger able to give any mana when they, too, are managing an abandoned territory?”</p><p>Thaddeus’s smile stiffened but relaxed after a moment. “I suppose there is no reason to hide this from the Incarnation of Mestionora. The Zent redrew Dunkelfelger’s borderlines soon after he dyed the foundation. Supplying mana to what used to be Old Werkestock is much more efficient as a result.”</p><p>Ferdinand sighed internally and fought the urge to pinch the bridge of his nose. That meant the Ahrensbach portion of Werkestock was watching the other half become more vibrant all spring while they continued to suffer from a mana drought. True, their situation was not as dire in this weave compared to last thanks to the Lanzenavian transplants who were helping to supply that land directly, but there would still be a marked difference between the two, which would lead to resentment.</p><p>Well, it wasn’t all bad news. All the mana and gold dust he, Rozemyne, and their retainers had been stockpiling could be used for other purposes. Thaddeus hadn’t mentioned a sewer system for one thing, and they would be able to add more stories to the downtown area, allowing them to provide indoor plumbing to the commoners.</p><p>Ferdinand wished dearly he could see the look on Gunther’s face when he encountered a toilet for the first time. The thought nearly brought a smirk to his face.</p><p>His thoughts were interrupted by an ordonnanz landing on the scholar’s arm. “The Zent is ready to receive them now,” a cool, feminine voice said.</p><p>“Ah, it is time to depart, then. Oh, before I forget, the materials are ready to be taken as soon as your foundation is created,” Thaddeus said, his smirk seeming a touch smug. “Now, we shan’t keep the Zent waiting.” He stood and led the way out of the Ehrenfest dormitory and guided them down to the last door on the hall. The two attendants gave the group badges, allowing them to pass inside.</p><p>They entered a villa Ferdinand didn’t recognize. Given the amount of mana Werdekraf had been expending, he doubted it was a new structure. It had most likely been Trauerqual’s. The rooms were decorated after Dunkelfelger fashion - simple, clean, and stately. The only exception was a mural painted along the longest wall of the common room depicting a scene from a game of treasure-stealing ditter.</p><p>Behind him, Justus began to tremble, and Ferdinand followed his gaze to a certain spot towards the middle of the mural where a very familiar-looking man with light blue hair was sitting astride a lion highbeast, brandishing a water gun that was firing several arrows.</p><p>Ferdinand quickly looked away. Best not to think about it too much. Fortunately, it seemed no one else noticed as they were swiftly led into a meeting room where the Zent and First Queen waited. The group bowed and offered greetings before Ferdinand and Rozemyne took their seats. Tea was once again served, if for no other reason than the royal couple wanting to try their new dessert. Ferdinand forced his way through a few bites of the pound cake the Zent had provided. He’d had entirely too many sweets that day. At least the tea was his preferred blend.</p><p>“Ferdinand! Rozemyne!” the Zent bellowed. “It is good to see you again. Though it’s only been a couple of weeks, it feels as though we parted ways months ago. The anticipation for our ditter in three years is making the days unbearably long!”</p><p>“I am glad to know our ditter is giving the Zent more time to accomplish what must be a mountain of tasks,” Ferdinand replied.</p><p>Werdekraf snorted and turned to Rozemyne. He opened his mouth but paused, his eyes trained on an area that made Ferdinand bristle with rage.</p><p>“Rozemyne,” the Zent asked, his eyes narrowed, “why do you not wear your engagement stone rather than that courtship necklace?”</p><p>She tilted her head and replied, “Because we have not exchanged them yet. I won’t be fifteen until summer of next year.”</p><p>Werdekraf groaned as Sieglinde closed her eyes and sighed.</p><p>“Have we erred in some way?” Ferdinand asked, his anger still prickling at him.</p><p>“Ferdinand, Rozemyne,” Sieglinde said, looking each of them in the eye with the gaze that had likely censured the Zent on multiple occasions. “You will be moving to a new territory this winter. While it is true that it’s by the Zent’s decree, you have nothing tying you together but the approval of a former Zent with no Grutrissheit. Your bond needs to be as strong as possible before you leave Ehrenfest. Do you understand?”</p><p>Had Rozemyne lived in the previous weave, and she had chosen to stay with him, they would have exchanged feystones before the Archduke Conference so he could attend with her, but their circumstances were entirely different in this weave. He had wanted to wait until the summer or fall before her final year at the Academy. She would be of adult age in the eyes of the nobility, and Alexandria would likely be stable enough to invite their family to attend.</p><p>Alas, it seemed the gods were determined for it to happen before her fifth year.</p><p>“We understand,” Rozemyne answered, her pinky briefly brushing Ferdinand’s knee to let him know she didn’t take issue with the order. Cornelius’s eyes, however, shadowed with anger. Ferdinand briefly wondered what the young man would do if he found out his little sister had been mixing mana with him since the Archduke Conference ended.</p><p>At first, Rozemyne had been overwhelmed with embarrassment each time they tried, yanking her hand free mere moments after they touched, much to Ferdinand’s amusement. She was able to hold on for the length of time it took him to escort her from the front door of his estate to the library now, which was a marginal improvement. He highly doubted she would work up the nerve to kiss him before they went to Alexandria. That was preferable, though. After his gentlemen’s education with Sylvester, he feared what he would do now that he knew his… options if he had to endure a year of kissing her. Rozemyne was dripping with Efflorelume’s blessings, and Anwachs had taken inspiration from Geduldh when seeing to her growth. How could one taste such a goddess and not crave more?</p><p>Ferdinand was pulled from his thoughts as a sound barrier went up, and Zent Werdekraf took the blueprints from Thaddeus to review. “Hmm. Very well. This should be simple enough. I will go to the country foundation, redraw the borderlines, and then create your temple, the foundation, and the dormitory.” He held out his hand, and his scholar placed a scroll in it. Werdekraf unrolled it to reveal a map of the area that would be Alexandria. Five provinces were crossed out, and a glance confirmed they belonged to the giebes who had invaded Ehrenfest. Total, Ferdinand counted fifty-two provinces. Towards the border of what had been the Sovereignty and Old Werkestock, five provinces were circled. Numbers were written on all of the provinces with Werkestock averaging between 10-15 more than the Sovereignty provinces and Scharfer tending to be around 5-10 lower. Ferdinand could guess they represented the noble population, though he didn’t know how many of them were adults. Each province had either a blue or red dot as well with the Sovereignty having most of the latter. The Werkestock ones near the Ehrenfest border were all blue while those on the Dunkelfelger border were red. Those in between were mixed while Scharfer was largely blue.</p><p>“My scholars evaluated Alexandria. The numbers represent the population of each province.”</p><p>Rozemyne’s eyes widened. “That’s nearly quadruple what Ehrenfest has!”</p><p>Werdekraf gave her a strange look as Sieglinde raised an eyebrow, but he continued, “Indeed! Certainly enough for a decent ditter once things are stable. Now, the red dots are provinces that have acceptable levels of mana, though they may be on the cusp. The blue are suffering droughts.”</p><p>“There’s… a lot of blue,” Rozemyne said, covering her mouth and letting a touch of pity show through her noble mask.</p><p>“We expected as much,” Ferdinand said. “I’m surprised the number of red provinces is as high as it is.” The Lanzenavians must have nearly drained themselves dry pouring mana into the east side of Old Werkestock. It was a shame Georgine had intentionally neglected the ones on the Ehrenfest border to incite them to attack.</p><p>“Overall, sentiment in the abandoned territories is mostly positive, especially in Scharfer where they are suffering the most. The Sovereignty is evenly split between those who don’t want to lose their position and become part of a duchy and those who openly welcome the Incarnation of Mestionora who led a true Zent to the Grutrissheit. You may give the former the option to return to their original duchy if you would like.”</p><p>While Alexandria couldn’t afford to lose half the Sovereignty nobles, it would benefit them nothing to be torn from the inside by factional politics. He would discuss it with Rozemyne, but he thought letting them leave was the better choice.</p><p>“What is this?” Rozemyne asked as she pointed to five circled provinces.</p><p>“The location of your central district!” Werdekraf proudly announced. “The giebes happily agreed to take over these duchies that lost their leaders during the invasion, especially once we pointed out the trade route between Ehrenfest and Alexandria would pass right through them. We have given their land enough mana to survive until the middle of summer.”</p><p>Ferdinand narrowed his eyes and asked, “You had to fill the nearly-depleted country foundation. Where did you get this excess mana from?”</p><p>Werdekraf shrugged. “I asked Erwaermen. Since it was his order for me to become Zent and save his garden, I thought he would be able to help, and help he did! I was imbued with so much mana that I couldn’t seem to use it fast enough!” He bellowed a laugh as Ferdinand felt himself pale. The rest of the Zent’s words were nearly drowned out by the pounding in his ears. “Sadly, it only lasted a week. Ah, would that we could have dittered while the gods’ mana was still upon me! I would have been unstoppable! Not even you would have bested me!”</p><p>“Werdekraf.”</p><p>He froze when Sieglinde called his name.</p><p>As the Zent recovered, a warm hand wrapped around Ferdinand’s, which unbeknownst to him, had been clutching his robes at his knee. Relaxing his grip, he flipped his hand around and gave hers an appreciative squeeze as the pounding in his ears subsided.</p><p>
<em>She is here. She is alive. They didn’t take her from me.</em>
</p><p>“Regardless,” Werdekraf said, pulling Ferdinand’s attention back to him, “the mana was freely given to me to save Yurgenschmidt, so I freely give it to you to help in that endeavor! Now, once I finish your foundation, you and Rozemyne will travel to your new central district and create your new capital city!”</p><p>“Right now?” Rozemyne asked with a tight smile.</p><p>Sieglinde stepped in before Werdekraf could answer. “No. The option will be available to you starting this afternoon. We understand that you will need time to plan your noble district. I do suggest building the castle and walls as soon as possible, however.”</p><p>“Yes, you’ll need access to the supply room so that Lanzenavian king can serve his punishment,” Werdekraf agreed with a decisive nod. “Once the castle is built, I can make the teleportation circle to your dormitory. Until then, you’d have to travel back to Ehrenfest to come to the Academy if need be.”</p><p>Since they were given the mana and the gold dust, creating the castle and walls wouldn’t be a problem. Ferdinand would need blueprints for downtown, however, and unlike noble estates, commoner dwellings and businesses varied widely. If he wanted to include indoor plumbing, he would need detailed plans for each building, and the Gutenbergs wouldn’t be able to provide that on such notice. Not only that, Ferdinand had no idea what the commoners who already lived in those five provinces would need.</p><p>His thoughts came to a sudden halt, and he almost laughed at himself. Never would he have guessed that he would care about commoners to such an extent. What used to be a faceless entity, however, had been replaced with Gunther, Effa, Tuuli, and Kamil, and he wanted to do everything in his power to improve their lives after what he had done to their family.</p><p>“Now, let’s discuss the placement of your temple,” Werdekraf said, retrieving another map from his scholar, this one depicting the five provinces that would become the central district. It was covered in notations with several blue spots, dozens of large green squares, and countless red dots.</p><p>“Oh, I see,” Rozemyne said. “These squares are farms, the blue dots are noble housing, and the red dots are…commoners, if I had to guess.”</p><p>Sieglinde nodded, impressed. It was a simple feat, however, for anyone who had traveled the districts for Spring Prayer and the Harvest Festival.</p><p>The map showed three rivers flowing through the area and large swathes of forests, though several were probably sparse thanks to the mana shortage. The Sovereignty side had a much higher commoner population than the Werkestock side. While that spoke of the suffering the commoners endured in abandoned territories, it also meant there was more than enough unclaimed space to create a new city.</p><p>He found one such unpopulated area by one of the rivers in the Old Werkestock province of Weisenberg. “What do you think of here, Rozemyne?” he asked, pointing to it.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed as she stared at the map for a moment. “It’s right by a river and a couple of forests for gathering. There’s also room to expand in the future. I think it will work.”</p><p>“Very well. I need a map of this area.” </p><p>Werdekraf had the scholar who had surveyed that portion step forward and draw a map on a new sheet of paper. Ferdinand was under no illusions that it was perfect, but it was close enough for his purposes.</p><p>Once the scholar stepped away, Ferdinand took a self-inking pen from Justus and leaned over the table. First, he put faint marks where he planned to erect the city walls. To the western side of the city, he drew a rectangle and labeled <em>temple</em>.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Ferdinand had drawn the rough outline of where the castle would go, making note of how many people would be displaced, and he’d just found a clear space for his feybeast enclosure when Rozemyne’s finger tapped the spot in the center between the noble and commoner districts. “This is where the library will go,” she declared. “As the Wisdom of the Zent, the library should be the focal point of the duchy.”</p><p>“Do you mean ‘city’?” Ferdinand asked.</p><p>“I know what I said.”</p><p>With a sigh, he drew the rectangle where she indicated.</p><p>As he continued drawing structures, Rozemyne returned to the previous map of the five provinces and pointed to some of the blue dots. “These nobles are living quite close to commoners. Do you have their names by chance?”</p><p>“Why?” Ferdinand asked, narrowing his eyes at her.</p><p>“Because they could potentially act as intermediaries between commoner merchants and nobles. Clear communication is essential in establishing and maintaining an industry.”</p><p>That was true. They didn’t want what nearly happened in Groschel to take place in Alexandria.</p><p>Sieglinde looked over her shoulder at her scholar, who stepped into the sound barrier. After a brief conversation, the scholar went to a box to retrieve a few papers before going to a table and marking them. “My scholar will check on the names,” Sieglinde said, and Rozemyne offered her a grateful smile.</p><p>Once Ferdinand completed the map of the new capital city, Werdekraf reviewed it and frowned. "What are these large spaces with no label?"</p><p>"Areas set aside for the expansion of the library and research facilities."</p><p>The Zent's frown deepened. "Where is your ditter field?"</p><p>Ferdinand narrowed his eyes. "Why would we need a ditter field? We are not Dunkelfelger."</p><p>"How will you practice for our yearly match without a ditter field?! I finally have you bound by contract to play! I will not allow you to present a subpar showing because you lacked the means to practice and hone your duchy's skills!"</p><p>Queen Sieglinde made no move to reign in her husband, forcing Ferdinand to engage. "I see. You wish for our matches to end with the blessings of Stiefebrise."</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>"Have we not defeated you each time we met on the ditter field, even without practice or time to adequately prepare?"</p><p>Werdekraf snorted, his eyes aflame. "Ah, but you have not faced <em>the Zent,</em> have you? I do not wish to besmirch your reputation in front of your new duchy by destroying you with the new resources I have access to. Would our first match not be after Rozemyne is set to become Aub Alexandria? You would allow her first act as Aub to be to lose a ditter match because you failed to adequately prepare your people?"</p><p>"While I understand your reasoning, I do not recall your scholar saying you provided the mana or gold dust for a ditter field."</p><p>"Ever the schemer," Werdekraf said with a dark smirk. "Truly, you are the Lord of Evil. Very well! I shall give you what you want."</p><p>Ferdinand fought the urge to click his tongue. He'd been hoping the Zent had exhausted himself. Still, suffering the presence of a ditter field was a small price to pay for the mana and gold dust he was receiving. Taking back the map, he expanded the walls around the noble district and added the structure.</p><p>“Excellent!” Werdekraf cried. “If you are satisfied, we will move forward with these plans.”</p><p><em>If you wanted me to be satisfied, you wouldn't have made me waste space on a damned ditter field,</em> Ferdinand thought, but he kept his expression blank as he and Rozemyne nodded.</p><p>“Ah, what a decisive pair you are! As one would expect! Now, what color will your capes be?” Werdekraf asked. “I’ll need to make the bible key to match.”</p><p>“The dark blue of the blessing of the God of Darkness,” Ferdinand said, wishing he could take a lock of that beautiful hair between his fingers. He settled for gazing at it instead. Though Rozemyne’s expression didn’t change, her cheeks took on a pink hue.</p><p>Sieglinde gave them a rare indulgent smile. “I must confess, I am looking forward to the next volume of <em>A Mentor’s Love Story.</em> I pray Dregarnuhr weaves swiftly so that Grammaratur may bestow her blessings.”</p><p>Rozemyne’s entire face flushed red, and a glance over Ferdinand’s shoulder proved Justus was struggling to contain his laughter. Sighing, Ferdinand faced forward again and tapped his finger against his knee in annoyance. He knew Elvira would write a story about him and Rozemyne. There was no avoiding that, not even in the previous weave when there was no love to speak of until right before the very end. However, how was she able to tease out <em>volumes</em> when neither of them had done anything worth writing about? Surely three quarters of the text was completely made up.</p><p>Werdekraf studied Rozemyne and then nodded. “A fitting color for the Zent’s Wisdom! As one would expect! Now, do you have a crest to incorporate into the dormitory?”</p><p>Ferdinand motioned to Justus, who passed a piece of parchment to Thaddeus. After undergoing poison checks, it was handed to the Zent. “I see,” he said, rubbing his chin. “Shumils and a book. Yet another fitting decision! I believe that is all I need! Wait here. I will return shortly.”</p><p>With that, Werdekraf left, and Sieglinde had the sound barrier deactivated. “Rozemyne,” the Queen said, “you will not have long to acquire a dress for your engagement ceremony. Do you have a plan?”</p><p>Placing a hand on her cheek, Rozemyne replied, “In truth, my mothers and I have discussed my dress on a number of occasions, so we already have a preliminary design. Obtaining the cloth in time may prove challenging, but Kunstzeal and Steifebrise will guide my seamstress’s hands, as always.”</p><p>“They did a wonderful job on the dress you wore to the Archduke Conference,” Sieglinde said. “I look forward to hearing about it.”</p><p>Rozemyne smiled politely and took a sip of tea.</p><p>“Ferdinand,” Sieglinde said, turning to him, “you will be leaving for Alexandria soon, no? I worry you will not have adequate staff as your entourage has always been… selective.”</p><p>“One of Rozemyne’s scholars is coming with me and two more will join me after the Starbind Ceremony.” Anneliese was still nursing, but she had decided to stay by her husband’s side rather than wait in Ehrenfest. While she wouldn’t be able to move about, there would be plenty of work she could do while she stayed with her baby and Bertram. Ferdinand and Rozemyne both had tried to dissuade her, given the dangers she would face, but she would not be swayed, and truthfully, Ferdinand needed the assistance.</p><p>“For a total of four? For a duchy?” Sieglinde asked, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>“It is important to have retainers you trust when stepping under Verbergen’s shroud.”</p><p>The Queen flicked a hand, and her attendant stepped forward to pass Hartmut some documents. Once they were inspected, he handed them to Rozemyne, who held it so Ferdinand could read along with her. On the paper was a list of names with status, course, faction, age, work history, and so forth. A few had marks next to them.</p><p>“The people listed on the first two pages are from the portion of your lands that belonged to the Sovereignty,” she explained. “We have investigated and interviewed several nobles who would become part of Alexandria. These are the ones we would recommend you take into your service, and the ones with marks by their names are the nobles you wanted identified, Rozemyne.</p><p>“Most on the first two pages belong to the faction who are accepting of your rule while some are from the opposing faction but pose no danger beyond a general dislike of their new circumstances. However, it is important to have representation from all factions. Page three contains nobles from Werkestock while the fourth is the list from Scharfer. You do not need to take them all, but if you will allow me to play Anhaltung, I suggest you have no less than thirty scholars working in the castle and take at least ten more as retainers. You will need just as many attendants to ensure the castle can function. As for guard knights, I would take every single one on the list and hunt for more.”</p><p>Ferdinand nodded, having experienced the workings of both Ehrenfest's and Ahrensbach’s castles. Provided they could all pass through the Shield of Schutzaria, he would employ them and then pick his retainers as he observed their work.</p><p>“What are the fifth and sixth pages?” Rozemyne asked.</p><p>“Students at the Academy,” Sieglinde answered, taking another sip of her tea. “They would make excellent retainers for you. You should at least consider taking more female guard knights that are in their third to fifth years so that you will be adequately protected. The seventh page is a list of scholars who have shown promise as writers.”</p><p>“I’ll take–!”</p><p>Ferdinand clamped his hand down on hers and shot her a dazzling smile, causing her to swallow the rest of her words. “We thank you for your generosity,” he said, releasing Rozemyne so they could cross their arms and bow to the Queen. “We will heed Anhaltung.”</p><p>She nodded with satisfaction and allowed them a few moments to review the pages before Ferdinand passed them to Justus to be analyzed in depth later.</p><p>“Forgive me, Queen Sieglinde,” Rozemyne said, “but may I ask a question?”</p><p>“You may.”</p><p>“Did your scholars learn anything of the commoners in our new lands? Perhaps a guess at population or what industries they have?”</p><p>The Queen looked to her scholar who stepped forward and whispered into her ear. “We know little about the commoners. We can determine their population when the medals are moved, but as for workshops and the like, we only know of the few the scholars happened to notice.” They were, of course, the typical establishments - a Merchant’s Guild, fabric and clothing stores, and those that sold goods they obtained from Ehrenfest. The abandoned lands hadn’t benefited from interduchy trade, but it seemed they at least had workshops of some sort as well as the types of stores found in Ehrenfest before Rozemyne went on her first rampage.</p><p>From there, the conversation moved to the printing industry, with Rozemyne giving a general description of her plans and Sieglinde offering updates she’d received from Dunkelfelger about their progress. Ferdinand gave his input when asked, but by and large, he sat back and enjoyed watching Rozemyne socialize with the Queen as though she had been born Elvira’s daughter.</p><p>Blessed by Efflorelume, Anwachs, Mestionora, and Grammaratur. His fiancée truly was beloved by the gods.</p><p>Before too long, Werdekraf returned, carrying a bible and looking like he’d just finished an intense ditter. “Come, Ferdinand!” he bellowed. “Accept your divine treasure and face your destiny as Aub Alexandria!”</p><p>Gritting his teeth, he stood and dropped to a knee before the Zent. With the utmost care, Werdekraf presented the bible and its key to him before striking a powerful prayer pose.</p><p>“O mighty King and Queen of the endless skies...</p><p>“O Mighty Eternal Five who rule the mortal realm, O Goddess of Water Flutrane, O God of Fire Leidenschaft, O Goddess of Wind Schutzaria, O Goddess of Earth Geduldh, O God of Life Ewigeliebe...</p><p>“Hear my prayer and graciously lend your blessings. May your divine protection be granted to Ferdinand so that he might lead his people with your wisdom and strength. Grant him the power to protect this garden.”</p><p>A multi-colored blessing shot from the Zent’s ring and rained over Ferdinand. While it was nowhere near as impressive as Rozemyne’s, it was still shocking to witness. Never in either weave would he have thought to find himself receiving an all-element blessing from the ditter-head aub whom he decided to make Zent in a moment of panic.</p><p>“It seems Dregarnuhr the Goddess of Time has woven today's threads with exceptional speed and grace. I pray our threads cross again soon, hopefully on a ditter field.”</p><p>Ferdinand gave a not committal nod and then escorted his fiancée from the room.</p>

<p>When Ferdinand and Rozemyne reached the dormitory, an ordonnanz from Thaddeus informed them that their supplies would arrive within a bell. Rozemyne immediately ordered Hartmut to return to Ehrenfest to request assistance with transporting the unexpected luggage. It was certainly needed. Over half the tea room had been filled with boxes packed with feystones and bags of gold powder. All of them stared in awe at the sight.</p><p>“And Corinzdaum got just as much…?” Janrik asked in disbelief.</p><p>Damuel shook his head, his mouth hanging open. “I can’t even fathom the amount of mana I’m seeing right now.”</p><p>Rozemyne gave Ferdinand a silent look that said, <em>So this was why the other Rozemyne climbed the towering staircase.</em></p><p>He gave her an imperceptible nod.</p><p>Because of the value of the materials and the fact it belonged to Alexandria, not Ehrenfest, Ferdinand, Eckhart, Laurenz, and Damuel remained in the dormitory to supervise the transfer from that end while the rest of Rozemyne’s guard knights along with both their scholars watched from Ehrenfest’s side. The boxes were carried directly from the tea party room to the castle where they were placed on paper transfer circles to be sent to the landing area where Rozemyne waited with her highbeast. Far too soon, they ran out of magic paper they were willing to expend, so Charlotte offered to make her ride-in highbeast as big as the castle hallways and doors would allow to expedite the process. Natalie rode in the front with Charlotte while Angelica and Clarissa stayed in the back to manage the cargo.</p><p>This, according to Justus, made Wilfried envious as he wanted to be able to help his sister as well. However, the boy had a sensible highbeast, even if it was heavily ornamented, so he could only stand by and watch with his parents and little brother.</p><p>When the last of the boxes were taken from the tea party room, Ferdinand took a moment to stand in the common room and gaze at the dormitory. It had changed in some ways since he was a student, but he could still clearly remember walking through these halls for the six years he attended as a student, consumed with anxiety and stress from having to remain hyper vigilant within these walls. There were the attempted poisonings, various forms of harassment, and constant threats during the regular term along with a slew of other bad memories.</p><p>However, whenever he arrived at these dorms as a child, he’d always have a sense of relief wash over him. Every moment spent here was a moment Veronica couldn’t appear.</p><p>The dorms also held his happiest childhood memories of those six nights he spent in the aub’s room on the second floor with his father. This was the place, too, where the previous Rozemyne had gone out of her way to make him feel as comfortable as possible when Detlinde graduated and had welcomed him home despite his leaving for Ahrensbach. This very room was where Wilfried and Charlotte had begged for his praise as though it had mattered to them. He regretted that he wouldn’t have the same experience with Melchior as this would likely be the last time he would ever stand in the common room of Ehrenfest’s dormitory.</p><p>Glancing back to the tea party room, he recalled the last time he’d entered it in the previous weave. At that time, he’d been treated as an outsider with only Rozemyne welcoming him as family. He had a feeling this time, however, when they came to visit, things would be different.</p><p>Eventually, he nodded to Eckhart, Damuel, and Laurenz who were waiting silently. For the last time, Ferdinand headed to the teleportation hall, trying to leave the pain of his darker memories behind as he held the ones he cherished close to his breast.</p><p>When he arrived back at the castle, he was greeted with bemused smiles.</p><p>“You, uh, came back with a lot of gifts,” Sylvester said.</p><p>“Materials for Alexandria,” Ferdinand explained as he watched the attendants and knights load the last of the boxes into the back of Charlotte’s highbeast. “If you will excuse me, I need to see them safely to my estate.”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>He followed the pale red lion highbeast down the halls, remembering when Rozemyne had to use hers to move about the castle. It was amazing just how much having a healthy body had changed her pattern in the weave.</p><p>Once they arrived at the landing area and moved over the boxes, Rozemyne approached Ferdinand and asked with pink cheeks, “Will you ride my highbeast with me?”</p><p>Ordinarily, he would have declined, but since they were about to be separated for an entire season, he steeled himself and gave her a brisk nod, bringing a radiant smile to her face for a brief moment. Sliding into the front seat, he realized he’d never entered Lessy in this weave. This was not at all what he had pictured when he’d imagined them riding the same highbeast as a couple for the first time. He resolved to change things for their second.</p><p>Eckhart and Cornelius sat in the back seat, the former looking around and nodding his approval and saying, “This is quite comfortable. Truly worthy of Lord Ferdinand’s fiancée and my little sister.”</p><p>Ferdinand didn’t bother to question why her engagement came before their relationship as family.</p><p>Cornelius, meanwhile, kept his narrowed eyes on him, occasionally glancing out of the window for signs of danger. What he thought Ferdinand would attempt in the few moments it took to get to his estate with others in the highbeast was beyond him.</p><p><em>He’d better not be this bothersome after our starknot,</em> he thought. After spending two lifetimes wanting to know the love of a family, he absolutely would not tolerate anyone getting between him and his all goddess once they were bound.</p><p>When they landed, Lasfam opened the door to his estate, and he and Janrik directed the knights on where to place the boxes while Justus checked them all. It took up far too much room, but it wouldn’t be there for long.</p><p>As they were unloading, Ferdinand pulled Rozemyne to the side. “I had planned on using carriages to take my luggage to Alexandria, but I cannot trust such valuable materials to something so easily attacked. I am loathe to ask, but would you transport the feystones and gold dust to Alexandria?”</p><p>She gave him a sad yet understanding smile as she answered, “You don’t have to ask, Ferdinand. Of course, I will. I’ll take all your luggage as well.”</p><p>Frowning, he tapped the side of his head as he tried to work out the new schedule. “The Gutenbergs who are installing the doors and windows in the rooms we’ll be using at the temple have already left. I had planned to fly to the south of Ehrenfest, stay in one of the Leisegang estates for the night, and then go straight to the new temple. I wouldn’t feel comfortable staying anywhere with so much gold dust and mana with us. To travel the entire way in one trip, though…”</p><p>“That won’t be a problem, will it?” Rozemyne asked, tilting her head. “Can’t we do what we did at the Goddess’s Bath? I’ll make Lessy big enough for us to sleep in so that we can stay with the materials.”</p><p>“Rozemyne, you…!” Ferdinand gasped before he caught himself and put his noble mask back in place. “You do recall only the women stayed in your highbeast, correct?”</p><p>She nodded. “Yes, but I have a lot more mana now. I can make Lessy like a portable house. We can have our own rooms, and if any of our retainers get tired while traveling, they can rest in Lessy until they’re able to form their highbeast again.”</p><p>His ear cuff warmed, and he activated to hear her say, “I can make our rooms connected, too, through a secret passage.”</p><p>He shook his head. “Absolutely not! Our retainers could enter our rooms at any time. I will not give them any cause to question your chastity.”</p><p>Puffing her cheeks slightly, she said, “I’ll want to say goodbye to you, though.”</p><p>“Then plan to stay at the temple for a night, create a hidden room in the High Bishop’s chambers, and help me connect it to mine.”</p><p>Her eyes lit up as she agreed to his shameless plan. Part of him couldn’t believe he suggested it, but he, too, wanted some time alone with her before they had to part. The upcoming season would be hell, and he wanted to soak up as much of her as he could before he had to face it alone.</p><p>“If we’re doing this in one trip,” he said, “then we’ll leave in five days.”</p><p>“That would be too hard on our guard knights,” Rozemyne said, shaking her head. “We should plan to spend at least two nights in Lessy to give them time to rest. Damuel will have to ride with me the entire way as it is.”</p><p>Sighing, Ferdinand relented. “Fine, but that means we’ll have to leave in three days. Will you be able to prepare in time?”</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>“Very well. The Zent will come to the temple to create the divine instruments the day after we arrive.”</p><p>“Oh?” she asked, tilting her head in the other direction. “I think I’ll stay for that as well, then. I want to stay to bring my Gutenbergs back as well, but I simply have too much to do here with the hand off. Oh! But I can bring the gray priests who are planning to come!”</p><p>Ferdinand shook his head. “Not until we’re both there to ensure their protection.”</p><p>“What if I come at the end of summer to take back your luggage? They can ride back with me then. You know it would be helpful to have more hands.”</p><p>Grumbling, he agreed but said, “It would have been better for them to travel with the Gutenbergs and my chef…”</p><p>She giggled at him but then gasped, her eyes widening slightly as she remembered something. “Will Zahm be coming as a gray priest or as a commoner servant?”</p><p>“Priest,” Ferdinand answered. “I planned to purchase him at the end of fall so that he could assist with the hand off.”</p><p>Her eyes and smile warmed. “As always, your kindness is roundabout. Just admit you want him to spend as much time with the other gray robes as possible.”</p><p>“Nonsense,” he denied, turning away from her. “Go inform Lieseleta about your departure. You’ll want to contact the temple as well if you plan to bring any priests with you.”</p><p>She giggled as she said, “As my lord commands,” before deactivating the ear cuff and stepping away to send her ordonnanzes and speak with Hartmut.</p><p>He sighed to himself as he watched her leave. It seemed she was determined to disrupt all of his plans, no matter the weave.</p><p> </p><p>The next morning, Janrik announced Wilfried’s arrival at Ferdinand’s office. “There will be no need for tea,” Ferdinand told his attendant as he led the boy to his hidden room. Once inside, he gestured for him to sit.</p><p>Wilfried’s eyes wandered about the room until they landed on a tall object covered in black cloth. He was polite enough not to ask about it, however, and took a seat. “Whoa!” Wilfried gasped as he pushed against the cushioned bottom. “What is this?!”</p><p>“One of Rozemyne’s inventions,” Ferdinand answered blithely.</p><p>“What?! Why have you kept it a secret? This is amazing!”</p><p>“Because it takes quite a while to make a single chair, and the Gutenbergs haven’t the time to take orders for bouncy furniture from the entire archducal family. Fear not, however. My understanding is that someone trained in making them is remaining in Ehrenfest. Perhaps you can speak to Rozemyne about it. Now, what is it you wished to discuss?”</p><p>Wilfried’s face became serious. “Right. Uncle, I’m worried you’re going to take advantage of Rozemyne when you both go to Alexandria.”</p><p>Ferdinand made his expression carefully blank as he responded in the tone reserved for giving orders, “You must think little of me if you dare to accuse me of trying to summon winter before the arrival of autumn.”</p><p>“Huh?” he asked, staring at him in bewilderment before his eyes widened with horror. “No! That’s not what I meant! Gah! Charlotte would’ve worded this so much better!” He held the sides of his head and groaned. “I’m talking about the Book of Mestionora.”</p><p>Ferdinand froze.</p><p>“I know you have a copy, but you made Rozemyne do everything when we went to Ahrensbach’s aid. Don’t do the same thing in Alexandria. She may have a lot of mana, but you can’t make her do it all on her own.”</p><p>After a moment, Ferdinand folded his hands in his lap and crossed his legs. “I see. And what makes you so certain I have the book?”</p><p>Wilfried shrugged. “Because I know you.”</p><p>That was all the evidence he had to support such a bold claim and confront him? It rankled Ferdinand that he couldn’t refute it.</p><p>“There is no country gate in Alexandria,” Ferdinand said, “so Rozemyne shouldn’t have any need to use the book the way she did for Ahrensbach.”</p><p>Wilfried narrowed his eyes at him for a moment but slowly nodded. “Well, I guess that’s as good as I could expect.”</p><p>Sharpening his gaze, Ferdinand continued, “You will not tell anyone of your suspicions.”</p><p>“Huh? Of course not. I may not be as smart as you or my siblings, but I’m not a complete idiot. Even I can figure out that’s a one-way trip up the towering staircase.”</p><p>Well, it seemed the boy could finally connect cause and effect, a skill he never seemed to develop in the previous weave. Leopold deserved some praise.</p><p>“Um… That was all I wanted to say,” Wilfried said, rubbing the back of his neck. “I kind of expected you to spend a bell lecturing me.”</p><p>“I can if you would like.”</p><p>“No thanks.”</p><p>Ferdinand smirked at him but then grew serious. “There is something I wished to discuss with you as well. I had planned to wait until fall, but this is as good a time as any.”</p><p>Wilfried sat up straighter.</p><p>“Wilfried, this estate was a gift from my father,” he said. “I have cherished it.”</p><p>For some reason, the boy’s cheeks began to color. Well, Ferdinand supposed this was the first time he’d said anything personal to him.</p><p>“Once I leave Ehrenfest,” he continued, “I will give it to you.”</p><p>Wilfried’s eyes widened.</p><p>“There is room enough for both your wives and the children you will have. It is close to the castle, so you will have no issues performing your duties as knight commander, and you will always be close by if anything were to happen.”</p><p>Blinking slowly, Wilfried said, “Uncle… I was raised by the woman who made your life miserable. Wouldn’t you prefer to give this estate to Melchior or… Or literally anyone else?”</p><p>Ferdinand allowed himself to show a hint of the pain he felt whenever Sylvester’s mother was brought up in conversation. This was a hidden room, after all. “You likely know how I feel about Veronica, but Wilfried, you are not her.” It was a lesson that had taken him two weaves to fully learn. “You’re strong and capable. You’re willing to trust others, and you’re able to inspire and unite them. Ever since Rozemyne went into her jureve, you’ve strived to the best of your ability and earned both respect and accolades for your efforts. Through it all, you’ve maintained your kind disposition. I do not believe you capable of showing the same viciousness to a child that she showed to me. You are your own person, someone capable of becoming an exceptional knight commander, and I see you as such.”</p><p>Throughout the explanation, Wilfried’s nose and eyes gradually reddened. He made a valiant effort, but at the end, a stray tear managed to fall, finally breaking the boy’s resolve. He looked at the floor as a sob scraped through his lips before he covered his mouth to hold back the rest.</p><p>Ferdinand sat frozen, unsure what to do. How did one calm a crying fourteen-year-old boy? He wasn’t even sure what he’d said to inspire his tears. Had it hurt him that much to hear Veronica called vicious? Surely he’d endured worse. If it were Rozemyne, he would have pulled her into a hug, but he wasn’t about to offer the same to the boy. He recalled the time he’d shamefully cried in front of his brother after Rozemyne went into her second jureve and how Sylvester had comforted him.</p><p>Awkwardly, he stood and placed a hand on Wilfried’s shoulder.</p><p>The startled boy looked up at him, but Ferdinand refused to meet his gaze.</p><p>After what seemed an eternity, Wilfried got his sobs under control enough to speak, which allowed Ferdinand to take a seat again. “U-Uncle,” he said, still facing the floor, “allow me to be selfish while we’re in this room. I… I don’t want you to go!” Another sob ripped through him as Ferdinand’s eyes widened. “I know you have to, but I wish you could stay. I wanted to be vice commander under you and hunt the Lord of Winter with you. I wanted you to keep tutoring me and praise me for getting first-in-class in the knight course for my fifth and sixth years. It’s not fair! You’re an archduke candidate! You’re supposed to stay in Ehrenfest with us! With Charlotte becoming Aub, all of my family was supposed to stay with me!” He scrubbed his forearm across his eyes. “It’s… It’s not fair…”</p><p>Ferdinand stared at him, his jaw hanging open slightly as his mind went blank. Never had he considered Wilfried actually <em>wanted</em> to spend time with him. After finding out the gewinnen games were a means to learn tactics for bride-stealing ditter, he’d assumed any interactions with him had ulterior motives. Not only that, he truly considered Ferdinand to be family, not just someone who shared blood with his father.</p><p>“Wilfried…”</p><p>The boy shook his head. “You don’t have to say anything. I know I’m being childish and selfish. Besides, you already said enough.” He gave him an open, honest grin. “Thank you for trusting me with something so important to you. I can’t express what that means to me.”</p><p>In return, Ferdinand showed him a true smile.</p><p>They sat in comfortable silence for a bit before Wilfried stirred. “I need to go to the training grounds,” he said, “but… um… Can I ask a favor?”</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“Can you, um, heal my face?”</p><p>With a snort, Ferdinand leaned forward and prayed for Heilschmerz’s blessing for his nephew.</p>

<h3 class="landmark heading" id="work">Chapter Text</h3>
<p>Ferdinand sighed as he watched a veritable sea of people load boxes and furniture into a storage room in Rozemyne’s mansion-sized highbeast. He was bringing so much more than he’d planned, both in personnel and luggage. Naturally, all of Rozemyne’s adult retainers along with her namesworn were accompanying her for the journey, including Hartmut. Once again, Clarissa was being left behind, which she was reportedly not taking well.</p><p>In addition, the gray-robed priests who would eventually join them in Alexandria, wearing commoner clothes, were moving amongst the retainers as they helped load. However, they weren’t the only additions. Rozemyne had somehow managed to wrangle Benno, Otto, Mark, Lutz, and one of Frieda’s older brothers into the mix. Her reasoning was sound - they would be able to provide blueprints for the downtown area faster if they could see what they were working with. As Ferdinand and Rozemyne wanted to get their industries running as soon as possible, he wanted input on at least the main guilds and perhaps a couple of housing complexes. Commoners would likely start looking to move to the capital city sooner rather than later, and they would need somewhere to live and set up shop.</p><p>This only increased the amount of luggage they had to bring. It was far worse than when they’d visited Dunkelfelger or Drewanchel since everyone had to bring their own furniture. Ferdinand refused to entertain the idea of Rozemyne maintaining her highbeast for the entire trip to give everyone a place to sleep even once they arrived in Alexandria. Not only was it a waste of mana, but it would eliminate the need for her to stay in the High Bishop’s chambers, thus preventing them from meeting in their connected hidden rooms.</p><p>The downside was that Ferdinand wasn’t sure if the Gutenbergs had brought enough doors and windows to accommodate the extra guests. The commoners had brought curtains to place over the doorways for privacy just in case, but that was an extreme measure that Ferdinand found distasteful. Still, he had allowed Rozemyne’s rampage, so he had to live with the results. He heard Benno complaining about the short notice when he thought no one could hear him, but he’d worked with the man long enough to recognize the spark in his eye when he smelled an opportunity to profit.</p><p>At least Ferdinand had prevented Rozemyne from finagling her family into this. She’d tried to claim that getting the opinions of a soldier and dyer were necessary, but he refused to make Effa stay in a room without any furniture and only a curtain to protect her at night. Truly, once she started a rampage, she became blind to any and all details.</p><p>A loud gasp pulled his attention from the activity surrounding Lessy, and he turned to find Rozemyne rushing as fast as Elvira’s training would allow her towards Anneliese, who was sliding off Janrik’s highbeast, her infant in her arms. Behind them, Matthias was helping Bertram down from his. The young parents both looked slightly overwhelmed as Rozemyne began cooing over their baby, but then their expressions softened with warm smiles. Ferdinand made his way over, ready to scold her for displaying her emotions so openly, but to his surprise, she had maintained a noble countenance. He was certain that, had it been Tuuli’s or Charlotte’s child, her smile would have put the Goddess of Light to shame. Well, despite holding Anneliese’s name, her closeness with the two retainers was hardly comparable to that of her sisters.</p><p>“Ferdinand!” she said when she noticed him. “Look! Doesn’t he look just like Janrik? He even has the same hair and eye color! How cute!” Then, she turned back to the baby and whispered, “Be sure not to let Uncle Justus corrupt you with his weird hobbies, especially with how pretty you are.”</p><p>Anneliese raised a questioning eyebrow at her husband who shrugged.</p><p>“Rozemyne,” Ferdinand said, placing a hand on her shoulder, “we shouldn’t hold up our retainers any longer.”</p><p>“Oh, yes, my apologies,” she said before allowing him to escort her back to her highbeast.</p><p>Eventually, the last of luggage was loaded, and as Ferdinand gave Lasfam final instructions, Rozemyne began directing the commoners and gray robes to find seats in two of the rooms in the back of the first floor while the nobles who were riding with her, including their scholars, attendants, and two of her guard knights, took rooms on the second. Damuel and Cornelius, meanwhile, joined her in the “cabin,” a separate compartment meant for the driver and a couple of guard knights. Once they were settled in, Rozemyne climbed into her seat, gave Ferdinand a nod, and followed him as he took to the skies towards Alexandria.</p><p>Movement caught his eye, and he looked down to see Sylvester, Florencia, Charlotte, Wilfried, Melchior, Karstedt, Elvira, and Lamprecht waving goodbye. As he waved back, he used the ear cuff to alert Rozemyne of their presence, and she leaned out of the window to say goodbye. He’d already given his partings earlier that morning and late last night, but it filled his chest with warmth to see his family come out to see him and his fiancée off.</p><p>Last time he left Ehrenfest, snow had blanketed the ground, covering everything in silence and death, just like Ahrensbach would cover him. Sylvester had shown the care he was allowed given his position, but he still felt the connection they had thin to the point of breaking when he turned to face his end. Perhaps it was because he knew he was coming back, however briefly, that the same was not true this time.</p><p>It struck him that last time, too, Rozemyne had carried his luggage for him, though only as far as the duchy border. She’d been so worried about him finding happiness for himself, even threatening to make an enemy of the king for his sake, but he’d thrown away the possibility of finding anything but a miserable climb up the towering staircase. This time, however, he didn’t need to find happiness. It was following him in a ridiculous, gargantuan highbeast.</p><p>They traveled through the late morning, landing in Garduhn by lunch. The nobles, Ferdinand included, met in a dining room on the second floor while the commoners and gray robes stayed in one on the first. Rozemyne’s chefs had prepared several meals that had been placed in a time-stopping magic tool. The one prepared for the first day’s lunch was sandwiches, which the attendants distributed to the nobles. The gray robes took care of serving the commoners and had planned to wait for divine offerings, but as they were not in the temple, Rozemyne ordered them to eat at the same time as everyone else.</p><p>Once the meal was finished, they rested for a bit to give the attendants and priests time to clean up before continuing to the Ahrensbach border gate. While Zent Werdekraf had redrawn borders for Dunkelfelger, Alexandria, Corinzdaum, and likely Drewanchel already, he was waiting for Leidenschaft to fully take up his spear to redraw those for Ehrenfest. As such, they would have to pass through two of Ahrensbach’s provinces to reach the new territory.</p><p>They all landed, and Justus disembarked from Rozemyne’s highbeast to bring the startled guard a written permit to pass through the gate from Aub Ahrensbach. It took the woman a moment to look away from Rozemyne’s house-sized highbeast long enough to inspect the writ of passage, but once she did, she gave a reluctant nod and sent Aub Ahrensbach an ordonnanz, informing him of the nobles passing through.</p><p>A pit of dread opened in Ferdinand’s stomach as he recalled that snowy day and the feeling of emptiness when he turned away from Ehrenfest. Remembering the beautiful blessing Rozemyne had given him, though, calmed his nerves somewhat. He wondered if he’d receive it in this life as well.</p><p>A white bird flew back to the guard, and then she gave the final approval. Once Justus returned, they passed through the border gate without issue and flew over Seitzen and Vulkatak. The lands that seemed to pass slowly beneath them were a much brighter green than in the past weave, though they weren’t quite as vibrant as they should have been. Still, the progress Lucius had made was astounding. While Ferdinand had not come to care much for Ahrensbach, he was glad their people were no longer suffering as they had been.</p><p>The vegetation almost immediately became sparse as soon as they crossed the border. While the lands weren’t wrung dry, they had more brown than green. Ferdinand could almost trace the routes people had used when trying to replenish the land, but pouring mana directly into the soil was akin to adding water to a tub filled halfway with salt until it tasted clean. While it would eventually be possible, it would take so much more water than if they started by removing the salt in the first place, which Zent Werdekraf did by creating a foundation.</p><p>They still had a long way to go, so after their guard knights inspected a clearing, they landed, and Ferdinand put up a shroud of Verbergen over the area with the area magic circle Clarissa had developed. It was nearly time for supper, so while the attendants got to work preparing a simple meal, Ferdinand and Rozemyne elected to go for a brief walk to inspect the grounds. This area would soon be part of Bettendorf, one of the five provinces that was being displaced by the new central district and the first stop in Alexandria after leaving Ehrenfest. The border gate would be situated not too far from where they had landed.</p><p>“It’s not as bad as I was expecting,” Rozemyne said, her eyes trained on the short grass beneath her feet.</p><p>“Most of this growth is new,” Ferdinand said, “meaning either Giebe Bettendorf has started pouring mana into the land, or Aub Ahrensbach had someone do it before the line was redrawn.”</p><p>“Either way, things should improve significantly once you dye the foundation.”</p><p>Ferdinand pulsed mana into his ear cuff, and once they were connected, he said, “They should improve more than you’re expecting. Since the zent gave us the mana and gold dust we need for building the majority of our structures, I have a plan for what we’ve stored up so far.”</p><p>“What’s that?”</p><p>Steadying his nerves, he explained the ritual magic they had used in the previous weave to restore Ahrensbach and expend the last of the gods’ mana from the other Rozemyne. This time, however, he would be contributing as well, and they could use the feystones they had already filled to power the spell. To his surprise, despite knowing the same ritual had been the cause of her other weave’s ascent up the towering staircase, she readily agreed.</p><p>“Why?” he demanded. He’d just told her how he’d failed her in the past weave.</p><p>“I trust you,” was the only explanation she gave.</p><p>It weighed heavily on him.</p><p>By the time they returned, the meal was ready, so Ferdinand escorted Rozemyne up to the dining room on the second floor and sat next to her as they ate. Once the meal was over, he announced that he was going to take a brief flight to inspect the lands. Rozemyne quickly volunteered herself to come, and when Cornelius pointed out that her highbeast would draw too much attention, she said, “Of course, I would be riding with Ferdinand.” As he opened his mouth to protest, Eckhart and Matthias slammed their hands down on either of his shoulders, shutting that nonsense down before it could begin.</p><p>Ferdinand and Rozemyne both gave approving nods to their guard knights before she followed him outside. After summoning his highbeast, he held a hand out to her and helped her up before taking to the skies. It was then that he realized the problem with this scenario.</p><p>In the previous weave, Rozemyne had barely reached his shoulder, having only been forcibly grown large enough to contain the Book of Mestionora. Even then, she had blocked his vision. Now, however, she was growing according to her age and nearly reached his chin, meaning he could see around her even less.</p><p>It didn’t prove a problem for long, however, as she settled back against him, tucking her head under his jaw. She squirmed a bit and then asked, “Ferdinand, can you remove your breastplate? It’s uncomfortable.”</p><p>He recalled then that her old guard knight Bridgette had done so when she’d carried Rozemyne around as a little girl. Sighing, he allowed the feystone armor to melt away. His shameless fiancée settled against him again, her warm back pressed firmly against his chest. The smell of her rinsham swallowed him, and before he realized what he was doing, his arm had crept around her waist to hold her against him. Thankfully, Rozemyne kept both her hands firmly lodged in the lion’s mane, so they could at least pretend at propriety.</p><p>As they flew high over the province, Ferdinand began tracing a mental line of where the trade route would go from where the border gate would be. Looking forward, he caught a glimpse of the giebe’s mansion as the fading rays from the Goddess of Light glinted off the ivory walls. The route could conveniently pass right by it, making both trade and spring prayer easy enough to perform.</p><p>“Oh, look, there’s a river over there!” Rpzemyne cried, pointing to the north. Ferdinand motioned to their guard knights to let them know about the change in direction and flew over to where she had indicated. It wasn’t terribly far off from the trade route he had in mind, so he imagined paper craftsmen would have little difficulty transporting their goods from a workshop erected near the river. Rozemyne leaned over, causing him to tighten his grip on her waist to ensure she didn’t topple over.</p><p>“I think the water is clean enough,” Rozemyne said, righting herself. “They shouldn’t have any trouble making paper here. It’d be convenient to have a workshop here so they could make paper with wood from Ehrenfest. Perhaps we can task Giebe Bettendorf with facilitating trade with Ilgner for us.”</p><p>“Winning people to your side already,” Ferdinand muttered. “On that note, do you have any suggestions for gaining allies?”</p><p>“Harspiel concert,” she answered without so much as a pause for breath.</p><p>He heaved an exaggerated sigh. Was it too much to hope that Elvira’s training would have inspired better ideas after all? “I do not wish to make a spectacle of myself.” It was embarrassing enough the first two times.</p><p>“I think you mean ‘ourselves.’”</p><p>“Come again?”</p><p>She twisted slightly so that she could look up at him. “Of course, I’ll play with you. I’ve already been putting together a set list.”</p><p>“Set list…?”</p><p>“We’ll do it at the beginning of winter socialization before I have to go to the Academy. I was thinking we could do it right after the gifting ceremony. We’ll have so many blue capes to give out compared to Ehrenfest. I’ve been having my scholars review the list of all the nobles Queen Sieglinde’s aid provided us, and it looks like we’ll need to have a few dozen for the first years. That’s if their families choose to stay, of course. We’ll need to brew a couple hundred new broaches for everyone to give out, too. Do you want to do that with me in the fall after your return? We should have more accurate numbers by then, right?”</p><p>Ferdinand raised an eyebrow at her attempt to change the subject so she wouldn’t give him room to protest the concert. Still, he couldn’t ignore the way he was practically salivating at the chance to do so much brewing with his fiancée. If that was her offer in exchange for playing harspiel with her in front of the entire duchy, then he’d happily take it. “I will have Justus leave detailed instructions with Hartmut for the materials we’ll need. Have your guard knights and scholars work on gathering them over the summer. Upon my return, we will begin brewing.”</p><p>Her smile threatened to tear the encroaching God of Darkness’s cloak from the sky.</p><p> </p><p>The following day, Ferdinand had Rozemyne maintain the Shroud of Verbergen over her highbeast to prevent causing a stir amongst the locals. As they traveled, he could see a clear delineation between many of the provinces that had been marked red and those that had been marked blue on the map the Zent had provided them. The distinction wasn’t as pronounced between some of them, but that wasn’t necessarily a good sign. That just meant there were red provinces that needed more mana.</p><p>They made it most of the way to the capital before night fell, but as they were still two provinces away, Ferdinand elected to have them rest one more night before they pushed through to the temple the following morning. They arrived just after third bell, and as they flew over what would become the central districtl, Ferdinand couldn’t help but wince at the clear distinction between the two provinces that had belonged to Old Werkestock and the three that had been part of the Sovereignty. The former looked as bad as Bindewald had in the previous weave when Rozemyne had taken the foundation.</p><p>Well, perhaps the state of affairs would make it easier to buy Werkestock’s support. Giving a few small chalices to them had worked for Georgine, after all.</p><p>“Lord Ferdinand!” Eckhart called.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“There is a group of nobles waiting down near the temple under a canopy. Shall I investigate?”</p><p>Enhancing his vision, Ferdinand dropped down until he could distinguish the individuals below. “One moment.” Activating his ear cuff again, he asked Rozemyne to borrow a few of her retainers, which she readily agreed to. He sent Eckhart, Justus, Cornelius, Leonore, and Hartmut to investigate the strangers while he had Rozemyne land on the other side of the temple, still hidden under the shroud of Verbergen. She likewise sent Laurenz and Matthias into the temple, each under their own shroud.</p><p>Before long, Justus flew up to give his lord an update. “They are the five giebes who are vacating these provinces, their wives, and their retainers. It seems we were spotted flying overhead yesterday, and once they received word, they decided to wait by the temple in order to greet their new Aub.”</p><p>“Did they now?” Ferdinand asked.</p><p>Justus nodded. “We sense no danger, my lord, but it would be best to exercise caution as always. I would suggest bringing Milady with you for this initial meeting as she…has a way with people.”</p><p>Ferdinand glared at his smirk. He didn’t need to be reminded how much better she was at winning allies. Sighing, he activated his ear cuff and apprised his fiancée of the situation. When she agreed to come, he flew down to meet her so that he might give her a proper escort. Once he had her on his highbeast, she used the ear cuff to give a quick report.</p><p>“The Gutenbergs are inside hard at work. They set up shop temporarily in the orphanage workshop and have been diligently installing doors and windows since they arrived. It seems they’re completely unaware of the nobles’ presence.”</p><p>“So they avoided the temple for one reason or another,” Ferdinand said. “That is fortunate.”</p><p>He flew them over to the gathering, Angelica, Damuel, and Justus surrounding them in a protective formation. Liseleta and Janrik followed behind, each carrying a bundle. After he helped his all goddess down, he escorted her to where the nobles knelt with their arms crossed over their chests. The one in front, a middle-aged man with graying orange hair and ocean blue eyes, said, “I am Lord Dietzman, who managed one of the provinces from the Sovereignty that will become the central district. May I pray for a blessing in appreciation of this serendipitous meeting, ordained by the pure rivers flowing from Flutrane the Goddess of Water?”</p><p>“You may,” Ferdinand responded.</p><p>“O Flutrane, Goddess of Water. May you grant my lord and lady your blessing.” The man stood and introduced the rest of the nobles present. As Justus had stated, they were the other two lords from the Sovereignty, Bettendorf and Feldberg, and the two giebes from Werkestock, Weisenberg and Ehrmann, along with their wives. Though they didn’t introduce any of their retainers, Ferdinand immediately recognized two of them as well as one of the wives.</p><p>Sirius, guard knight to Lady Carolina, the wife of Lord Dietzman, was originally from Dunkelfelger and a year below Ferdinand in the Academy. He’d met the man on the ditter field on numerous occasions. Upon graduation, he’d gone to the Sovereignty. The glimmer in his eye matched that of Heischitze, much to Ferdinand’s chagrin.</p><p>The wife of Lord Bettendorf, Lady Tamara, had been in the scholar course two years ahead of Ferdinand. Ordinarily, he wouldn’t have interacted with her much, but as a Drewanchel native, she was among those who eagerly purchased his magic tools after ditter matches.</p><p>Finally, there was Lord Feldberg’s head scholar, Manfried, another Drewanchel native. They’d been in the same year, and he’d come in second to Ferdinand in the scholar course every single year. It had made the man bitter during his Academy days, but he didn’t show a hint of it as he stared at him with eyes as worshipful as Sirius’s.</p><p>Not that Ferdinand trusted such an expression from a scheming Drewanchel. He’d have to keep an eye on him.</p><p>Ferdinand introduced himself as Aub Alexandria and Rozemyne as, “My fiancée and future Aub Alexandria, the incarnation of Mestionora, Rozemyne.” The nobles once again knelt in reverence, their arms crossed and their heads bowed. Out of the corner of his eye, Ferdinand caught Hartmut smirking in approval.</p><p>After the nobles finished worshiping her, the couple was invited to sit, and Hartmut and Eckhart both confirmed the area, along with the canopy, tables, and chairs, had been thoroughly poison checked. Once Ferdinand escorted Rozemyne to her seat, he settled in beside her, watching carefully as Dieztman waved for his attendant to begin serving tea. Janrik and Lieseleta provided their masters with their poison-neutralizing tableware and passed out cookies to their impromptu hosts. They in turn received some sort of honeyed cake Ferdinand didn’t recognize. After the five lords each had a bite, Ferdinand took one to be polite and fought the urge to gag. It was nearly as sweet as anything served in the Sovereignty, and he could barely stomach it enough to swallow it. Rozemyne refrained from touching hers again, instead going back to the cookies, suggesting she found it just as repulsively saccharine.</p><p>Their hosts, in contrast, spoke nothing but words of adoration for Rozemyne’s confections as they quickly disappeared from their plates. She absolutely delighted them as she began describing new treats she planned to debut as trends in the winter, asking if they would be so kind as to give their honest opinions of them at a tea party before she had to return to the Academy.</p><p>And just like that, Rozemyne began building her faction.</p><p>She went on to ask about current fashion trends amongst the nobles of Alexandria as well as the industries that were represented. The Sovereign provinces this far south were focused largely on agriculture, and both Rozemyne and Ferdinand perked up with interest as they described foods neither of them had heard of before.</p><p>The giebes from Werkestock explained that their provinces also had a heavy agricultural presence before the civil war but had turned to wood working after. Unfortunately, even that business had been waning as the forests thinned. However, not to be outdone by the Sovereign lords, they started to list the crops grown in the territory formerly managed by Ahrensbach. While crop yields were at record lows as a result of mana drought, one of the foods described made Rozemyne’s eyes glow like the moon on a cloudless night. It was described as a round, purple grain that grew in stalks but had a mild flavor. It sounded disgustingly bland to Ferdinand, but whatever it was had inspired the blessing of Cuococalura in his all goddess, so he was willing to try whatever dish she concocted with it.</p><p>When she asked about trying it, Giebe Weisenberg gave a nervous laugh as his hand went to the back of his neck. “The mana drought in our lands has been…quite severe. Of course, I’m certain if there is any lilareise to be had, the giebes of those regions would happily provide the Aub and his Goddess of Light with as much as they can harvest.”</p><p>“Is it a summer crop?” she asked.</p><p>Weisenberg shook his head. “Fall. Planting season will be starting soon, but it takes so much mana to produce…”</p><p>Ferdinand groaned internally, already knowing where this was heading. Before Rozemyne could go on a full rampage, he stepped in. “That should prove little to no issue next year.”</p><p>His lovely fiancée shot him a smile sharp enough to slice through bone as Weisenberg and Ehrmann both gaped at them.</p><p>“Do you mean…?” Weisenberg began.</p><p>“Even with just two suppliers, you could provide enough mana to grow lilareise by <em>next year</em>?” Ehrmann gasped.</p><p>“Of course not,” Rozemyne cut in, smiling despite how the two giebes deflated. “We can do it by next season.”</p><p>Ferdinand felt a noble smile begin to creep across his face. The moment they were alone, he was going to pinch her thinning cheeks until she cried.</p><p>“When you say next season…” Ehrmann began.</p><p>“I mean when Leidenschaft takes up his spear, yes,” she replied.</p><p>Everyone in the tent stared at her in stunned silence.</p><p>Gods, this girl… The only way to control the rampage at this point was to direct it rather than attempt to stop it. He’d planned on doing the ritual later so that the nobles of their new duchy would know who to thank. As it was, they were going to see a magic circle in the sky and then have greener fields without anyone knowing what had happened other than those sitting in the tent.</p><p>Well, if he used this to gain their support, they would quickly spread word amongst their allies. He was already committed now regardless. “After I cast the entwickeln to build the capital,” he said, “Rozemyne and I will perform a ritual to replenish all of the lands of Alexandria.”</p><p>Weisenberger leapt to his feet, nearly knocking over his teacup. “Y-you mean to restore the mana to <em>all</em> of Alexandria?! With a single ritual?!”</p><p>Ferdinand fought to keep the censure from his tone as he replied, “Yes. I did say she was the incarnation of a goddess, did I not?”</p><p>Rozemyne’s smile tightened as Hartmut practically glowed with exuberance behind her. In an effort to change the subject, she asked, “You have worked closely with your commoners over the years, yes?”</p><p>The two men glanced at each other with mild concern as Weisenberg slowly sank back into his chair before Ehrmann replied with a nervous smile, “We in Ehrmann live by the motto, ‘Neighbors looking out for neighbors,’ and as a more…rural province, we’ve always counted commoners among our neighbors. It is therefore a matter of course that we have had more interactions with our commoners than perhaps many archduke candidates are accustomed to.”</p><p>She gave him a reassuring smile as she said, “Oh, you must not have heard. I was named High Bishop of Ehrenfest upon my baptism, just as I will serve as High Bishop here. All of the archduke candidates traveled the duchy for Spring Prayer and the Harvest Festival, and many of the industries I started rely on the hard work of commoner merchants and craftspeople. I do not disparage anyone for working with or looking after their people. In fact, I was hoping you would answer in the affirmative.”</p><p>Their surprised silence allowed her to continue her explanation. “Many of the commoners from your provinces may wish to relocate to the new capital city. We will provide assistance with moving them either to the new downtown area or to the border provinces if they would rather follow you, but Aub Alexandria and I would like your help in putting that into motion. We’ll need to know who is moving where and what needs they have.”</p><p>Ehrmann placed a hand on the back of his neck as his forehead began to glisten. “Th-that is most generous of you, but we could never dare–”</p><p>“Let me stop you there and explain,” Rozemyne said. “Alexandria is the Wisdom of the Zent, and the capital will be a library city that will house every book ever printed in Yurgenschmidt. This, in addition to our own printing industry and the trends I plan to spread, will draw visitors from far and wide. Aub Alexandria and I already plan to build several large inns, a restaurant, and a culinary school in the downtown area. In order to cast a successful entwickeln, we need to know what else is needed. What workshops, stores, and facilities do our people require? What about residences? Since you’ve worked closely with your commoners, you should be able to ask them these questions directly, no?” Her gaze turned from the shaken duo to the lords of the Sovereignty. “I would ask the same of you as well.”</p><p>“Of course, Lady Rozemyne,” Lord Feldberg replied immediately. His eyes had a glow that was beginning to take on the color of Hartmut’s and Clarissa’s. Ferdinand was glad the man would be going to the far side of the duchy soon. “We will have all the information you require prepared as soon as possible.”</p><p>Lord Bettendorf tapped his chin as he asked, “When would you need this by, my lord?”</p><p>Ferdinand lowered his tea cup and said, “I will leave at the end of summer and return at the beginning of winter. As moving during winter will prove difficult, I will require your analyses by the Starbind Ceremony so that my scholars and I can prepare the necessary blueprints before the end of summer.” He still needed to create the castle before Rozemyne left and Gervasio arrived, so he would have the noble’s district along with the library and city walls built within the next couple of days. He would wait to build the downtown area until he had more information.</p><p>The gathered nobles all nodded with determination, though Bettendorf and Dietzman paled at the tight timeline. Ferdinand wanted to scoff at them. They merely had to ask their commoners what they needed. He was having to create an entire capital and establish a duchy within a season. <em>Alone.</em></p><p>Rozemyne gave them an apologetic smile. “We understand this will be a burden on everyone involved, but restoring the land and ensuring our people are able to move into their new homes are our top priorities.”</p><p>“N-no, my l-lady!” Weisenberger stammered. “It’s not a burden at all! If anything, we couldn’t be more grateful!”</p><p>Ferdinand hoped the rest of Werkestock and Scharfer were as easily bought.</p><p>That business settled, Rozemyne turned to Lady Carolina and said, “I couldn’t help but notice your bracelet. Do I see five elements represented?”</p><p>Carolina’s smile brightened as she showed off the piece. The five feystones were set into a simple but elegant bracelet with tasteful engravings representing the elements surrounding each. It wasn’t bad in Ferdinand’s estimation.</p><p>“Indeed,” the woman said. “It was a gift from my dear husband after Entrinduge’s first visit. Oh, but that was so long ago. I’m almost embarrassed to still wear it.”</p><p>“Oh, it couldn’t have been that long ago!” Rozemyne insisted.</p><p>Placing a hand on her cheek, Carolina replied with a pleased voice, “Fourteen years this summer. It’s hard to believe my little Katharina will be starting her fifth year at the Academy this winter.”</p><p>Rozemyne’s expression brightened as Ferdinand smirked inwardly. The girl was on the list of those for his fiancée to consider taking as retainers. “Katharina?” she asked. “She wouldn’t happen to be taking the knight course, would she?”</p><p>“Oh, my! Indeed, she is!” Carolina replied.</p><p>Lord Bettendorf leaned forward. “Do you know of my daughter, Lady Rozemyne?”</p><p>Rozemyne kept her noble smile in place as she tilted her head. “Well, Queen Sieglinde did mention her to me. I have been looking forward to meeting her.”</p><p>“How delightful!” he replied. “Depending on how long you’re planning to stay, we could arrange a tea party if you would like.”</p><p>“We’ll have to see,” Ferdinand replied with a sociable smile before Rozemyne could thoughtlessly agree. She was only prepared to stay for so long, and there was much work for her to do in Ehrenfest. Her departure had already been delayed by another day thanks to the Zent’s visit and now performing the entwickeln and ancient ritual so soon after their arrival.</p><p>“Oh, Lord Feldberg, my understanding is that you have a son entering his third year at the Academy, do you not?” Rozemyne asked, lifting her tea cup to her lips. It seemed she was going to try to lock in everyone she could in the span of a single impromptu tea party.</p><p>He straightened up. “I do, my lady. He will be taking the scholar course.”</p><p>“Oh, how wonderful!” she replied, clapping her hands together. “Please let him know if he has any questions regarding the scholar course, I will be more than happy to answer them. I look forward to meeting him!”</p><p>His expression suggested he would force his son to become her retainer whether the boy wanted to or not. Ferdinand noticed Hartmut taking note of the man.</p><p>Ferdinand decided he might as well follow suit and turned to Dietzman. “Queen Sieglinde suggested your sister and her husband would be amenable to working in the castle. Is that still the case?”</p><p>“Oh! Yes, my lord!” the lord replied. The man’s sister Octavia was an archattendant while her husband Caliban was an archknight. Rozemyne might not decide to take Octavia as a retainer, but even so, her services could still be utilized in the castle. Ferdinand wasn’t certain what he would do with Caliban yet, but they would need competent guards regardless.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lady Seraphina, Lord Feldberg’s wife, complimented Rozemyne’s hairpin.</p><p>Tossing her head to show off the seven rainbow feystones, she thanked her and explained, “It was a gift from my fiancé. It actually acts as a protective charm in addition to a lovely accessory.”</p><p>“Oh, then did he make it himself?” Lady Margarete, Geibe Ehrmann’s wife, asked.</p><p>Rozemyne placed a bashful hand on her cheek and said with downcast eyes, “Why, yes, he did. His craftsmanship is exceptional, isn’t it?”</p><p>Lady Tamara giggled. “My, he was always gifted in the Academy, but I see he’s only improved since I left.”</p><p>“You were in the Academy with him?” Rozemyne asked, leaning forward with sparkling eyes.</p><p>Tamara smirked. “Yes, and I have quite a few stories to tell.”</p><p>“Excuse me,” Ferdinand said. “It seems Dregarnuhr the Goddess of Time has woven today's threads with exceptional speed and grace. We have much to prepare.”</p><p>“Of course,” Lord Dietzman said as Tamara tittered. “We pray that Dregarnuhr the Goddess of Time has woven our threads of fate tightly together.”</p><p>Once they parted ways, Ferdinand escorted Rozemyne towards the temple. “You should be able to bring everyone else out of your highbeast once the nobles are out of sight,” he told her. She nodded and as he reached the gate, she gave his hand a gentle squeeze before heading for her highbeast.</p><p>After Rozemyne rounded the corner, Ferdinand passed a sound-blocking tool to Justus along with an amulet of Verbergen. “Investigate those nobles as well as the ones in the surrounding area,” he ordered. “If you find any threats, inform me immediately.”</p><p>“Yes, my lord,” Justus replied with a smile. He wouldn’t be able to slip away until evening, but if an opportunity to dig up information presented itself before then, he was at least equipped to take full advantage of it.</p><p>Before long, Rozemyne and everyone who had been left behind in her highbeast entered the courtyard. “Hmm… Feels like home, doesn’t it, Fran?” she asked.</p><p>He gave a curt nod, though his smile was peaceful. “Yes, my lady. I look forward to working under you and Lord Ferdinand – excuse me, Aub Alexandria – in this new temple.”</p><p>The other gray robes nodded in agreement, smiling just as warmly.</p><p>As Rozemyne approached Ferdinand, she held out her hand, and he took it to escort her. “Shall we go check on your Gutenbergs and our accommodations?”</p><p>“Yes,” she replied, “and then the bookroom.”</p><p>“There aren’t any books inside.”</p><p>“Yet.”</p><p>He gave a brief snort. “As you will.”</p>
